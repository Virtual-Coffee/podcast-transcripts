1
00:00:08,294 --> 00:00:11,925
Bekah: Hello and welcome
to Season 6 of the

2
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:15,824
Virtual Coffee podcast.
We are live and in person

3
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:21,089
at Kansas city developers.
This should be our 50th 50th

4
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:24,089
episode of the podcast, but we
had some technical difficulties

5
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:27,149
and this is the 49th.
This is the 49th, but we're

6
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:28,559
gonna pretend like it's very
special and that it is the 50th.

7
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,719
Dan: Sure. Yeah.
Well, if we publish it, yeah.

8
00:00:30,725 --> 00:00:31,230
After then it

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,570
Bekah: will.
So this is definitely

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,990
the 50th episode of the
Virtual Coffee podcast. And

11
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:40,320
Dan: here with me today,

12
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:45,390
Bekah: here with me
today is my cohost. Wuddup, Bek?

13
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:47,729
How's it going? Hey, it's going?
Yeah, it's going good.

14
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:50,130
Done with my talk and I'm
very happy to, she did great.

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,679
I, it wasn't my best performance.

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,659
Dan: No, it was good. No, I saw

17
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:56,939
Bekah: it. It happened.
You didn't see it. It was okay.

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,700
You can't.
So people got up and left

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,590
during my talk and then
I, it was very thrown off.

20
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:02,729
I feel like they just,
and I said something that

21
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,140
was funny and nobody left.
I left and then I was

22
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:07,439
like, I'm not really. funny.

23
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,319
Dan: Yeah, Bekah did a
great job at her at talk.

24
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:15,659
Todd, I did an okay.
Talk another Virtual

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,609
Coffee member. Todd.
I saw his talk

26
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:18,900
right before yours.
That was also really good.

27
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,819
But Tom cud is
Tom's is tomorrow.

28
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:30,420
I think Who else? Krista Mars.
Chris is now I think

29
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:35,250
actually, yeah. Sorry Chris.
Yeah. Yeah,

30
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,599
Bekah: Hmm. this has been good.
We got up and got to do in

31
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,620
person coffee this morning,
which was a lot of fun.

32
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,310
And now we're gonna be answering
some of the questions that

33
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,750
you all submitted and I think,
yeah, we'll do it start. Yeah,

34
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,650
Dan: we
were supposed to do this live,

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,909
but there's no wifi here.
That's good. So we're recording.

36
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,680
and We're gonna publish it. Yes.
In a little bit.

37
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:01,349
Bekah: Yeah. So sometime.
Ready to get started with

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,540
some questions, I guess.
So, so we've got some

39
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:06,120
anonymous questions.
I've only viewed one of

40
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,530
them and the others we
have not viewed at all.

41
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:12,270
So we'll see what those are.
And we have some that are

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,009
not anonymous and we'll
go through those as well. okay.

43
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,289
The, the first question is
an anonymous one and it is

44
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,060
what time do you go to sleep?

45
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,030
Dan: Hmm.
I try to go to sleep like

46
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,030
10 ish most days, you know,

47
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:31,724
Bekah: Yeah, I feel like
that's also what I go for.

48
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:36,465
Last night we said we
would go to sleep at 11.

49
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:37,995
Well, you said that I
never promised that. Okay.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,115
Well, I said, Dan, I'll
meet you from 10 to 11 mm-hmm

51
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,854
and then we stayed up

52
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:46,125
Dan: later.
Yeah, well, we had catching

53
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:49,604
up to do and my plane
got delayed to infinity

54
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:51,314
and so I finally made it. Yeah.
And

55
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:53,775
Bekah: bekah,
and then somebody challenged

56
00:02:51,675 --> 00:02:56,205
my ability to weight lift.
then I, I had to take

57
00:02:56,205 --> 00:02:56,715
care of that. Was

58
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:59,205
Dan: it challenging your ability.
He was challenging, like

59
00:02:57,405 --> 00:03:00,854
your form, which is, I
think even more ridiculous. is

60
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:05,294
Bekah: this, how do you show
me how you, how dare you, first

61
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:07,514
Dan: of all,
I just don't think he knew who

62
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,365
he was talking to, you know? No.
Yeah,

63
00:03:08,985 --> 00:03:11,115
Bekah: yeah. Don't challenge my
weightlift form.

64
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:12,604
Don't mansplain my

65
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:15,854
Dan: especially not
at 1145 a night at a, at a bar.

66
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:16,335
Yeah.

67
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:18,944
Bekah: Yeah.
It all ended peacefully though.

68
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:20,985
I am happy to report. I She

69
00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:24,615
Dan: deadlifted that guy.
And then, You know,

70
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,615
threw him into the

71
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:26,354
Bekah: street. out her Uhhuh.
Yep, exactly.

72
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,694
That's exactly what I did.
I did not.

73
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:33,074
I was very kind to him.
Maybe I can't promise. Okay.

74
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:38,655
All right. Alright.
Let me, let's go with the

75
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:38,715
anonymous questions first. who

76
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:40,455
Dan: wait, was that
first one anonymous?

77
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,699
Bekah: That was an anonymous one.
It was in your Yeah, because I

78
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,430
wrote it down before. Okay.
Oh, you looked at, because I was

79
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:49,800
afraid it was gonna disappear.
I never used this

80
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,659
anonymous app thing before.
And so I wasn't sure,

81
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,800
like I opened it now,
is this like Snapchat?

82
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,949
And it goes away after
50 seconds or something.

83
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,560
I'm not sure how Snapchat works.
Yeah. Technology. I have no idea.

84
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,219
All right. So I hope that these
are all appropriate.

85
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,930
well that one says Netflix
and chill, so, well, Hey,

86
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:15,224
that's just, there we go.
Please give me pickup lines.

87
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:16,454
That always work

88
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:20,954
Dan: well, that's not a question.
So that's a demand.

89
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:24,404
We don't, they failed, they
failed the, we don't negotiate.

90
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,254
I mean, just read
the instructions. People.

91
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:30,194
It's not hard.
We were looking for

92
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:30,194
questions, not demands.

93
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:35,355
Bekah: All right, here we go.
What extra work goes

94
00:04:32,324 --> 00:04:38,774
into landing a full-time
international remote role

95
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:42,689
as a first role out of
web dev bootcamp, with no

96
00:04:38,774 --> 00:04:44,399
prior developer experience.
That's a really good question.

97
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,110
I feel like this is
something that we talk a

98
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,240
lot about at Virtual Coffee.
Maybe not so much the landing,

99
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:54,089
an international remote
role, because that's a

100
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,329
little bit more challenging.
Not all companies can work

101
00:04:54,089 --> 00:05:01,290
internationally, so you really
need to narrow it down to

102
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:03,720
see what companies allow for
international remote work. Right.

103
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,889
Dan: yeah.
And, and, and those points

104
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,579
you're gonna have to start.
looking And see if the companies

105
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:13,800
have like supported visa stuff
and, you know, lawyers to

106
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:17,850
help you, things like that.
There's a lot of like laws

107
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:20,310
and rules and things that
can come into play, I think

108
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,550
with international stuff. Right.

109
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,540
Bekah: Yeah, for sure.

110
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,319
Dan: But if you set that,
that part of it aside

111
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,350
a little bit, right.
What kind of stuff can we

112
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:30,254
do coming out of bootcamp
to like land your first job?

113
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:33,045
Bekah: Yeah, I was just talking
to someone about this recently.

114
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:35,685
She's gonna be learning how
to code in a couple of months.

115
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:42,884
She's a mom of a couple of. kids.
And I, I think that once you're

116
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:45,464
getting close to applying
for jobs, working with other

117
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:47,564
people and building projects
together is something that

118
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:49,964
can really help you stand
apart because there's a lot

119
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:53,399
of people coming out of boot
camps right But a lot of them

120
00:05:49,964 --> 00:05:55,319
have experience where they've
just worked on their own stuff.

121
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,060
They haven't worked
collaboratively.

122
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:00,120
They don't communicate
aloud with other. developers.

123
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,310
And when you're going into those
interviews, you're going to have

124
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,180
to communicate aloud about code.
And that can be, I know

125
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:06,990
for me, that was a really
hard learning curve.

126
00:06:06,995 --> 00:06:11,220
I was not good at speaking
code words out loud,

127
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,540
Dan: Speaking code
words out loud. Yeah.

128
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,519
Bekah: Mm-hmm ,
Dan: I mean, that's a

129
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,769
but like, I think that
so I told you

130
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:16,769
I wasn't good at it.

131
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:18,899
Dan: I, I mean, I
totally agree with that.

132
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:22,050
I, I, mean, I'm always a
proponent building things,

133
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,560
you know, as a way to learn.
And I think, yeah, I think

134
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:28,439
building something with
other people is also very

135
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,370
important, skill.
to like Start to it.

136
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,269
It Doesn't always like,
isn't always taught, right.

137
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,259
It Isn't always
taught in a classroom.

138
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:37,139
I know that like, lots of
bootcamps do have collaborative

139
00:06:37,144 --> 00:06:40,439
projects It's part of their
curriculum, but, it's a

140
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,300
little different, I suppose,
when it's not a school

141
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,170
Bekah: Yeah.

142
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,639
Dan: Project or, you
know, bootcamp, whatever

143
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,500
a classroom situation.
But yeah, like learning

144
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,839
that that's like one of the,
especially if you're hiring a

145
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,399
junior role like that, where
you're gonna be interviewing

146
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,800
where you're expecting to
hire somebody, at that.

147
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,709
level, those sorts of
skills are something they

148
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,949
can set you as like far
apart from, from other

149
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:04,290
people from in the same boat.
Right.

150
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:09,404
You know, they all like
the the, the, like breadth

151
00:07:09,464 --> 00:07:11,894
of technical skills at that
level will be like pretty

152
00:07:11,894 --> 00:07:15,435
tight and so ways to ways
to like set yourself apart.

153
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,925
I think communication skills
is like a huge one, right?

154
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:20,204
I mean, if I, if I have if
I'm interviewing with somebody

155
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:22,495
and they can, they can sort
of speak well and have.

156
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:26,949
some like, I mean, speak
well about, about code, like

157
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,740
you were saying, use code
words, like whatever that sort

158
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,839
of thing are used to, like
talking out loud or explaining

159
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,129
some processes, or even just
explaining how a thing works

160
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:40,810
that you built, you know? Yeah.
Even if it's a thing that's

161
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:44,129
for bootcamp, maybe lots of
times, I've never been to do

162
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,180
bootcamp, so I don't know, you
would turn in the assignment.

163
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,800
I don't know.
Do you do like presentations

164
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,060
Bekah: After you. We did.
So for each of our, we

165
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:52,259
had like a series of
projects that we had to do.

166
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:56,189
And so after each one we had
to walk through the code and

167
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:59,850
then for the last one, they
asked us questions and we had

168
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,240
to add on a feature depending
on what the interviewer,

169
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:07,845
felt would work for the
application that you created.

170
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,024
Okay. So there was live coding
that was involved in that. Nice.

171
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:14,204
That's cool. Yeah.
And I feel like you

172
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:17,115
can get somebody who.
is experienced in the industry

173
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:20,324
to do the same thing with you.
So if you have sure, a project

174
00:08:17,115 --> 00:08:23,504
that you're using as a portfolio
project, then what you can do

175
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:24,764
is say like, Hey, would you mind
walking through this with me?

176
00:08:24,764 --> 00:08:27,915
Suggest like what I can
do, do a code review with

177
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:31,665
somebody, just so you get an
understanding of like whether

178
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:38,129
or not your code is written.
Well, I think that you'll always

179
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:42,539
be able to improve on your code.
but When you're doing it

180
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:45,299
in isolation and you're
often just trying to see,

181
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:48,299
like, does this work right?
You know, there's more that goes

182
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:51,389
into coding than does this work.
Yeah. Is it, is it written

183
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:51,389
well or efficiently?

184
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:53,309
Dan: Yeah.
Oh, I, think that's great.

185
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:56,355
And I think, another path
to practice, that sort of

186
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:58,044
thing is open source as well.
Yeah.

187
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,674
And another thing that we talk
about a lot, in Virtual

188
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:04,544
Coffee at this podcast,
is it's another great way.

189
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,085
to Practice those skills
and prac, you know, see

190
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:12,945
what works and, and,
and join other code bases.

191
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:16,875
And like, that's another skill
that is, is, sometimes

192
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,460
maybe a harder one to not harder
one to learn, but maybe not

193
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,710
an obvious one to learn Yeah.
is like how to dig into a,

194
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:28,700
an unfamiliar code base. Right.
And there's like, there's,

195
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:31,370
there's some things that you
can do to make it easier, but

196
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,879
in general, it's very much just.
practice.

197
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,549
It will, you know, like if
you practice it, it will,

198
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:38,389
you'll get better at it.
And so there's a million billion

199
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:39,980
projects out there on ghetto
that all are looking for help.

200
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,690
And, you know, I
don't know, jump in. Yeah.

201
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,879
I, we have a lot of episodes
where we've talked about

202
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,575
like all, the reasons why
it's a good idea to do it.

203
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:56,205
And like also like the,
things to do to, to get over

204
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:58,995
some anxiety you might, may
have about, about doing that

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,725
as a, as a junior developer.
Like just jump in or,

206
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:06,945
you know, do some peer
poor requests on, just

207
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:07,784
documentation or whatever,
just to get your feet wet.

208
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:10,004
Like that kind of thing.
There's like a

209
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:10,514
lot of stuff like that. So,

210
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:13,394
Bekah: yeah.
And I think also it's a

211
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:16,394
pretty easy ask to say like,
Hey, I really wanna get

212
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:17,759
started in open source, I'm
a little nervous about this.

213
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,700
Is there anybody out
there that would be up for

214
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,730
mentoring me through it?
If I'm struggling. Yeah.

215
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:26,070
And then that way, you
know, you can pair up with

216
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:28,259
someone, you can work on those
communication skills and then

217
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:30,779
you don't have to feel nervous
about what you're doing.

218
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:31,799
You have that support

219
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,700
Dan: agreed and, absolutely
agreed and like join Virtual

220
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,580
Coffee, you know, it's,
there's a lot of people

221
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,370
that are always down to help
with that sort of thing.

222
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:43,649
And it's good.

223
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:44,519
Bekah: Yeah.

224
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,960
Dan: All right.
Before we go on, I'm getting

225
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:50,009
really nervous that I forgot to
hit record or it didn't work.

226
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:51,539
So I'm just gonna go look
at Go check it really quick.

227
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,669
Yeah, no, we're good.

228
00:10:56,909 --> 00:10:59,490
Bekah: We're good. We're good.
We've been recording. Excellent.

229
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:01,350
Cause I was gonna make you
do the whole thing over.

230
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:02,639
Yeah, that would be okay.
So let's see.

231
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,870
Did we, so your first role,
and, and along with landing

232
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,169
your first role, I think
always finding community,

233
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,259
finding people and remembering
that like your network is

234
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,330
not just the people, you
know, it's the network of the

235
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,230
people, you know, so yeah.
making connections that

236
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:22,875
are not transactional.
Hey, I want to know

237
00:11:19,815 --> 00:11:29,085
you so I can get a job. Right?
Like get to know people and

238
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:31,065
be their friends be kind don't
criticize their deadlift form.

239
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:33,945
and then you you'll have
a better shot at finding

240
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:38,865
Dan: a job. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Probably, probably just

241
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:40,725
in general, not giving UN
you know, giving advice to

242
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:43,065
people who didn't ask for
it, you know, especially

243
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:43,065
people you don't know.

244
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:44,835
Bekah: I mean,
like generally speaking.

245
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,975
Like it, when people give me
advice, I know that that's

246
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,345
like kind of controversial,
cuz a lot of people are

247
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:53,955
like, don't give me advice.
I didn't ask for it.

248
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:57,884
But I, I don't know.
I like to hear what

249
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:59,384
other people have to say.
And I often ask for advice a lot.

250
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:03,434
I guess that's another bit of
advice is ask, ask for advice

251
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:06,735
because not everybody's just
going, to give it to you. Also.

252
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:09,615
Sometimes advice is bad.
People get bad advice also true.

253
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,924
Like also his deadlift
stance yesterday.

254
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:14,235
I'll get over that
in a couple of weeks.

255
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:19,424
Dan: Yeah.
I'm personally shocked

256
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:21,855
that the drunk guy at the
bar last night didn't have

257
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:21,855
perfect, deadlift form.

258
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:25,965
Bekah: All right, let's
go to the next one.

259
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:27,164
Dan: Okay. Next question.

260
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:29,924
Bekah: I don't know what
that says and what happened?

261
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:33,735
Oh, no, I don't know.
It might not. Let me answer.

262
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:36,825
Wait a minute.
I don't wanna do that.

263
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,384
How does a computer get drunk?

264
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:46,679
Dan: Well,
do you know the answer?

265
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,610
Bekah: No

266
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,080
Dan: Screenshots.

267
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,929
Bekah: did you
submit that question?

268
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:57,720
Dan: I, did. I did. That was me.
this is a good one.

269
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:00,840
Bekah: Right?
Who was the last dude? You texted

270
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:02,220
Dan: Jesus Christ people.

271
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,335
Bekah: Let's see,
probably Dan, probably

272
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:12,225
you, you were the last one.
I texted,

273
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:16,725
Dan: Yes. I don't know.
I mean, are you asking me

274
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:16,725
cuz I don't know.

275
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:18,615
Bekah: I don't know.
who you texted. I, I didn't.

276
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:19,875
Dan: You did text me recently.

277
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,514
Bekah: I did recently text
you about this conference.

278
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:25,014
Who was the last dude you texted?
Mm,

279
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:31,004
Dan: I dunno, My, one of my
friends, one of my friends

280
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:32,745
just took his dog out in the
canoe for the first time.

281
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,144
And so he was sharing
pictures of that and I said,

282
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:35,945
that's cool.

283
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:36,664
Bekah: Nice.

284
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:37,304
Dan: Yeah,

285
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:39,825
Bekah: That was excellent.
So, so there, there you have it.

286
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:42,585
We did really well.
Those anonymous

287
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:45,524
questions were fantastic.
Thank you all for doing such

288
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:51,065
a good job of sending them.
We do have a handful

289
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:54,600
of non-anonymous question.
anonymous, unanimous question

290
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:55,139
Dan: unanimous?

291
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,519
Bekah: Mm-hmm  I think that's
the right word.

292
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:59,100
Dan: Un-Anonymous. I think

293
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:05,340
Bekah: un-anonymous.
I wrote one of 'em down.

294
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,970
Oh, So I wouldn't forget. Okay.
This one comes from Meg

295
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,029
Dan: Is this notebook from
like 1920 or something.

296
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,340
Bekah: Listen, I keep
buying these notebooks.

297
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,500
They sell them at TJ,
max in a pack of three.

298
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,559
This one says the right stuff.
I like these notebooks.

299
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:20,519
Dan: Look at the inside though.
Show them the

300
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:22,544
Bekah: What's wrong
with the inside.

301
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:26,684
Dan: It looks like it's,
you know, paper from the

302
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:27,644
civil war or something.

303
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:31,004
Bekah: is that what civil
war paper looked like?

304
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:32,424
Dan: I don't know, but probably

305
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,475
Bekah: I think you're wrong.
And a. liar.

306
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:36,884
Dan: Oh, and here we go.

307
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:38,325
Bekah: All right.
This one's from Meg.

308
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:40,865
Is there anything you
would've done differently

309
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:44,355
when it comes to Virtual
Coffee, setup, organization,

310
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,565
time, commitment, et cetera.
You go first.

311
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:50,745
Dan: I mean, that's a
really good question, it's

312
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:53,174
hard to have an answer for
it because, everything

313
00:14:50,745 --> 00:14:54,825
that like has happened has
been so organic, you know? Yeah.

314
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:58,379
And you you like you think
about all the things that

315
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:02,519
we have going on right now.
Like everything that's

316
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:05,429
in play and, and. like, Yeah.
Like I can think of a

317
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:07,710
lot of things that could
be better or, you know,

318
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:11,909
right now, or whatever.
But, I think if we had

319
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:16,004
started from scratch in like,
we're like, let's try to build

320
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:19,965
this community, but like start,
you know, I don't know who

321
00:15:16,095 --> 00:15:20,475
knows what we would've done.
You know what I mean?

322
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:22,845
And it probably, I don't
know It's a good chance.

323
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,254
It wouldn't have worked.
Maybe, you know what I mean?

324
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:27,764
Like, yeah.
Like I'd like to think it

325
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:30,445
would've, but the, the.
One of the beauties of the, of

326
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:33,164
the community of the  Virtual
Coffee community is, is the

327
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:34,184
sort of organic, like nature
of how all that started.

328
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,644
And Of course, all that was
like around you, but like

329
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:41,514
it's, and it's like, one of the
reasons Virtual Coffee is sort

330
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:43,195
of different and successful.
Yeah.

331
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:48,504
I feel like, as opposed,
to, like, I'm trying to think

332
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:51,414
of an example, but, you know,
I suppose there's people who

333
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:53,575
are like, I'm gonna start
a community or something,

334
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:56,784
and sometimes they're cool
and sometimes they're not. but.

335
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,039
You never know what it's
like, you never know what's

336
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,070
gonna happen until it
happens with, with like

337
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,090
groups of people, you know?

338
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:03,509
Bekah: Yeah.

339
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:08,389
Dan: So I don't know.
mean, I could think

340
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,250
of, I don't know.
I could think of like a lot

341
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:14,399
of like little instant, like
instances of times that like,

342
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:18,769
okay, I wish I made a different
decision there, you know, but

343
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:23,570
that's, that's less like, that's
more just like I make mistakes,

344
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:26,149
not, not so much like, you
know, tactical, like planning

345
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,149
stuff, you know what I mean?

346
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,480
Bekah: Yeah.

347
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,750
Dan: I dunno. what about you?

348
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,690
Bekah: Well, I think it's nice
because, because of like the

349
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,889
authenticity and the organic
evolution of Virtual Coffee,

350
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:38,120
that we have more freedom
to make mistakes almost. Right.

351
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,179
Dan: Yeah.

352
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,000
Bekah: Because we know that
the people who are coming

353
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,519
to Virtual Coffee are okay
with that because they know

354
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,470
that we're human beings
we do get things wrong.

355
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,980
Sometimes I for sure have
gotten things wrong on a number

356
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,870
of things at Virtual Coffee.
And you. know, You, you try

357
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:57,269
and get 'em right.
The next time you learn

358
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,110
your lesson, you apologize
when you need to.

359
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:04,480
And I, I think a lot about
what I would do differently,

360
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,250
but I actually think it's
kind of a strength that we

361
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,279
had no idea what we were
doing in the beginning.

362
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,519
Dan: Yeah.

363
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,920
Bekah: Because you know,
now that I'm community

364
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,079
professionally, I'm like
diving into things like

365
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:25,710
metrics and planning.
and a lot of different like

366
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:27,960
processes and procedures that I
wouldn't have considered before.

367
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:31,680
And I think that sometimes it
actually makes me less creative

368
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,470
with what the community will
look like, because I see

369
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,740
what everybody else is doing.
And it feels like these are

370
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,259
the things that you should
be doing if you're building

371
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,460
a community, because this
is what the experts say.

372
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,180
And I'm like, sometimes
I get caught in it, like

373
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,369
thinking about Virtual Coffee
and I'm like, no, you know,

374
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:52,920
this is, that's not true.
to Who we are as a community.

375
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,009
Dan: Right.

376
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,519
Bekah: But I'm like
trying to think too,

377
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:08,619
what I would do differently.
I, I think I would find more

378
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:12,315
ways early on to allow people
to support the efforts of

379
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:14,775
Virtual Coffee, to provide
more autonomy for members

380
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:18,644
to do their own things.
Like I'm really enjoying

381
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:20,954
seeing the coffee table groups.
grow And the different

382
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:24,045
things that we're doing,
Ray is doing the Virtual

383
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:27,974
Coffee speech club now.
And like, I love that that's

384
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:31,875
one of my favorite things,
but like finding more ways

385
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:34,394
to empower people to do that.
Like, honestly, I wish that

386
00:18:32,295 --> 00:18:38,535
I had more time in the day
because I think that we have

387
00:18:34,394 --> 00:18:42,914
so great people at Virtual
Coffee that are willing to

388
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:47,174
provide support for yeah.
A lot of different

389
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:53,325
things and finding.
More ways to empower them to do

390
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:55,335
that is one of those things that
I still wish that I could do

391
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:55,755
better.

392
00:18:55,904 --> 00:19:00,434
Dan: Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, that's a hard problem.

393
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,144
And, you know, I, I know of
both from my experience and

394
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,994
from like talking to other
people, it's very hard to find

395
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:10,755
people that are willing to
like put time and effort into

396
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,585
something like a volunteer
thing like that, you know?

397
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:17,234
And I think that just.
goes To show how awesome

398
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,615
Virtual Coffee is that we
have all these people that are

399
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,795
doing this stuff, you know,
and the, the coffee table

400
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:25,119
groups, all, almost all of
them started before we like,

401
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:25,599
just on their own, you know?
Right. Yeah.

402
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,910
Like before we had anything
around them, like we are

403
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,424
building stuff to support them
because they exist already,

404
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:35,055
you know, as opposed to, like,
we had some idea for coffee

405
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:37,194
table groups, and then we're
trying to find people to, to

406
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,815
do them or something like that.
Right. And that's, you know, it

407
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:42,944
just goes back to the,
you know, the organic.

408
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:50,265
nature of, of Virtual Coffee.
And if we were planning

409
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:54,315
this, I mean, you could
see like special interest

410
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:56,204
groups being a thing to plan.
, you know, if you're trying

411
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:57,795
to plan a group ahead
of time or a community.

412
00:19:57,914 --> 00:20:02,684
But I don't know.
It's, it's hard to imagine,

413
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:06,045
like trying to do all this
stuff, ahead of time or

414
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,045
whatever, you know what I mean?

415
00:20:06,134 --> 00:20:06,434
Bekah: Yeah.

416
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,420
Dan: Also, that's not
usually how my brain works

417
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,539
that well anyway, I, I mean
the, way that things have.

418
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,869
gone is What you know, is
obviously like it's more how

419
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:18,509
my brain works anyway, you
know, kind of like along with

420
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,670
things and trying to make
things better, but I don't know

421
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,970
it's well, it is what it is.
I don't know.

422
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:29,549
Bekah: Yeah.
I mean, I I'm like super proud

423
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:35,160
of us for early on getting a
lot of documentation because

424
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:36,809
that has helped to provide
a better space for people. Yeah.

425
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:42,000
I, I would.
like, I would like to do

426
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:44,369
a better job of onboarding
new community members. Yep.

427
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,769
And I feel like that, that
from the beginning, so I

428
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:49,380
feel like a lot of the, like,
would you do differently

429
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,670
are still things that like I
would like to do more of now?

430
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,240
Yeah, sure. Yeah.
Especially now that we have

431
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:00,180
new members coming in, it's
so great to see new faces

432
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,180
at Virtual Coffee again.

433
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:01,240
Dan: Absolutely.

434
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,259
Bekah: that's been a,
really bright side of

435
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:08,700
the last couple of weeks.
but, I just wanna make sure

436
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:08,700
that everybody's taken care of.

437
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,680
Dan: Yep. Yeah, I agree.
And that's like, you know, so

438
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:15,329
there's like technology stuff
that I, I just wanna change now.

439
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:18,210
It's it's not even, it's not
even like, a, oh, I wish we

440
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,390
had done this differently.
It's just, well, now we need it.

441
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,190
Like now we need things
like there's things

442
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,730
we need, you know?
So let's change them the the

443
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:30,720
new member thing, especially, is
especially cuz it's built like

444
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:32,220
originally around slack, Yeah.
And that's That sounds

445
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,750
Bekah: that maybe is something I
would change.

446
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:38,400
Dan: I don't know. Yeah. I.
mean, like Maybe, but like,

447
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:41,759
it was really before discord,
like took off, like took off

448
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:45,569
for people outside of gaming,
you know, mm-hmm  and I don't

449
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:48,079
know that there's any better
option and like created the

450
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:49,039
community, honestly, like it,
like, you know what I mean?

451
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,069
It's, I mean, the, zooms in
the slack, it's like, it's,

452
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:57,049
what was, it was the whole
thing for first, however long.

453
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:02,539
I don't know.
I dunno, whatever, however

454
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:07,630
many months or whatever it
was, you know, So, so yeah.

455
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,769
there's things that like, I'd
like to see improved and stuff,

456
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:12,920
but it's, I don't look at
them as, as, you know, regrets

457
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,970
or whatever, if that makes sense.

458
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:24,434
Bekah: Yeah. Let me, okay.
So the next question is what's

459
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:24,434
the hardest part of community

460
00:22:26,714 --> 00:22:29,295
Dan: of like running a community

461
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:33,345
Bekah: just of community.
So you can take it as you, as.

462
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:35,039
you. See fit.

463
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,029
Dan: I don't know, man.
I like, alright.

464
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:44,430
So for me, part of, as a member
of communities is just like,

465
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:51,000
it, it takes, like emotional
energy for me to engage with

466
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,099
things, engage with people
and do things or whatever.

467
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,190
And so sometimes I find
myself like just falling

468
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,944
out of communities or, or
just like not whatever.

469
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:01,595
And it even happens in
Virtual Coffee sometimes.

470
00:23:01,775 --> 00:23:07,204
I mean, you.
and I I mean, we talk all the

471
00:23:03,035 --> 00:23:10,505
time, like doing management
side, but like, I I'll

472
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:14,650
miss like coffees for weeks
because it's like eight 50

473
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:16,329
in the morning, you know?
And, and it's not, I'm

474
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:19,539
not tired or anything.
It's just like, I need, I

475
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:21,789
needed a certain amount of a
store of energy to be able to

476
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:22,869
like talk to people, you know,
especially people I don't know.

477
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,630
And I love it, but
like sometimes it's

478
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:30,644
sometimes it's hard. And so, I.
Yeah. although I will say, I

479
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,545
will say like every time
that I've felt that.

480
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:35,144
way, But then still gone.
I've been very glad that I went.

481
00:23:35,204 --> 00:23:37,625
Yeah. You know what I mean?
Like it's, it's one of

482
00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:39,224
those like Catch 22s where
my brain is like, fooling

483
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,224
me about it, you know?

484
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,285
Bekah: Yeah.

485
00:23:39,944 --> 00:23:41,714
Dan: But like overcoming that
that's, that can be hard.

486
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:45,545
And then another thing
for me is, my memory's

487
00:23:45,545 --> 00:23:47,674
really bad, especially
with like names and stuff

488
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:51,305
and like, and so, you know,
remembering people that I met

489
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:54,214
or like that I'm supposed to
know, or you know, I'll, I

490
00:23:54,214 --> 00:23:57,214
sensibly do know, but have
forgotten who they are or what

491
00:23:57,214 --> 00:23:59,555
their name is, or, you know,
that happens to me like a lot.

492
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:03,664
And it's much easier.
online Because you can kind

493
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:04,414
of like, look, try to Google
them or something, you know?

494
00:24:04,565 --> 00:24:07,535
Yeah. Harder in person.
Like it's more, more

495
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,484
embarrassing for me in person.
So it's, that's my other, yeah.

496
00:24:10,174 --> 00:24:15,025
Struggle. What about you?

497
00:24:15,184 --> 00:24:17,805
Bekah: I guess the, the thing
that I never would've thought

498
00:24:17,805 --> 00:24:22,875
about before this community was,
last year when Mike passed

499
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,505
away, that was like, obviously
a really hard experience.

500
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:30,765
He was an active
community member.

501
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:36,525
Like everybody loved him.
But then like

502
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:37,484
making decisions yeah.
About that. Yep.

503
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:43,355
And having to tell people
over and over, Yeah.

504
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:46,724
I, I like something that you
can't ever be prepared for.

505
00:24:46,724 --> 00:24:52,335
And so like experiencing the
losses of community members

506
00:24:53,204 --> 00:24:58,964
and with community members.
And like trying to leave

507
00:24:55,545 --> 00:25:01,234
space for people to experience
grief in different ways. Yeah.

508
00:25:01,244 --> 00:25:08,714
Is just, I, I don't know.
I felt like I was stretched

509
00:25:03,555 --> 00:25:10,914
beyond my limits of human being.
Like yeah.

510
00:25:11,115 --> 00:25:15,164
Went through and, and, you know,
it was hard with Mike, but like

511
00:25:15,164 --> 00:25:17,325
there have been other losses
in the communities, right?

512
00:25:17,325 --> 00:25:20,325
Like there have been
miscarriages, there

513
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:23,625
have been jobs lost.
There have been relationships.

514
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:29,894
that Are no longer.
And when people like confide

515
00:25:25,305 --> 00:25:34,305
in you and talk to you about
that, it's just one of those.

516
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:40,799
It is definitely the hardest
Emotional labor that, that

517
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:48,539
I have ever had to put in.
anywhere. It , it's like a

518
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:51,579
catch 22 though, right?
mm-hmm,  you have to experience.

519
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:58,470
like the, the full humanness
to really be close and

520
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,140
supportive to the, yeah.
the people around you.

521
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:06,029
So like, would I love to
not ever have to experience

522
00:26:06,035 --> 00:26:13,259
any of those things? Sure. Yeah.
I think it's a key part

523
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:16,890
of understanding the
people in front of us

524
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:17,400
to be there through it. So

525
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:21,720
Dan: No, I, I, I mean, I totally
agree and that's like, It

526
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,599
was, it was incredibly hard.
And, but I just, I was

527
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:30,990
like, while you were talking
just now, I was just like,

528
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:33,599
thinking of how, thankful
I am that like Virtual

529
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:37,109
Coffee is, is what it is.
And like it's a place where

530
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:40,680
people can come to share
this horrible, thing, like

531
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:46,230
the heavy feelings or, you
know, it's obviously is

532
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:52,349
hard, but I think like my,
I guess my point is just

533
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:54,569
like, that It's worth it.
I guess is my point.

534
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:59,505
You know what I mean?
Like the, like, it is

535
00:26:55,049 --> 00:27:02,025
like it, it it's yeah.
It's that it's, it's just, it's

536
00:26:59,775 --> 00:27:05,025
hard, but like, it's also like,
it's what makes Virtual Coffee,

537
00:27:02,025 --> 00:27:09,974
like what it is, you know?
I mean, the that's, that's

538
00:27:05,085 --> 00:27:12,315
sort of like connection.
The, you know, the,

539
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:17,930
intimate connection right.
Is, is I started noticing it

540
00:27:12,315 --> 00:27:20,869
even before, maybe right around
like our, our like original

541
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:23,299
Hacktoberfest time, you know,
like when we all started like

542
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:27,500
really doing that, but like just
the, I this is gonna like sound,

543
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:30,049
it might sound like silly, but
like the fact that like, people

544
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,039
would just like throw around
the heart emoji, you know?

545
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:34,240
And like, just to people, you
know, like not, not your best

546
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,369
friends or not, but just like
people like in the community,

547
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:38,440
you know, made me feel good.
I don't, I don't know why.

548
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:44,019
Like, and, and, and to be
able to also like also start

549
00:27:44,025 --> 00:27:45,789
throwing around the heart
emoji, or whatever, you

550
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,710
know, like, I it's like a,
it's like kind of a silly

551
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:52,329
way to say it, but like, to.
to both, share, you

552
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:54,009
know, I guess sharing. it, Right.
Like both like two ways. Right.

553
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:56,259
You know, there's like,
there's, there's, good

554
00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:01,690
feelings coming, both ways.
And I, from everybody

555
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:04,089
in the community and
like, I dunno, this it's good.

556
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,200
Bekah: Yeah.
I think when you can share

557
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:12,269
your losses openly like that,
then you celebrate your wins.

558
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:12,359
Dan: Right.

559
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,269
Bekah: You know, just as
strongly in the other direction.

560
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,289
So it. it is Definitely one of
the hardest, but one of the

561
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,130
most rewarding to be able to
know that there are people

562
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,009
out there that trust you to
share that information, that

563
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,990
you know, that if you're
going to be going through

564
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,259
something hard, that there
are gonna be people there too.

565
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,174
And I know my empathy and
understanding of other people

566
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:38,204
has definitely, I feel like,
like the Grinch, right?

567
00:28:38,204 --> 00:28:43,335
Like  yeah.
I was a little bit of the

568
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:43,335
Grinch before Virtual Coffee.

569
00:28:44,444 --> 00:28:48,750
Dan: three sizes. Yeah.
No, that's a great call

570
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:51,690
and that's a good point.
Like, I mean, I have learned

571
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:55,470
so much just about like yeah.
Expressing myself and talking to

572
00:28:51,690 --> 00:29:01,019
connecting with people and,
yeah, my, I was gonna say like

573
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:02,940
my, my like emotional literacy,
I feel like has exploded

574
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:08,491
over the last few years.
It, it reminds me of,

575
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:11,255
I forget what we were
talking about, but I was

576
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:14,914
talking with somebody and I
was, I was like, they were

577
00:29:11,255 --> 00:29:16,775
like, this was earlier in.
pandemic When things were

578
00:29:14,914 --> 00:29:18,095
like, still like a lot
more shut down, you know?

579
00:29:18,095 --> 00:29:20,464
And they were talking about
how they hadn't like, they

580
00:29:20,464 --> 00:29:22,115
hadn't like many new people
or they haven't talked, you

581
00:29:22,115 --> 00:29:25,595
know, like all this stuff.
And I'm like, I've actually

582
00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:28,069
like made more friends. Yeah.
I mean, it's because of Virtual

583
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:30,900
Coffee started or once Virtual
Coffee started, but like made

584
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:34,140
more friends, new friends in
that time, in the last three

585
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:36,359
years than I had in the last
10 years before that I think,

586
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:39,539
you know, like put together,
and like, and like good

587
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,369
friends, not, you know,
not just like random Twitter

588
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:42,210
followers or something,
you know, you know what I. mean?

589
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:46,529
Like, and, and yeah, I
mean, it's all, that's all

590
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:49,470
Virtual Coffee, you know, it's,
it's just like, you know, it's

591
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:49,650
good stuff.

592
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:54,674
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah.
And it's we get to

593
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:56,234
meet up some of us. I know.
Well, this is, which

594
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:56,234
is really, really nice.

595
00:29:56,234 --> 00:29:59,204
Dan: Yeah.
This is the second time that

596
00:29:56,355 --> 00:30:01,875
Bekah and I have met in person.
cuz And when, when did we meet?

597
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,434
When did, when did we like
start working together

598
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:10,134
Bekah: is 20 July of 2018.
18, 18, I think. Okay. Yeah.

599
00:30:10,994 --> 00:30:16,184
Dan: So yeah, two times
every What year is it now?

600
00:30:16,964 --> 00:30:21,224
22 So two times.
Every three years. See each other

601
00:30:21,224 --> 00:30:24,289
Bekah: in Yeah, right. Yeah.
And we're in Kansas city. So

602
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,019
Dan: we're in Kansas
city right now.

603
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:27,000
Bekah: We live like two
hours from each other,

604
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,150
but this is the only place
that would take us really.

605
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,849
So, yeah. Yeah.
I guess that's understandable.

606
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,099
All right.
Let's see what other questions.

607
00:30:38,105 --> 00:30:40,710
time over. We still got, oh,
we got some time

608
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,609
Dan: 20 minutes-ish
before hours up. I dunno.

609
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,190
Oh, Okay.
I suppose we should have

610
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,410
said something on slack about
how we aren't going live

611
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:52,059
Bekah: I did.

612
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:52,769
Dan: Oh, good job.

613
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:53,279
Bekah: Don't worry.

614
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:54,359
Dan: Did you do
it on Twitter too?

615
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,359
Bekah: I didn't
on Twitter though. Sorry.

616
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:05,369
Can't cover all the spaces.
Oh, what did you do? Did it.

617
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:05,640
pause

618
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:10,650
Dan: it?
I don't know if it did for that

619
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:11,759
moment, but it is going again.
So we're in good shape.

620
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,119
The recording of the
technical issues.

621
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:16,559
We've been recording for

622
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,960
Bekah: like half an hour. You
need to sit, be

623
00:31:17,255 --> 00:31:19,529
closer to your mic.
Cause I can't hear

624
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:22,845
Dan: Has that been true
the full time or just now?

625
00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:24,855
Bekah: Since I got up,
it was like, just

626
00:31:23,505 --> 00:31:25,845
since you got up. Okay. Good.
All right.

627
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:27,555
Where are the questions?
I don't know.

628
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:29,384
There was another one. and,

629
00:31:29,835 --> 00:31:31,664
Dan: Oh, Ayu
had a question that was,

630
00:31:29,894 --> 00:31:31,664
I know it was a trap.

631
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:33,555
Bekah: It was a trap.

632
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:33,855
Dan: Yeah, for me

633
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:37,065
Bekah: it was a trap for. you.
Okay, wait, let me,

634
00:31:39,345 --> 00:31:41,384
Dan: I think it was on Twitter,

635
00:31:42,674 --> 00:31:45,585
Bekah: Thanks.
Barrett Blake for saying

636
00:31:43,664 --> 00:31:47,234
the Virtual Coffee
podcast is a must. Listen.

637
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:49,170
Dan: Yes. Thank you.

638
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,000
Bekah: We love it.

639
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,079
Dan: we love it.

640
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,329
Bekah: Why can't I find it?
Okay.

641
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:59,890
Maybe it's the history of how
Virtual Coffee was founded.

642
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,900
Oh yes. Yes.

643
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:01,619
Dan: See,

644
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:03,240
Bekah: go. ahead.

645
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:04,890
Dan: What I didn't found it.

646
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:10,829
Bekah: Well, you fired me and

647
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,601
Dan: see, Ayu
is just . This is this is it.

648
00:32:13,605 --> 00:32:20,055
Every, starts like
that, I didn't fire you. Yeah.

649
00:32:20,234 --> 00:32:21,194
You heard it here, folks.

650
00:32:22,424 --> 00:32:27,404
Bekah: Dan said, I will no
longer pay you to do work. Yes.

651
00:32:27,704 --> 00:32:32,015
So you all are welcome to
define that as you see.

652
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:37,454
fit, We should, have them
vote for their favorite Virtual

653
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:39,194
Coffee host and see who wins.

654
00:32:40,484 --> 00:32:41,934
Dan: That doesn't sound very fun
for me.

655
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:44,970
Bekah: I mean, you,
you're probably lot

656
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:45,839
of people's favorites.

657
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:50,579
Dan: Mm-hmm I doubt it.
it'll probably be like,

658
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,670
just one of our guests. win

659
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,000
Bekah: One of our Kirk Kirk
is gonna be the one that win.

660
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,410
Dan: It would be, he would
get my vote, honestly.

661
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:57,240
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah.
I vote for Kirk too.

662
00:32:57,329 --> 00:32:58,410
Everybody vote for Kirk.

663
00:32:58,414 --> 00:33:01,799
Dan: All right.
It is decided Kirk's favorite.

664
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,230
Oh, I mean, should we
like finish the story if

665
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,250
people haven't heard this?

666
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,440
Bekah: I guess so. Okay.
So, Dan and I work together.

667
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,880
Dan: And then the shutdown
happened and all of my clients

668
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,700
stopped giving me work.
And so I had to stop

669
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:22,319
giving Bekah work and then
something, ended. I dunno.

670
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,900
Bekah: Yeah.
Well the, the day that I

671
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,839
went and picked up my kids'
schoolwork, cuz they said,

672
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:29,160
oh, you're going home.
They're going home

673
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,720
for three weeks. Which they never
went back that year. Yeah.

674
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,359
Dan was like, Hey, wanna
catch up  and I was like, oh no.

675
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:43,454
And it was, oh no.
So when Dan hired me right

676
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:45,375
outta bootcamp, I hadn't had,
we didn't do an interview.

677
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:48,075
Like we just had a conversation.
Yeah.

678
00:33:48,285 --> 00:33:52,125
And so I was now interviewing
for the first time, really

679
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:55,305
ever with four kids at
home that were trying to

680
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:58,545
be doing school at home.
And it was just miserable.

681
00:33:58,575 --> 00:34:01,575
Like the interview
process is so crushing

682
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:05,684
and I just found myself.
I was like crying all

683
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:07,065
the time every night,
I'm like this is awful.

684
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:12,480
And so I finally like
remembered like everything I

685
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,190
had gone through in trauma.
And I was like, I.

686
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,760
know You shouldn't be alone
and isolated in your feelings.

687
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,530
Does anybody wanna meet
up for Virtual Coffee?

688
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,505
And then people did.
So I was doing it like one

689
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:28,125
day a week, and then it
was at east coast time.

690
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:30,465
And then people were like,
what about west coast time?

691
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:32,474
So then I added, I was like
doing double sessions at

692
00:34:32,474 --> 00:34:36,405
one point, like Fridays.
I was doing in the morning

693
00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:38,715
taking a break for an
hour or two and then

694
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:41,925
doing in the afternoon.
And it was, it was not

695
00:34:38,985 --> 00:34:43,425
like I'm an introvert.
I, I say I'm an introvert.

696
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,905
But I like by that, I was
like, I don't, I enjoyed

697
00:34:46,905 --> 00:34:49,664
it, but I didn't like wanna
people anymore for like

698
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:54,900
the rest of the weekend.
That was just too but

699
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:57,719
then we just kept going and
like, people were like, Hey,

700
00:34:54,900 --> 00:35:01,199
why don't you have a slack?
And so I think Bryan, initially

701
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:04,829
he was like, here's a slack.
Okay. And then he was like,

702
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:09,210
let's do lunch and learns. Okay.
Then we did a newsletter

703
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:10,199
and then I've always
wanted a podcast.

704
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,599
And Cameron, I think
was like, when are we

705
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:15,929
gonna do the podcast?
And you were like,

706
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:19,590
let's do a podcast.
So we just kept going with it.

707
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,340
Yep. And Dan, Dan did
hire me for a while.

708
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:23,699
Dan: Yeah.

709
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:24,690
Bekah: So

710
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,949
Dan: as soon as I was able to, I
, Bekah: he only fired Oh my God,

711
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:32,190
I didn't fire you. That's
not the right word.

712
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,769
You're using the
word incorrectly. I feel like,

713
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:35,710
Bekah: oh, what
is the definition?

714
00:35:36,914 --> 00:35:38,925
Dan: I feel like if you're
gonna fire somebody, it has to

715
00:35:38,925 --> 00:35:45,074
be for like, a reason, Like a
it's laid off is maybe what?

716
00:35:45,585 --> 00:35:47,864
probably doesn't really apply
to contractors, but like

717
00:35:48,644 --> 00:35:52,844
that's closer to what it is.
Right. Laid off means the company

718
00:35:50,204 --> 00:35:53,625
has to stop, you know,
can't pay you anymore.

719
00:35:53,894 --> 00:35:55,875
Bekah: However. you wanna justify
it in your head Dan.

720
00:35:55,994 --> 00:36:03,855
Dan: Oh God Whatever.
You better watch or you

721
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,385
were gonna get fired again. cuz.

722
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,070
Bekah: you can't fire me.
I don't work for you anymore.

723
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,219
Dan: I Definitely can and I will.

724
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,070
Bekah: You can't fire
me if I don't work for you,

725
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,380
Dan: you can't tell me,
don't tell me my truth. Okay.

726
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:22,409
Bekah: all right.
You go ahead and you try and

727
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,769
fire me and see how that goes.
Are you, are you firing me

728
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,489
as part of the pod as your
podcast co.

729
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:32,324
Dan: No, I don't think a
lot of people tune into

730
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:35,925
the just Dan podcast.
Dan talks to himself podcast.

731
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:38,684
Bekah: I would tune
into Dan talk to himself podcast.

732
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:41,114
Dan: Yeah, but you
just heckle me. So

733
00:36:41,804 --> 00:36:44,025
Bekah: yeah, I would
probably heckle you. Yeah.

734
00:36:44,655 --> 00:36:46,485
Well, tomorrow when I
speak at PubConf, you're

735
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:47,385
allowed to heckle me though.

736
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:48,135
Dan: Yes,

737
00:36:48,614 --> 00:36:49,695
Bekah: please heckle

738
00:36:50,804 --> 00:37:00,554
Dan: I, yes, I will. All right.
I, are you glad or sad

739
00:36:56,364 --> 00:37:02,474
that I didn't say yell.
"wuddup Bek" at the

740
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:03,914
beginning of your talk
this morning, I thought.

741
00:37:03,914 --> 00:37:04,184
about it.

742
00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:10,724
Bekah: I, I, I think I'm
glad that you did not do that.

743
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,565
Dan: All right.
I made the right choice.

744
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:13,695
Bekah: I was already
super nervous. that's And then I,

745
00:37:13,784 --> 00:37:15,045
Dan: that's why I didn't do
it, you know, I didn't wanna,

746
00:37:15,045 --> 00:37:18,360
Bekah: would've been very,
I'm not really sure how, what

747
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:18,989
would have happened.

748
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:21,119
Dan: Yeah.
I, just like, well, I mean, I

749
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:25,110
figured you would just break
into a laughing thing where you

750
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,630
couldn't stop laughing and which
would've been entertaining for

751
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,630
me, but probably not for you.

752
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:28,150
Bekah: No,

753
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:30,719
Dan: that's the way I made.
the right choice. And then I

754
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,889
Bekah: would've
just hidden a hole.

755
00:37:31,894 --> 00:37:32,550
Dan: Just wanted, do you know?

756
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,369
Bekah: I would've just like
stood behind the screen and then.

757
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:37,949
Dan: I considered it
and then chose not to. And, you

758
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:38,489
Bekah: know, thank you.

759
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:39,030
Dan: Yeah.

760
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:40,889
Bekah: Thanks for being there.

761
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:43,949
Dan: Yeah. I feel like 10 years
ago me would've done it.

762
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:45,960
And then, I mean, and then
realized it was a bad idea

763
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,500
after, you know, but like,
like wouldn't have put

764
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,469
it together beforehand.
You know, that, that was a bad

765
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:52,679
idea.

766
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:54,900
Bekah: I feel like that
my brothers definitely

767
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,469
would have done. that.
That's what I'm saying. Yeah.

768
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,789
All right. We have more questions

769
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:00,489
Dan: learning. We do?

770
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,730
Bekah: What does
community mean to you?

771
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,494
Dan: Community? I don't know.

772
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,735
Bekah: I think community
is a group, a group of

773
00:38:12,735 --> 00:38:15,554
people that have some
shared sense of belonging

774
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:17,985
and there can be different
degrees of that, right?

775
00:38:17,985 --> 00:38:21,195
Like you, you all might like
to go hiking and that can be a

776
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:25,335
sense of community, or it can
be people that are, you know, I.

777
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:30,510
love true crime podcasts.
So, and actually my favorite

778
00:38:27,284 --> 00:38:32,309
podcasters, true crime
podcasters live in Kansas city.

779
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:35,460
Whoa. So I like thought about
trying to get them to come.

780
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,650
Like, can you come be part
of our life podcast, but I

781
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,110
wasn't sure how we were gonna
talk about murder and Virtual

782
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:45,000
Coffee at the same time.
Although I have some,

783
00:38:41,909 --> 00:38:45,840
no, I'm not gonna take
you down that tangent.

784
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:51,539
Oh, No, Sorry.
So yeah, so some sense

785
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:53,820
of belonging and then there's
different degrees and ways.

786
00:38:55,664 --> 00:38:56,835
Expressing that

787
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,724
Dan: sense of belonging.
Yeah, I think that's great. Yeah.

788
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:01,304
And the other word that I
would use is connection, right?

789
00:39:01,335 --> 00:39:02,985
Yeah. Is like belonging
and connection.

790
00:39:02,985 --> 00:39:05,925
And maybe those maybe
you can't feel belonging

791
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:09,690
without connection.
I don't know  but like, you

792
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:14,280
know, the, the that's the
other side of it is, is the, is

793
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:14,940
connecting with people, right?
Like, okay.

794
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:21,300
So like I'm a guardians
fan, you know, and I.

795
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,769
don't know, We were talking
about this last night,

796
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:24,150
which which is why it's
in my head, but like, you

797
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,860
know, your regional sports
team, lots of times, you're

798
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:30,030
a fan of or whatever.
And you like some, some sense

799
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:32,500
of belonging from that, right?
It's like whatever

800
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,489
you have the hat or
whatever, you know?

801
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:36,010
Bekah: Yeah.
When I was in the airport,

802
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,239
there was somebody wearing WVU
tennis shoes in front of me.

803
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:41,860
And like, I graduated from WVU.
I taught there and it

804
00:39:39,014 --> 00:39:43,780
was like, oh, like that
guy's my friend, I don't

805
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,440
know that guy.

806
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:48,159
Dan: Right. Right.
And You might connect like yeah.

807
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:49,719
And that like creates
a connect, you know?

808
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,329
And it creates a connection.
I mean, you were the

809
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:52,960
only one cuz you didn't
probably say

810
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,030
Bekah: yeah, no, I thought about
saying, let's go mountaineers,

811
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,980
but then I got a little
embarrassed, so I didn't,

812
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,119
that's probably the right call.
So

813
00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:03,675
Dan: yeah, my mom does stuff
like that, you I would like

814
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:06,735
the like, with, with the
Ohio state people, you know?

815
00:40:06,914 --> 00:40:07,364
Bekah: Yeah.

816
00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:09,195
Dan: It's not, it's
never fun for me anyway.

817
00:40:10,815 --> 00:40:14,414
but yeah, I mean
that, that's it. like, right.

818
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,485
The Belonging is a great, like,
I think that's a great, I think

819
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:19,545
that's like the, the, the real
key, you know, and then, yeah.

820
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,824
And then that sense of
connection is, also, so

821
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:25,005
Bekah: I was getting off
the escalator here earlier.

822
00:40:25,065 --> 00:40:27,945
And some guy was waving and I
thought he was waving at me.

823
00:40:27,974 --> 00:40:31,965
And then Way back wholeheartedly
Adam was like, was actually

824
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:35,894
waving at the guy behind me.
Yeah. Then I didn't feel

825
00:40:33,795 --> 00:40:37,275
like I belonged.
I felt very embarrassed for

826
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,695
myself.

827
00:40:38,204 --> 00:40:40,784
Dan: You were not in his
community of, of waving people.

828
00:40:40,994 --> 00:40:43,184
Bekah: I, I was not, not part of.
that.

829
00:40:43,635 --> 00:40:46,664
Dan: I it happens to me.
Like once a year, I'd

830
00:40:44,324 --> 00:40:49,755
say really bad, you know?
Like, just like Yeah. Yeah.

831
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:53,295
There's a lot of people here, so
it's, it's easy to,

832
00:40:53,295 --> 00:40:57,855
Bekah: yeah. I hope he forgets
my Let's see here. Okay.

833
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,264
Here's another question.
That's my face.

834
00:41:00,284 --> 00:41:03,675
At in-person events,
what are some techniques or

835
00:41:03,675 --> 00:41:07,635
tactics you used for starting
a conversation with a stranger?

836
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:11,235
I, I am like terrified of
talking with strangers and I'm

837
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,704
on booth duty while I'm here
for, work at DeepGram.

838
00:41:14,804 --> 00:41:14,864
Dan: Yeah.

839
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:16,875
Bekah: And I guess it
almost makes it a little

840
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:19,195
bit easier cuz I'm like,
I'm deep part of DeepGram.

841
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:23,085
We're a speech text API company.
So at least like I

842
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:28,215
can do the spiel.
but sometimes I don't, I told

843
00:41:24,344 --> 00:41:28,215
a woman, I liked her glasses.

844
00:41:29,545 --> 00:41:30,364
Dan: what's wrong with that?

845
00:41:30,644 --> 00:41:32,534
Bekah: No, that's how I
get to talk to people.

846
00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:33,164
Dan: Oh, sure. Yeah. Oh yeah.

847
00:41:33,164 --> 00:41:34,125
Bekah: Give them a compliment.

848
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,735
Dan: Sure. Yeah. Yeah.
But I would say only

849
00:41:35,295 --> 00:41:38,835
compliment yeah. clothes and
stuff, right?

850
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:40,724
Bekah: Yeah.
You have to be careful with what

851
00:41:41,175 --> 00:41:42,585
Dan: especially if
you're not a woman, if

852
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:43,394
you're not a woman.

853
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,005
Bekah: Yeah.
Don't be like, it's just like,

854
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:47,985
don't you have really nice
eyes  no, yeah, that will get

855
00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:48,494
creepy. That's

856
00:41:48,795 --> 00:41:52,155
Dan: okay.
yeah, no, I don't have

857
00:41:50,025 --> 00:41:52,994
any good strategies cause
I'm really bad at it.

858
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,349
I'd say one, one stretch.

859
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:57,630
Bekah: you talk
to people at the table lunch

860
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:57,929
table.

861
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:05,639
Dan: sure. Sort of, yeah.
I mean, they were talking

862
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:08,369
to me . What I was gonna
say was, if you go with

863
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:10,469
a friend, you know, yeah.
It's much easier to actually

864
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,539
talk to other people.
If you already have somebody

865
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:15,840
that you're like with that
you do know, because like we

866
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:17,670
sat Bekah and I sat next to
each other at the lunch table

867
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,420
and then like other people
just sat down, you know?

868
00:42:18,425 --> 00:42:21,329
And we weren't
like, I don't know.

869
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,019
We just like started
chatting, you know?

870
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:26,190
And, and that's cool.
It's again also hard for me.

871
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:27,269
I'm not, I'm not good at it.

872
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:27,719
Bekah: Yeah.

873
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,405
Dan: They're at this
conference they're doing,

874
00:42:30,405 --> 00:42:33,405
like a Bingo thing where
they're trying to get you to

875
00:42:33,405 --> 00:42:36,224
go to all the speaker table
or the sponsor booths, you

876
00:42:36,224 --> 00:42:39,704
can see somebody's behind us.
And, so you have like

877
00:42:37,335 --> 00:42:41,324
this little card and you get
little stamps, you know, and

878
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:44,775
if you get 'em all, you get
entered in something raffle

879
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:44,775
for, I don't know what,

880
00:42:44,835 --> 00:42:45,255
Bekah: yeah, I don't know.

881
00:42:45,284 --> 00:42:47,614
Dan: But, anyway, so
now I'm going to all these

882
00:42:47,614 --> 00:42:50,085
booths that I don't have any
interest in going to and trying

883
00:42:50,085 --> 00:42:55,664
to like make conversations.
Like I feel bad just

884
00:42:52,094 --> 00:42:56,175
being like stamp my thing.
Okay, bye.

885
00:42:56,204 --> 00:42:59,295
You know, and so I'm always
so what do you guys. do?

886
00:42:59,804 --> 00:43:01,605
Bekah: Yeah.
Yeah, we got a lot of

887
00:43:00,105 --> 00:43:02,474
that our you're like,
I'm like, it's okay.

888
00:43:02,474 --> 00:43:04,034
You don't have to talk to
me if you don't want to.

889
00:43:04,034 --> 00:43:05,355
Dan: with the people was
like, have you heard of us?

890
00:43:05,355 --> 00:43:10,065
I'm like, no, I haven't, I,

891
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:10,815
Bekah: that's awkward.

892
00:43:10,994 --> 00:43:13,769
Dan: And like also I'm not
looking for a job and that's

893
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:15,630
one of the, like a lot of
these people are here to hire,

894
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:21,659
which makes a lot of sense.
But like, I probably

895
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:23,909
wouldn't, I don't know if
this is a common thing to

896
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:25,380
like, get your thing stamped
at every booth thing.

897
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:28,860
But like, I imagine that a lot
of these booths are used to

898
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,510
the people that come up are
the people that are looking for

899
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,429
jobs, because that's the reason
they're they're here, you know?

900
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:37,829
And I'm like, no, I don't.
They're like, whoa, we have some

901
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,614
positions available in front end
and I'm like, yeah, I'm good.

902
00:43:41,324 --> 00:43:42,525
you know, like, I
don't know what to say.

903
00:43:42,974 --> 00:43:47,565
I don't, I'm like I don't
have the, I dunno, I could

904
00:43:47,565 --> 00:43:51,764
feel like a lot of people
are just good saying things

905
00:43:51,824 --> 00:43:54,135
in ways that make sense to.
people.

906
00:43:55,005 --> 00:43:56,684
Bekah: My dad, like loves
talking to strangers.

907
00:43:56,715 --> 00:43:58,695
I talked to a stranger in the
airport and I texted him like,

908
00:43:58,695 --> 00:44:02,775
dad, you'll be so proud of me.
This, this guy used

909
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:04,815
to live in Pittsburgh. Now.
He lives in Atlanta and

910
00:44:02,954 --> 00:44:07,244
he's been there for 10
years and I had that whole

911
00:44:04,815 --> 00:44:07,844
conversation all by myself.
That's impressive. Yeah.

912
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,614
And he was like,
isn't that amazing?

913
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:11,954
And I was like, no, dad,
it's not, I don't wanna

914
00:44:11,954 --> 00:44:15,255
do that all the time.
I mean, the guy was really

915
00:44:13,005 --> 00:44:17,355
nice and, and I would've had
a more conversation with him,

916
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,059
Dan: no, I I didn't.

917
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:21,030
Bekah: hear, I think like
getting involved too, like if

918
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:24,329
you're a speaker, then people.
will talk to you.

919
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,550
So that's a good way to do it.

920
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:31,559
Dan: Yeah. I mean like, yeah.
And that's, I'd say the

921
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:33,809
other times that I've
had fun at conferences.

922
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:37,019
I've been with the speakers.
Not because I was a speaker

923
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:39,059
necessarily, but like
I just either knew the

924
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:39,059
organizers or whatever.

925
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:39,119
Bekah: Yeah.

926
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,489
Dan: And like, or just, there
there was one event in Florida

927
00:44:41,489 --> 00:44:44,534
that I went to where they just
had their after party, whatever.

928
00:44:44,534 --> 00:44:47,414
And all of course, all the
speakers were there and I, I

929
00:44:47,414 --> 00:44:51,224
just kind of like tagged along.
You. know, and ended up

930
00:44:48,675 --> 00:44:53,684
at a smaller thing.
And that's like, for me, I,

931
00:44:51,525 --> 00:44:57,195
I always, I do much better
in smaller like settings,

932
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:58,215
you know, like, smaller
groups of people or whatever.

933
00:44:58,215 --> 00:45:03,295
And so, yeah, I'd say,
you know, to go back to the

934
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,045
original question, right?
Your strategies for

935
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:07,275
this sort of thing. Yeah.
My main strategy is bring

936
00:45:08,114 --> 00:45:09,284
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah.
It is really good.

937
00:45:09,284 --> 00:45:13,184
Last year at KC C James quick
was here and I just like

938
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:15,735
followed him around everywhere's

939
00:45:16,094 --> 00:45:18,585
Dan: That's
what I told Bekah I was gonna

940
00:45:16,275 --> 00:45:20,025
do Bekah except that she's.
just sitting in this

941
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,045
booth the whole time.
and that's less fun.

942
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:21,784
Bekah: Not the whole time.

943
00:45:22,085 --> 00:45:22,664
Dan: No, not the, whole time.

944
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:25,155
Bekah: some of the time.
I'm not obviously now,

945
00:45:23,204 --> 00:45:25,155
my podcasting right here,

946
00:45:25,695 --> 00:45:26,204
Dan: which is cool.

947
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:27,855
Bekah: I gotta go back to
the booth after this though.

948
00:45:28,605 --> 00:45:31,545
But then tomorrow I'm
free in the afternoon.

949
00:45:31,574 --> 00:45:33,454
Dan: Yeah.

950
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:38,280
Bekah: Yeah.
So, I would say bringing

951
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,949
a friend is nice and it, or
it doesn't even have to be

952
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,409
like a friend friend, just
put it out there on Twitter

953
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,820
or whatever, social media
like, Hey, is anybody going?

954
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,690
Want to meet up?

955
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:50,639
Dan: Yeah. Yep.
That's another

956
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:54,150
good strategy as well.
Yeah, I did the same thing.

957
00:45:54,179 --> 00:45:56,969
Yeah.
With Rizél was trying to get

958
00:45:55,019 --> 00:46:00,000
her to come find us as lunch
cuz she was, yeah, she was at

959
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,869
your talk and I didn't know that
I missed her, but

960
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,389
Bekah: it is hard when
you're by yourself.

961
00:46:03,449 --> 00:46:05,070
I, I mean, I've been to
conferences that were

962
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:09,809
terrible experiences.
Because like there one, I

963
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,039
can't remember which one it
was within the last year.

964
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,079
Like I would go sit down at
the lunch table and people

965
00:46:13,085 --> 00:46:15,179
would just like stand up and
walk away and then I'd just

966
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:18,960
be sitting there by myself. Yeah.
I'm like. oh, all right.

967
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,090
I'm just gonna
continue to sit here. Yeah.

968
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:21,739
By myself.

969
00:46:21,769 --> 00:46:24,570
Dan: Yeah.
Yeah, no, I, when I'm, when I

970
00:46:22,065 --> 00:46:27,780
I've, I think I've only gone
to one, like being conferenced

971
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,710
by myself and I just turned
into like a Mo person.

972
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:31,199
Like, I honestly like put my
headphones on I read my book,

973
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:33,719
or something, you know, put
my, like open my computer.

974
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:38,010
I, I'm not good at it.
That's why it's nice

975
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,010
to have a friend.

976
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:40,619
Bekah: You know, The
other thing would be, talk

977
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:44,639
to speakers, you know? Yeah.
So if you are there by yourself,

978
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:47,909
then go up to the speaker.
and Talk or like are,

979
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:50,070
are badges say if we're
speakers or, or not.

980
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:53,730
And what company? Oh, mine.
Doesn't say what

981
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:56,670
company I'm with.
Maybe cuz I'm a speaker.

982
00:46:56,699 --> 00:47:00,929
I'm not really sure does yours?
No, no. Yours says attendee.

983
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,050
Well you can just go up
to and be like, so I see

984
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:05,099
you're an attendee too.

985
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:09,300
Dan: yeah.
That's the kind of thing

986
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:11,730
that I imagine saying.
And then, you know,

987
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,090
realize it's a bad idea.
and then, you

988
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:13,769
Bekah: know, Jokes
are a good way.

989
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:16,079
Just go up to so many random.
and Tell them a joke.

990
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:17,280
I think that's a good idea.

991
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:23,280
Dan: I, my, my,
father-in-law is the same

992
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,349
way I think is your Dad but,
and he'll do the same thing.

993
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:27,449
He'll do drop a joke or
like just random, you know,

994
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:32,639
thing, or make a comment.
And like one time he, one

995
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:36,000
time he was, this is on, we
were on vacation, heard a

996
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:38,639
lady talking to her friend
at the grocery store and was

997
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:40,769
like, she was telling some
it wasn't like a Personal.

998
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:42,449
It was a personal story,
but not like a, not like

999
00:47:42,449 --> 00:47:48,795
a, you know, private story. Yeah.
But like, and saw her at some

1000
00:47:44,534 --> 00:47:50,175
other store like later and was
like, Hey, how about that thing?

1001
00:47:50,175 --> 00:47:50,744
You Think, you know,

1002
00:47:50,925 --> 00:47:51,585
Bekah: oh, that's creepy.

1003
00:47:52,344 --> 00:47:53,925
Dan: I know. I'm like, that's
a horrible idea.

1004
00:47:54,224 --> 00:47:56,905
And he's like, yeah.
And she, she acted kind

1005
00:47:55,034 --> 00:47:59,715
of weird about that.
I'm like, yeah, no kidding, man.

1006
00:48:01,994 --> 00:48:04,275
So, don't do that. No. Yeah.

1007
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:08,505
Bekah: That's why. I.
Bolt my door shut in

1008
00:48:06,105 --> 00:48:09,795
the hotel and stack up
furniture against the door.

1009
00:48:09,795 --> 00:48:12,045
Dan: And he's not creepy.
That's the, that's the

1010
00:48:10,635 --> 00:48:14,744
thing, you know, he's
just like, he thought it

1011
00:48:12,045 --> 00:48:19,695
would be funny, you know?
And, it wasn't, that's not,

1012
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:20,094
he didn't keep following her. So

1013
00:48:21,644 --> 00:48:23,804
Bekah: sorry again, a year
later and brought it up again,

1014
00:48:24,755 --> 00:48:25,784
Dan: right?
Showed up at her house.

1015
00:48:26,835 --> 00:48:31,815
Anyway, sorry, Phil.
. I love you.

1016
00:48:32,985 --> 00:48:33,764
Bekah: Um,

1017
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:36,179
Dan: Do we have
any more questions?

1018
00:48:36,269 --> 00:48:39,989
Bekah: Okay.
Travis followed up, but I

1019
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:42,809
always like slapping language
and framework stickers on

1020
00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:45,179
things, but they seem better
for keeping the conversation

1021
00:48:42,809 --> 00:48:48,389
going than starting it. Yeah.
That can be a good way to do it.

1022
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:48,690
Dan: What?

1023
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:54,210
Bekah: Like language or
framework stickers, like talking

1024
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:58,619
about those things that you
do, as a conversation starter,

1025
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,539
like if my water bottle had. a,

1026
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:01,239
Dan: Oh,

1027
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:05,219
Bekah: React sticker on it.
Talk to me about, oh,

1028
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:07,769
you know, React too. Hey, okay.
Okay. Yeah, that's cool.

1029
00:49:08,429 --> 00:49:12,554
Dan: Yeah, I, yeah,
that's a good idea.

1030
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:19,905
I was, I started talking
about Tailwind to one of the

1031
00:49:19,905 --> 00:49:21,735
sponsor booths that I was
having random conversations

1032
00:49:21,735 --> 00:49:25,574
with and, I'm pretty sure
I bored them cause I like saw

1033
00:49:25,574 --> 00:49:28,394
their eyes crossing, not bored
them, but like I went off on a

1034
00:49:28,394 --> 00:49:31,425
Tailwind tangent And they were
not interested in that content.

1035
00:49:33,195 --> 00:49:35,235
Bekah: you can also go up
to each of the booths and

1036
00:49:35,235 --> 00:49:37,155
practice a different accent

1037
00:49:37,605 --> 00:49:37,695
Dan: Ooh.

1038
00:49:38,284 --> 00:49:40,304
Bekah: So try the
same conversation.

1039
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:40,824
Dan: Oh ja.

1040
00:49:40,905 --> 00:49:43,094
Bekah: In a different
accent every time.

1041
00:49:43,755 --> 00:49:45,284
Dan: how many accents?
What, accent do you got?

1042
00:49:45,284 --> 00:49:46,244
What's your, oh,

1043
00:49:46,244 --> 00:49:48,315
Bekah: I don't do, I
can't do any accents.

1044
00:49:48,324 --> 00:49:50,954
Dan: You can't Do any accents?
No, You can't do a German accent.

1045
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:54,525
No. what about,

1046
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:58,244
Bekah: Ambrose is really good.
He's been practicing his British.

1047
00:49:58,244 --> 00:49:58,724
accent

1048
00:49:59,105 --> 00:50:02,644
Dan: At the,
get to the chopper, you know,

1049
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:03,914
we need to do the, we need to
add the react to the remix.

1050
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,170
Bekah: I'm not,
I'm not gonna try.

1051
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,699
I'm not even, I was
thinking about it.

1052
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:14,159
Like I think I can do that.
I can't do that

1053
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:16,889
Dan: every time.
I think I can speak

1054
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:18,090
in a British accent.
It does not go well.

1055
00:50:18,094 --> 00:50:19,800
I, I feel like I need
to get warmed up on a British

1056
00:50:19,804 --> 00:50:20,099
accent.

1057
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:23,130
Bekah: I like mixed British
and Australian, but I

1058
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:30,554
hear that that is not. uncommon.
like my coworker, my teammate

1059
00:50:25,994 --> 00:50:33,614
is, he is from England Uhhuh
and he said, whenever he's in

1060
00:50:30,644 --> 00:50:35,565
the us, people either think
he's from Australia or England.

1061
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:39,344
They're not usually really sure.
And he asked the, one of

1062
00:50:37,304 --> 00:50:41,505
the people when we were
together, she was like,

1063
00:50:39,344 --> 00:50:42,315
oh, that accent he's like,
where do you think I'm from?

1064
00:50:42,315 --> 00:50:45,525
And she was like, it's
either British or Australia.

1065
00:50:45,525 --> 00:50:47,385
And it was like, yep.

1066
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:51,885
Dan: Yeah, I
had, when I went to.

1067
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:58,275
Scotland, Like a long
time ago before kids.

1068
00:50:59,324 --> 00:51:01,545
So more than six years
ago, I don't know.

1069
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:04,414
I don't know how much more.
but, no, I really

1070
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:07,054
practiced it when I was there.
I had, I felt like I had a

1071
00:51:04,414 --> 00:51:14,224
pretty good Scottish boot. Oh no.
It's pass it, I think

1072
00:51:08,105 --> 00:51:15,335
it keeps recording.
I think it's just a screensaver.

1073
00:51:15,335 --> 00:51:16,835
I think it keeps recording
when it does that, but,

1074
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,974
I didn't wanna risk it.
anyway. Yeah, I had a good

1075
00:51:19,715 --> 00:51:21,275
Scottish accent going for.
a while.

1076
00:51:21,635 --> 00:51:24,034
Learned some good words here.
Have you heard the word shuggled?

1077
00:51:24,784 --> 00:51:25,114
Bekah: What?

1078
00:51:25,155 --> 00:51:28,715
Dan: Shuggled Shuggled
is like shaken, you know?

1079
00:51:28,894 --> 00:51:28,954
Bekah: Oh,

1080
00:51:28,954 --> 00:51:31,934
Dan: like, like shook up,
you as a bus driver was

1081
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,545
driving over some bumpy stuff
and, and, and she was like

1082
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:37,275
something about sorry, you
all Shuggled or something.

1083
00:51:38,894 --> 00:51:40,574
It was, a, it was really fun.
I like accents.

1084
00:51:40,605 --> 00:51:42,195
I'm not like good at
practicing them, but,

1085
00:51:42,344 --> 00:51:45,284
that's a good idea. Yeah.

1086
00:51:45,775 --> 00:51:47,054
Bekah: All Ry

00:51:47,059 --> 00:51:49,244

1089
00:51:52,844 --> 00:51:53,465
Bekah: Quirky German?

1090
00:51:53,469 --> 00:51:54,614
Dan: Yeah.
Not like a serious German.

1091

There's like serious German.
And there's like, you

Bekah: Saturday Night Live is on
too late.

1097
00:52:09,315 --> 00:52:12,045

1106
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:37,469
Dan: I don't know that one,
but anyway, we've gone Yes.

1107
00:52:37,469 --> 00:52:41,369
Way off the beaten path.
Thanks Travis. I'm blaming with

1108
00:52:40,469 --> 00:52:41,369
Travis for that one.

1109
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:41,610
Bekah: Yeah.

1110
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:44,565
Dan: Is that the last,

1111
00:52:44,565 --> 00:52:48,284
Bekah: I think
that we're, that we've

1112
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:48,284
covered everything.

1113
00:52:48,614 --> 00:52:56,594
Dan: Okay. All right.
That's kind of, expecting

1114
00:52:52,905 --> 00:52:57,554
some of our friends to stop
by and say hi, but nobody did

1115
00:52:57,735 --> 00:52:59,655
Bekah: well.
It's also really hard to hear.

1116
00:53:00,014 --> 00:53:00,344
Dan: Well, sure.

1117
00:53:00,525 --> 00:53:02,894
Bekah: But I, and I know
