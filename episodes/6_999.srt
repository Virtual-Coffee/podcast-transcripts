00:00:08,294 --> 00:00:11,925
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello and
welcome to Season 6 of the

2
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:13,700
Virtual Coffee Podcast. We are
live and in-person

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,700
at Kansas City Developers
Conference. This should be our

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,500
50th- 50th episode of the
podcast. But we had some

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,000
technical difficulties and-

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,089
Dan Ott: This is the 49th.

7
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:25,000
Bekah: This is the 49th. But
we're

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
gonna pretend like it's very
special-

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,300
Dan: I mean--

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,559
Bekah: -and that it is the 50th.

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,719
Dan: Sure. Yeah. Well, if we
publish it-

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:30,725
Bekah: Yeah.

13
00:00:30,725 --> 00:00:31,230
Dan: -after, then it will--

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,300
Bekah: So this is definitely

15
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,990
the 50th episode of the Virtual
Coffee Podcast [laughs]. And--

16
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:40,320
Dan: Here with me today--

17
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:43,000
Bekah: [Laughs] Here with me
today is my co-host, Dan.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,659
Dan: Wwwuddup, Bek? How's it
going?

19
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:46,700
Bekah: Hey, it's going.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,300
Dan: Yeah?

21
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:47,729
Bekah: It's going good.

22
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:49,000
Done with my talk, and I'm very
happy to--

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,130
Dan: She did great.

24
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,494
Bekah: I-- it [crosstalk]
wasn't my best [crosstalk]

25
00:00:51,494 --> 00:00:52,678
performance.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,700
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. No, it was
good.

27
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,000
Bekah: No.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,659
Dan: I saw it. You didn't-

29
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:55,000
Bekah: It happened.

30
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Dan: -you didn't see it.

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,939
Bekah: It was okay.

32
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:57,800
Dan: You can't--

33
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,700
Bekah: So people got up and left

34
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,590
during my talk, and then I-- it
was very thrown off.

35
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:02,000
Dan: I feel like they just said
that--

36
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
Bekah: And I said something that
was funny and nobody laughed.

37
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,000
Dan: I laughed.

38
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,500
Bekah: And then I was

39
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,439
like, "Oh. I'm not really funny
[chuckles]."

40
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,319
Dan: Yeah. Bekah did a great job
at her talk.

41
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:13,900
Todd, we-

42
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,370
Bekah: I did an okay talk.

43
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,019
Dan: -another Virtual Coffee
member, Todd, I saw his talk

44
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:18,900
right before yours. That was
also really good.

45
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,790
Bekah: Yeah.

46
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,000
Dan: But Tom Cudd is-

47
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Bekah: Tom is--

48
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,825
Dan: -to- tomorrow, I think.

49
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:24,700
Bekah: Tomorrow.

50
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,000
Dan: Who else?

51
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Bekah: Chris DeMars.

52
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,000
Dan: Chris is now, I think,

53
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,420
actually [chuckles].

54
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:30,700
Bekah: Yeah.

55
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,200
Dan: Sorry, Chris.

56
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,000
Bekah: Yeah.

57
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,300
Dan: Yeah.

58
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,000
Bekah: Yeah. This has been good.
We got up and got to do

59
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,620
in-person coffee this morning,
which was a lot of fun.

60
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,310
And now we're gonna be answering
some of the questions that

61
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,300
you all submitted. And I think-

62
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,300
Dan: Yeah!

63
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,750
Bekah: -we'll do it soon.

64
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,700
Dan: Yeah! We were supposed to
do this live.

65
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,909
But ... there's no Wi-Fi here.
That's good. So we're recording.

66
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:54,700
We're gonna publish it.

67
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,000
Bekah: Yes.

68
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,680
Dan: In a little bit.

69
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:57,300
Bekah: Yeah. So--

70
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,000
Dan: Some time.

71
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Bekah: Alright.

72
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,500
Dan: Alright.

73
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,349
Bekah: Ready to get started with
some questions?

74
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:01,800
Dan: I guess so.

75
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,540
Bekah: So- so we've got some
anonymous questions.

76
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,000
I've only viewed one of them

77
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,530
and the others we have not
viewed at all.

78
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:08,000
So we'll see what those are.

79
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,300
Dan: Okay.

80
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,000
Bekah: And we have some that are

81
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,500
not anonymous and we'll go
through those as well.

82
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,000
Dan: Okay. Sounds good.

83
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:19,289
Bekah: The- the first question
is an anonymous one. And it is,

84
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,060
what time do you go to sleep?

85
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,000
Dan: Hmm. I try to go to sleep,
like,

86
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,030
10-ish most days, you know?

87
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:31,724
Bekah: Yeah, I feel like that's
also what I go for.

88
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:36,465
Last night, we said we would go
to sleep at 11.

89
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:37,995
Dan: Well, you said that. I
never promised anything.

90
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,115
Bekah: Okay. Well, I said, "Dan,
I'll meet you from 10 to 11"-

91
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:41,594
Dan: Mm-hmm.

92
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,000
Bekah: -and then we stayed up
later.

93
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,500
Dan: Yep. Well, we had catching

94
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,700
up to do, and my plane got
delayed to infinity.

95
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,700
And so, I finally made it.

96
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,314
Bekah: Yeah.

97
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:51,700
Dan: And Bekah--

98
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,775
Bekah: And then somebody
challenged

99
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:56,205
my ability to weight lift. And
... then I- I had to take

100
00:02:56,205 --> 00:02:56,715
care of that.

101
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:57,000
Dan: Well, he wasn't challenging
your ability.

102
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,900
He was challenging, like,

103
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,500
your form, which is I think
even more-

104
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,700
Bekah: Yeah!

105
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,854
Dan: -ridiculous. He was, like,
absurd.

106
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:02,500
Bekah: He was like, "Is this--
how do you-- show me how

107
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,294
you ..." How dare you? First of
all [chuckles]--

108
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:06,000
Dan: [Laughs] I just don't think
he knew who

109
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,500
he was talking to, you know?

110
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:07,800
Bekah: No.

111
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,365
Dan: Yeah.

112
00:03:08,985 --> 00:03:11,115
Bekah: Yeah. Don't challenge my
weight lift form.

113
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:12,604
Don't mansplain my deadlift.

114
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:15,854
Dan: Especially not at 11.45 at
night at a-- at a-- at a bar.

115
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:18,944
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. It all ended
peacefully though.

116
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:20,985
I am happy to report. I did--

117
00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:23,000
Dan: Yep. She deadlifted that
guy. And then, you know,

118
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
threw him into the street? I
don't know [laughs].

119
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,354
Bekah: Uh-huh. Yep, exactly.

120
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,694
That's exactly what I did. I did
not.

121
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:33,074
I was very kind to him. Maybe. I
can't promise. Okay.

122
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:36,000
Alright, alright. Let me--
let's go with the

123
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,715
anonymous questions first.

124
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:40,455
Dan: Wait. Who? Wait. Was that
first one anonymous?

125
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,300
Bekah: That was an anonymous
one.

126
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,000
Dan: It was in your notebook?

127
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,600
Bekah: Yeah, because I wrote it
down before, okay?

128
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,000
Dan: Oh, you looked and-

129
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,500
Bekah: Cuz I was-

130
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Dan: -wrote it down. Okay.

131
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,430
Bekah: -afraid it was gonna
disappear. I never used this

132
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,600
anonymous app thing before. And
so I wasn't sure.

133
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,800
Like, I opened it. Now, is this
like Snapchat

134
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,949
and it goes away after 50
seconds or something?

135
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm not sure how Snapchat works.

136
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,560
Dan: Yeah. Technology. I have no
idea.

137
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,219
Bekah: All right. So I hope that
these are all ... appropriate.

138
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,000
Well, that one says Netflix and
chill, so--

139
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,930
Dan: Well, hey.

140
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:10,700
Bekah: That's--

141
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,000
Dan: Just--

142
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Bekah: There we go.

143
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,300
Dan: Nope.

144
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,454
Bekah: Please give me pickup
lines that always work [laughs].

145
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:19,800
Dan: Well, that's not a
question. So--

146
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Bekah: That's a demand. We
don't-

147
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Dan: They failed-- they failed
the--

148
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,404
Bekah: We don't negotiate.

149
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,254
Dan: I mean, just read the
instructions, people.

150
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:28,245
[Bekah chuckles] It's not hard.
We were looking for

151
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:30,194
questions, not demands.

152
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:33,700
Bekah: All right. Here we go.
What extra work goes

153
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,000
into landing a full-time
international remote role,

154
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,500
as a first role out of webdev
bootcamp, with no

155
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,399
prior developer experience?
That's a really good question.

156
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,110
I feel like this is something
that we talk a

157
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,700
lot about at Virtual Coffee.
Maybe not so much the landing

158
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,700
an international remote role,
because that's a

159
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,000
little bit more challenging. Not
all companies can work

160
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,700
internationally. So you really
need to narrow it down to

161
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,720
see what companies allow for
international remote work.

162
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,000
Dan: Right. Yeah. And- and- and
those points

163
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,700
you're gonna have to start
looking and see if the companies

164
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,800
have, like, supported visa stuff
and, you know, lawyers to

165
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
help you, things like that.
There's a lot of, like ... laws,

166
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,000
and rules, and things that can
come into play, I think,

167
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,550
with international stuff, right?

168
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,540
Bekah: Yeah, for sure.

169
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,319
Dan: But if you set that- that
part of it aside

170
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,800
a little bit, right? What kind
of stuff can we

171
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,254
do, coming out of bootcamp to,
like, land your first job?

172
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:33,045
Bekah: Yeah. I was just talking
to someone about this recently.

173
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:35,685
She's gonna be learning how to
code in a couple of months.

174
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:35,885
Dan: Okay.

175
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:41,000
Bekah: She's a- a mom of a
couple of kids. And I- I think

176
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,300
that once

177
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,000
you're getting close to applying
for jobs, working with other

178
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,500
people and building projects
together is something that

179
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,700
can really help you stand apart-

180
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,000
Dan: Yeah.

181
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Bekah: -because there's a lot

182
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,700
of people coming out of
bootcamps right now. But a lot

183
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,000
of them

184
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,319
have experience where they've
just worked on their own stuff.

185
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,060
They haven't worked
collaboratively,

186
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:00,120
they don't communicate aloud
with other developers.

187
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,310
And when you're going into those
interviews, you're going to have

188
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,700
to communicate aloud about code.
And that can be—I know

189
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,990
for me—that was a really hard
learning curve.

190
00:06:06,995 --> 00:06:11,220
I was not good at speaking code
words out loud.

191
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,540
Dan: Speaking code words out
loud. Yeah.

192
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

193
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,519
Dan: I mean, that's a silly way
to say that.

194
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,000
But, like, I think that--

195
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,769
Bekah: So I told you I wasn't
good at it.

196
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:18,899
Dan: I- I mean, I totally agree
with that.

197
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:20,474
I- I mean, I- I'm always a
proponent of, like, building

198
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:22,049
things,

199
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,500
you know, as a way to learn. And
I think-- yeah, I think

200
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
building something with other
people is also very

201
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,370
important ... skill to, like--
start to-- it-

202
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,269
it doesn't always, like-- it
isn't always taught, right?

203
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,259
It's not always taught in a
classroom.

204
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:37,139
I- I know that, like, lots of
bootcamps do have collaborative

205
00:06:37,144 --> 00:06:40,439
projects. It's part of their
curriculum. But it's a

206
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,300
little different, I suppose,
when it's not a school-

207
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,170
Bekah: Yeah.

208
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,639
Dan: -project or, you know,
bootcamp, whatever--

209
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,000
a classroom situation. But yeah,
like, learning-- that--

210
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
that's, like, one of the--
especially if you're hiring a

211
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
junior role like that, where
you're gonna be interviewing--

212
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,800
where you're expecting to hire
somebody ... at that

213
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,709
level. Those sorts of skills are
something they

214
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,949
can set you as-- like, far
apart from- from other

215
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:04,290
people from-- in the same boat,
right?

216
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:09,404
You know, so, they all-- like,
the- the- the-- like, breadth

217
00:07:09,464 --> 00:07:11,894
of technical skills at that
level will be, like, pretty

218
00:07:11,894 --> 00:07:15,435
tight. And so, ways to-- ways
to, like, set yourself apart.

219
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,925
I think communication skills is
like a huge one, right?

220
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:20,204
I mean, if I-- if I have-- if
I'm interviewing with somebody,

221
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:22,495
and they can- they can sort of
speak well and have

222
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:26,949
some, like-- I mean, speak well
about- about code. Like

223
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,000
you were saying, use code words.
Like, whatever. All of

224
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,740
that- that sort

225
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,839
of thing are- are used to, like,
talking out loud, or explaining

226
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,129
some processes, or even just
explaining how a thing works

227
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:37,000
that you built, you know?

228
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,300
Bekah: Yeah.

229
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Dan: Even if it's a thing that's

230
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,000
for bootcamp. Maybe lots of
times-- well, I've never been

231
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,300
to do

232
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,000
bootcamp, so I- I don't know.
But, like, you would turn in

233
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the assignment. I don't know. Do
you do, like, presentations

234
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,000
after you finish?

235
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Bekah: We did. So for each of
our-- we

236
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,259
had, like, a series of projects
that we had to do.

237
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:56,189
And so, after each one, we had
to walk through the code. And

238
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:59,850
then for the last one, they
asked us questions. And we had

239
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,240
to add on a feature depending on
what the interviewer

240
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:07,845
felt would work for the
application that you created.

241
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,000
Dan: Okay.

242
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Bekah: So there was live coding
that was involved in that.

243
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,024
Dan: Nice. That's cool.

244
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:11,865
Bekah: Yeah. And I feel like you

245
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:15,800
can get somebody who is
experienced in the industry

246
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,000
to do the same thing with you.
So if you have-

247
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,300
Dan: Sure.

248
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,000
Bekah: -a project

249
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,900
that you're using as a portfolio
project, then what you can do

250
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,764
is say like, "Hey, would you
mind walking through this with

251
00:08:24,764 --> 00:08:27,915
me? Suggest, like, what I can
do?" Do a code review with

252
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:31,665
somebody, just so you get an
understanding of, like, whether

253
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,000
or not your code is written
well. I think that you'll always

254
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,800
be able to improve on your code.
But when you're doing it

255
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,500
in isolation and you're often
just trying to see,

256
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,800
like, does this work-

257
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,000
Dan: Right.

258
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Bekah: -you know, there's more
that goes

259
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
into coding than does this work.

260
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,300
Dan: Yeah.

261
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:51,389
Bekah: Is it-- is it written
well or efficiently?

262
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:53,309
Dan: Yeah. Oh, I- I think that's
great.

263
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:56,355
And- and I think, another path
to practice that sort of

264
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:58,044
thing is open source as well.

265
00:08:58,044 --> 00:08:58,304
Bekah: Yeah.

266
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,674
Dan: And another thing that we
talk about a lot in Virtual

267
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:04,544
Coffee, at-- in this podcast,
is it's another great way

268
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,085
to practice those skills and
prac- you know, see

269
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:12,945
what works and- and- and join
other code bases.

270
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:16,875
And, like, that's another skill
that is- is ... sometimes

271
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,460
maybe a harder one to learn--
not harder one to learn, but

272
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,000
maybe not an obvious one to
learn.

273
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,300
Bekah: Yeah.

274
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,600
Dan: It is like how to dig into
an unfamiliar code base,

275
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:24,710
right? And-

276
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,300
Bekah: Yeah.

277
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,300
Dan: -there's, like-- [chuckles]
there's-

278
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,500
there's some things that you can
do to make it easier, but

279
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,879
in general, it's very much just
practice.

280
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,549
It will-- you know, like, if you
practice it, it will--

281
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:37,000
you'll get better at it. And so
there's a million-- billion

282
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
projects [chuckles] out there on
GitHub that all are looking

283
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,690
for help. And ... you know. I
don't know. Jump in.

284
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:44,779
Bekah: Yeah.

285
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,879
Dan: I-- we have a lot of
episodes where we've talked

286
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,575
about, like, all- all the
reasons why it's a good idea to

287
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:56,205
do it. And, like-- also, like, the
... things to do to- to get over

288
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:58,995
some anxiety you might-- may
have about- about doing that

289
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
as a-- as a junior developer.
Like, just jump in or,

290
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
[chuckles] you know, do some
peer-- pull requests on just

291
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,784
documentation or whatever, just
to get your feet wet.

292
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:10,004
Like, that kind of thing.
There's, like, a

293
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:10,514
lot of stuff like that. So--

294
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,600
Bekah: Yeah. And I think, also,
it's a

295
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,000
pretty easy ask to say like,
"Hey, I really wanna get

296
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,759
started in open source. I'm a
little nervous about this.

297
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,700
Is there anybody out there that
would be up for

298
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,730
mentoring me through it if I'm
struggling?"

299
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,149
Dan: Yeah.

300
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:26,070
Bekah: And then that way, you
know, you can pair up with

301
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:28,259
someone, you can work on those
communication skills, and then

302
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:30,779
you don't have to feel nervous
about what you're doing.

303
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:31,799
You have that support.

304
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,700
Dan: Agreed. And ... absolutely
agreed. And, like, join Virtual

305
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,000
Coffee [chuckles], you know what
I mean? It's-- there's a

306
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,580
lot of people

307
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,370
that are always down to help
with that sort of thing.

308
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:43,649
And it's good.

309
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:44,519
Bekah: Yeah.

310
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,500
Dan: All right. Before we go on,
I'm getting

311
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,800
really nervous that I forgot to
hit record or it didn't work.

312
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,000
So I'm just gonna go look at it-

313
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:51,000
Bekah: Yep. Go check it
[laughs].

314
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,669
Dan: -really quick. Yeah. No,
we're good.

315
00:10:56,909 --> 00:10:58,800
Bekah: We're good. We're good.
We've been recording. Per-

316
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,490
excellent.

317
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Dan: We're good. Everything is
okay.

318
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:01,350
Bekah: Cuz I was gonna make you
do the whole thing over.

319
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:02,639
Dan: Yeah, that would be rough.

320
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,639
Bekah: Okay. So, let's see.

321
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,870
Did we-- so your first role--
and- and along with landing

322
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,169
your first role, I think always
finding community,

323
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,259
finding people, and remembering
that, like, your network is

324
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,330
not just the people you know.
It's the network of the

325
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,000
people you know. So-

326
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,500
Dan: Yeah.

327
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,600
Bekah: -making connections that

328
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,000
are not transactional, and like,
"Hey, I want to know

329
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
you so I can get a job," right?
Like, get to know people and-

330
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,200
Dan: Yeah.

331
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,065
Bekah: -be their friends, be
kind, don't criticize their

332
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:33,500
deadlift form, [Dan laughs] and
then you-- you'll have a

333
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:33,945
better shot at finding a job.

334
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:37,300
Dan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Probably- probably just

335
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,800
in general, not giving an-- you
know, giving advice to

336
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,600
people who didn't ask for it,
you know? Especially

337
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,065
people you don't know.

338
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:45,000
Bekah: I mean, like, generally
speaking, I

339
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,975
like it when people give me
advice. I know that that's,

340
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,345
like, kind of controversial, cuz
a lot of people are

341
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:51,420
like-

342
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:51,700
Dan: Oh, yeah [chuckles].

343
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,955
Bekah: -"Don't give me advice. I
didn't ask for it."

344
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:56,054
But I- I don't know. I like to
hear what

345
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:59,384
other people have to say. And I
often ask for advice a lot.

346
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:03,434
I guess that's another bit of
advice is ask- ask for advice

347
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:06,735
because not everybody's just
gonna give it to you. Also,

348
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:09,000
sometimes advice is bad. People
get bad advice.

349
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,615
Dan: That's not true.

350
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,924
Bekah: Like, also his deadlift
stance [Dan chuckles] yesterday.

351
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:14,235
I'll get over that in a couple
of weeks.

352
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:14,985
Dan: Yeah, right?

353
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Bekah: I'm--

354
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Dan: I'm personally shocked

355
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
that the drunk guy at the bar
last night didn't have

356
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,855
perfect deadlift form [laughs].

357
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:25,965
Bekah: All right. Let's go to
the next one.

358
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:27,164
Dan: Okay. Next question.

359
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:29,924
Bekah: I don't know what that
says. And what happened?

360
00:12:29,924 --> 00:12:30,975
Oh, no.

361
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,000
Dan: I- I don't know.

362
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,735
Bekah: It might not let me
answer.

363
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:36,825
Wait a minute. I don't wanna do
that. [Silence]

364
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,384
[Chuckles] How does a computer
get drunk?

365
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:46,679
Dan: Well, do you know the
answer?

366
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,610
Bekah: No.

367
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,080
Dan: Screenshots.

368
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,929
Bekah: [Laughs] Did you submit
that question?

369
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:53,000
Dan: I- I did. I did. That was
me.

370
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,289
[All laugh] This is a good one,
right?

371
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:00,840
Bekah: Who was the last dude you
texted?

372
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:02,220
Dan: Jesus christ, people.

373
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,335
Bekah: Let's see. Probably Dan.
Probably

374
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:12,225
you. You were the- the last one
I texted.

375
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,554
Dan: Yes. I don't know. I mean
... are- are you asking me?

376
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:16,725
Cuz I don't know-

377
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:17,000
Bekah: I don't know.

378
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Dan: I don't know who you
texted.

379
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,615
Bekah: I- I didn't--

380
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:19,875
Dan: You did text me recently.

381
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,514
Bekah: I did recently text you.
About this conference.

382
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:25,014
Who was the last dude you
texted?

383
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:30,000
Dan: Mm ... I dunno. My-- one
of my friends?

384
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,004
One of my friends

385
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:32,745
just took his dog out in the
canoe for the first time.

386
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,144
And so he was sharing pictures
of that. And I said,

387
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:35,945
"That's cool."

388
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:36,664
Bekah: Nice.

389
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:37,304
Dan: Yeah.

390
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:39,825
Bekah: That was excellent. So-
so there- there you have it.

391
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:41,000
We did really well. Those
anonymous

392
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,700
questions were fantastic. Thank
you all for doing such

393
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,600
a good job of sending them [all
laugh]. We do have a handful

394
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,300
of non-anonymous questions.
Un-anonymous-- unanimous

395
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:54,600
question.

396
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:55,139
Dan: Unanimous?

397
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,519
Bekah: Mm-hmm. I think that's
the right word.

398
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:59,100
Dan: Un-anonymous, I think.

399
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:05,340
Bekah: Un-anonymous. I wrote one
of 'em down.

400
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,300
Dan: Oh.

401
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,970
Bekah: So I wouldn't forget.
Okay. This one comes from Meg.

402
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,029
Dan: Is this notebook from,
like, 1920 or something?

403
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,340
Bekah: Listen. I keep buying
these notebooks.

404
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,500
They sell them at T.J. Maxx in a
pack of three.

405
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,559
This one says the right stuff. I
like these notebooks.

406
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:20,519
Dan: Look at the inside though.
Show them the inside.

407
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:22,544
Bekah: What's wrong with the
inside?

408
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:26,684
Dan: It looks like it's, you
know, paper from ... the

409
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:27,644
civil war or something [laughs].

410
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:31,004
Bekah: [Chuckles] Is that what
civil war paper looked like?

411
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:32,424
Dan: I don't know. But
probably.

412
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,475
Bekah: I think you're wrong. And
a liar.

413
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:36,884
Dan: Oh, I and ... here we go.

414
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:38,325
Bekah: All right. This one's
from Meg.

415
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:40,865
Is there anything you would've
done differently

416
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:44,355
when it comes to Virtual
Coffee's setup, organization,

417
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,565
time commitment, et cetera. You
go first.

418
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:49,800
Dan: I mean, that's a really
good question. But, like, it's

419
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
hard to have an answer for it
because everything

420
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,600
that, like, has happened has
been so organic, you know?

421
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:54,825
Bekah: Yeah.

422
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:58,000
Dan: And you- you-- like, you
think about, like, all the

423
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,379
things that

424
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:00,000
we have going on right now,
like, everything that's

425
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
in play and- and, like-- yeah.
Like, I can think of a

426
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,500
lot of things that could be
better, or, you know,

427
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,800
right now, or whatever. But ...
I think if we had

428
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,500
started from scratch in, like--
we're like, "Let's try to build

429
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,800
this community, but, like, start
...," you know, I- I don't

430
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,300
know. Who

431
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,475
knows what we would've done, you
know what I mean?

432
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:22,845
And it probably-- I don't know.
It's a good chance

433
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,254
it wouldn't have worked maybe.
You know what I mean?

434
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:24,400
Like-

435
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:24,600
Bekah: Yeah.

436
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,700
Dan: -like, I'd like to think it

437
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,000
would've, but the- the-- one of
the beauties of the-- of

438
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
the community-- of the Virtual
Coffee community is- is the

439
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,184
sort of organic, like, nature of
how all that starting it.

440
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,000
And of course, all that was,
like, around you [chuckles].

441
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,644
But, like,

442
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:41,514
it's-- and it's, like, one of
the reasons why Virtual Coffee

443
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:42,000
is sort of different and-

444
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,300
Bekah: Yeah.

445
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,000
Dan: -successful. I've-- I feel
it. As opposed to, like

446
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,504
... I'm trying to think

447
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:51,414
of an example but, you know, I
suppose there's people who

448
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:53,575
are like, "I'm gonna start a
community," or something.

449
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:56,784
And sometimes they're cool, and
sometimes they're not. But

450
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,039
you never know what it's--
like, you never know what's

451
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,070
gonna happen un- until it
happens with- with, like,

452
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,090
groups of people, you know?

453
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:03,509
Bekah: Yeah.

454
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,899
Dan: So, I don't know ... I
mean, I could think

455
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,389
of-- I don't know. I could think
of, like, a lot of,

456
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:13,000
like, little instant-- like,
instances of times that like,

457
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,800
"Okay, I wish I made a
di-different decision there,"

458
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,700
you know? But

459
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,800
that's- that's less like--
that's more just like I make

460
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,000
mistakes,

461
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
not- not so much like ... you
know, tactical, like, planning

462
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,149
stuff. You know what I mean?

463
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,480
Bekah: Yeah.

464
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,750
Dan: I dunno. What about you?

465
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,690
Bekah: Well, I think it's nice
because- because of, like, the

466
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,889
authenticity and the organic
evolution of Virtual Coffee

467
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:38,120
that we have more freedom to
make mistakes almost, right?

468
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,179
Dan: Yeah.

469
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,700
Bekah: Because we know that the
people who are coming

470
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,519
to Virtual Coffee are okay with
that. Because they know

471
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,470
that we're human beings, and we,
like, we do get things

472
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,980
wrong sometimes. I, for sure,
have gotten things wrong on a

473
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:50,500
number of things at-

474
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:50,700
Dan: Yeah.

475
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,044
Bekah: -Virtual Coffee. And, you
know, you-

476
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:54,870
you try and get 'em right the
next time, you learn

477
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,000
your lesson-

478
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,200
Dan: Yeah.

479
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,110
Bekah: -you apologize when you
need to.

480
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:04,480
And I- I think a lot about what
I would do differently.

481
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,250
But I actually think it's kind
of a strength that we

482
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,279
had no idea what we were doing
in the beginning.

483
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,519
Dan: Yeah.

484
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:14,730
Bekah: Because, you know, now
that I'm community building

485
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,079
professionally, I'm, like,
diving into things like

486
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:24,000
metrics, and planning, and a lot
of different, like,

487
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,960
processes and procedures that I
wouldn't have considered before.

488
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:31,680
And I think that sometimes it
actually makes me less creative

489
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,500
with-

490
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:34,700
Dan: Yeah.

491
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:34,701
Bekah: -what the community will
look like, because I see

492
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,740
what everybody else is doing.
And it feels like these are

493
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,000
the things that you should be
doing if you're building

494
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,500
a community-

495
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:39,700
Dan: Right.

496
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,460
Bekah: -because this is what the
experts say.

497
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,180
And I'm like-- sometimes I get
caught up with-- in it, like,

498
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,500
thinking about Virtual Coffee.
And I'm like-

499
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:46,700
Dan: Yeah.

500
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,369
Bekah: -"No," you know,

501
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:52,920
"This is-- that's not true to
who we are as a community."

502
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,009
Dan: Right.

503
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,519
Bekah: But I'm, like, trying to
think too [sighs] [silence]

504
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:05,500
what I would do differently. I-
I think I would find more

505
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,700
ways early on to allow people to
support the efforts of

506
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,700
Virtual Coffee to provide more
autonomy for members

507
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,000
to do their own things. Like,
I'm really enjoying

508
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,500
seeing the coffee table groups-

509
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,600
Dan: Mm-hmm.

510
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,954
Bekah: -grow, and the different

511
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:22,500
things that we're doing. Ray is
doing the Virtual

512
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,800
Coffee speech club now.

513
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,000
Dan: Yeah.

514
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,700
Bekah: And, like, I love that.
That's

515
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,800
one of my favorite things. But,
like, finding more ways

516
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,000
to empower people to do that.
Like, honestly, I wish that

517
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I had more time in the day
because I think that we have

518
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,700
so many great people at Virtual
Coffee that are willing to

519
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,000
provide support for-

520
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,000
Dan: Yeah.

521
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,700
Bekah: -a lot of different

522
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,700
things. And finding ... more
ways to empower them to do

523
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,335
that is one of those things that
I still wish that I could do

524
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:55,755
better.

525
00:18:55,904 --> 00:19:00,434
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that's
... that's a hard problem.

526
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,144
And, you know, I- I know of--
both from my experience and

527
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,994
from, like, talking to other
people, it's very hard to find

528
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:10,755
people that are willing to,
like, put time and effort into

529
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,585
something like a volunteer thing
like that, you know?

530
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:16,000
And I think that just goes ...
to show how awesome

531
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,500
Virtual Coffee is. That we have
all these people that

532
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,000
doing this stuff, you know? And
the- the to- coffee table

533
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
groups, all-- almost all of
them started before we, like--

534
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,300
just on their own, you know?
Right?

535
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:25,599
Bekah: Yeah.

536
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,300
Dan: Like, before we had
anything around them.

537
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,910
Like, we are building

538
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,424
stuff to support them now
because they existed already,

539
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:35,055
you know? As opposed to, like,
we had some idea for coffee

540
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:37,194
table groups and then we're
trying to find people to- to

541
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,815
do them or something like that,
right? And that's, you know, it

542
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:42,944
just goes back to the, you know,
the organic

543
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:48,700
nature of Virtual Coffee. And
... if we were planning

544
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,000
this-- I mean, you could see,
like, special interest

545
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,800
groups being a thing to plan
[chuckles], you know, if

546
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,795
you're trying to plan a group
ahead of time-- or a community.

547
00:19:57,914 --> 00:20:01,000
But-- I don't know. It's- it's
hard to imagine,

548
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
like, trying to do all this
stuff a-ahead of time, or

549
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,045
whatever [chuckles], you know
what I mean?

550
00:20:06,134 --> 00:20:06,434
Bekah: Yeah.

551
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,420
Dan: Also, it's not usually how
my brain works

552
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,300
that way anyway. I- I mean,
[chuckles] the- the way that

553
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,539
things have

554
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,869
gone is what-- you know, is
obviously, like, it's more how

555
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:18,000
my brain works anyway, you know?
Kind of like-

556
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,300
Bekah: Same.

557
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:18,509
Dan: -go along with

558
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,670
things and trying to make things
better, but-- I don't know.

559
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,970
It's ... well, it is what it is.
I don't know.

560
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,800
Bekah: Yeah. I mean, I ... I'm,
like, super proud of

561
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
us for early on getting a lot of
documentation in

562
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,000
place because that-

563
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,300
Dan: Yes.

564
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,809
Bekah: -has helped to provide a
better space for people.

565
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,300
Dan: Yeah.

566
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:40,000
Bekah: I- I would like-- I would
like to do

567
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,900
a better job of onboarding new
community members.

568
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,200
Dan: Yep.

569
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,769
Bekah: And I feel like that-
that from the beginning. So I

570
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:49,380
feel like a lot of the-- like,
would you do differently is--

571
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,670
are still things that, like, I
would like to do more of now.

572
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,750
Dan: Yeah, sure. Yeah.

573
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Bekah: Especially now that we
have

574
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,600
new members coming in. It's so
great to see new faces

575
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,180
at Virtual Coffee again.

576
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:01,240
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

577
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,259
Bekah: That's been a- a really
bright side of

578
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:06,800
the last couple of weeks. But I
just wanna make sure

579
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,700
that everybody's taken care of.

580
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,700
Dan: Yep. Yeah, I agree. And
that's, like, you know-- so

581
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,329
there's, like, technology stuff
that I- I just wanna change now.

582
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:18,210
It's- it's not even-- it's not
even like, "Oh, I wish we

583
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,390
had done this differently." It's
just ... well, now we need it.

584
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,190
Like, now we need things. Like,
there's things

585
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,500
we need, you know? So let's
change them. The- the

586
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
new member thing, especially.
It's especially cuz it's built,

587
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,000
like, originally around Slack
[chuckles], you know?

588
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,300
Bekah: Yeah.

589
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,220
Dan: And that's ... that
sounds--

590
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,750
Bekah: That, maybe, is something
I would change.

591
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:36,000
Dan: I don't know. Yeah. I mean,
like, maybe. But, like,

592
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,500
it was really before Discord,
like, took off-- like, took off

593
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,700
for people outside of gaming,
you know?

594
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

595
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Dan: And ... I don't know.

596
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,700
That-- there's any better
option and it, like, created the

597
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,039
community, honestly. Like, it--
like-- you know what I mean?

598
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,069
It's-- I mean, the Zooms and
the-- and the Slack, it's, like--

599
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:56,000
it's what was-- it was the
whole thing for first ...

600
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
however long. I don't know. I
dunno. Whatever. However

601
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
many months or whatever it was,
you know? So- so yeah.

602
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,769
Yeah. There's things that, like,
I'd like to see improved and

603
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:12,920
stuff. But it's-- I don't look
at them as- as, you know,

604
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,970
regrets or whatever, if that
makes sense.

605
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:20,800
Bekah: Yeah. Let me ... okay. So
the next question is, what's

606
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,434
the hardest part ... of
community?

607
00:22:26,714 --> 00:22:29,295
Dan: Of, like, run- running a
community?

608
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:33,345
Bekah: Just of community. So you
can take it as you-- as

609
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:35,039
you ... see fit.

610
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,029
Dan: I don't know, man. I--
like-- alright.

611
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:43,700
So, for me, part of-- as a
member of communities is- is

612
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,430
just like ...

613
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,800
it- it takes, like, emotional
energy for me to engage with

614
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,099
things, engage with people, and
do things or whatever.

615
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,190
And so sometimes I find myself,
like, just falling

616
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,944
out of communities or- or just,
like, not-- whatever.

617
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:01,595
And it- it even happens in
Virtual Coffee sometimes.

618
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,600
I mean, you and I ... I mean, we
talk all the

619
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,000
time, like, doing management
side. But, like, I-- I'll

620
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,800
miss, like, coffees for weeks
because it's, like ... eight

621
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,700
fifty in the morning, you know?
And- and it's not-- I'm

622
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,500
not tired or anything. It's
just, like, I need-- I

623
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,700
needed a certain amount of-- a
store of energy to be able to,

624
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,869
like, talk to people, you know?
Especially people I don't know.

625
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,630
And I love it. But, like,
sometimes it's-

626
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,000
sometimes it's hard. And so ...
I-- although that will say--

627
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,545
I will say, like, every time
that I've felt that

628
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:35,144
way but then still gone, I've
been very glad that I went-

629
00:23:35,144 --> 00:23:35,204
Bekah: Yeah.

630
00:23:35,204 --> 00:23:37,625
Dan: -you know what I mean?
Like, it's- it's one of

631
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,300
those, like, "Catch-22" where my
brain is, like, fooling

632
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,224
me about it, you know?

633
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,285
Bekah: Yeah.

634
00:23:39,944 --> 00:23:41,714
Dan: But, like, overcoming that,
that's-- that can be hard.

635
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:45,545
And then another thing for me
is, my memory's

636
00:23:45,545 --> 00:23:47,674
really bad, especially with,
like, names and stuff,

637
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:51,305
and, like-- a-and so, you know,
remembering people that I met,

638
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:53,700
or, like, that I'm supposed to
know, or let- you know,

639
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,214
I'll- I'll--

640
00:23:54,214 --> 00:23:57,214
I sensibly do know but have
forgotten who they are, or what

641
00:23:57,214 --> 00:23:59,555
their name is, or-- you know,
that happens to me, like, a lot.

642
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:02,000
And it's much easier online
because you can kinda

643
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
like look-- try to google them
or something [chuckles],

644
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,414
you know?

645
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:04,565
Bekah: Yeah.

646
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,700
Dan: Harder in-person. Like,
it's more- more

647
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,700
embarrassing for me in-person.
So it's-- that's my other-

648
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,484
Bekah: Yeah.

649
00:24:10,174 --> 00:24:11,200
Dan: -struggle. What about you?

650
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,700
Bekah: Well ... I guess the- the
thing that I never

651
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,805
would've thought

652
00:24:17,805 --> 00:24:22,875
about—before this community—was
last year when Mike passed

653
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,505
away. That was, like, obviously
a really hard experience.

654
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:30,765
He was an active community
member.

655
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:34,600
Like, everybody loved him. But
then, like,

656
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,000
making decisions-

657
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,300
Dan: Yeah.

658
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,000
Bekah: -about that-

659
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,484
Dan: Yep.

660
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:41,500
Bekah: -and having to tell
people over and over was--

661
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,434
Dan: Yeah?

662
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:45,900
Bekah: I- I-- like, something
that you can't ever be

663
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,724
prepared for.

664
00:24:46,724 --> 00:24:52,335
And so, like, experiencing the
losses of community members

665
00:24:53,204 --> 00:24:56,800
and with community members. And,
like, trying to leave

666
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,000
space for people to experience
grief in different ways-

667
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,234
Dan: Yeah.

668
00:25:01,244 --> 00:25:05,000
Bekah: -is just-- I- I don't
know. I felt like I was

669
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,914
stretched beyond my limits of
human being. Like, I-

670
00:25:10,914 --> 00:25:11,115
Dan: Yeah.

671
00:25:11,115 --> 00:25:14,000
Bekah: -went through-- and-
and, you know, it was hard

672
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,164
with Mike but, like,

673
00:25:15,164 --> 00:25:17,325
there have been other losses in
the communities, right?

674
00:25:17,325 --> 00:25:20,325
Like, there have been
miscarriages, there

675
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:23,625
have been jobs lost, there have
been relationships

676
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:27,800
that are no longer. And when
people, like, confide

677
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:34,000
in you, and talk to you about
that, it's just ... one of

678
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,700
those-- it is definitely the
hardest-

679
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,500
Dan: Yeah.

680
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,799
Bekah: -emotional labor that-
that

681
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,500
I have ever had to put in
anywhere. It- [chuckles]

682
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,500
it's like a "Catch-22" though,
right? Like-

683
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

684
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,579
Bekah: -you have to experience
...

685
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:58,700
like, the- the full humanness to
really be close and

686
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,500
supportive to the-

687
00:25:59,500 --> 00:25:59,800
Dan: Yeah.

688
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,140
Bekah: -the people around you.

689
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:06,029
So, like, would I love to not
ever have to experience

690
00:26:06,035 --> 00:26:07,000
any of those things?

691
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,200
Dan: Sure.

692
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,300
Bekah: Yeah. But I think it's
the-- a key part

693
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,000
of understanding the people in
front of us

694
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,400
to be there through it. So--

695
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,720
Dan: Yeah. No, I- I- I mean, I
totally agree. And that's, like--

696
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,700
it was- it was incredibly hard.
A- and ... but I just-- I was,

697
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,500
like, while you were talking
just now, I was just, like,

698
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,700
thinking of how ... thankful I
am that, like, Virtual

699
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,000
Coffee is- is what it is. And,
like, it's a place where

700
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,500
people can come to, like, share
... this- this horrible thing--

701
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,000
like, the heavy feelings or-

702
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,200
Bekah: Yeah.

703
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,700
Dan: -you know? It's-- it
obviously is

704
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,500
hard. But I think, like, my-- I
guess my point is just,

705
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:53,300
like ... that it's worth it.
Like [laughs]-

706
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,500
Bekah: Yeah.

707
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,000
Dan: -I guess it-- it's my
point, you know what I mean?

709
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,300
Bekah: Yeah.

710
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,000
Dan: Like, the-- like, it is,
like,

711
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
it- it-- it's ... yeah. It's
that. It's- it's just-- it's

712
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
hard but, like, it's also,
like-- it's what makes Virtual

713
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Coffee, like, what it is, you
know? I mean, the-- that's-

714
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,000
that's sort of, like,
connection. The-- you know, the-

715
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
the intimate connection, right?
Is- is-- I started noticing it

716
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
even before ... maybe right
around-- well, like, during

717
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
our, like, original

718
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Hacktoberfest time, you know?
Like, when we all started, like,

719
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,700
really doing that but, like,
just the-- alright. This is

720
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,300
gonna, like, sound--

721
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,000
it might sound like silly. But,
like, the fact that, like, people

722
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,039
would just, like, threw around
the heart emoji, you know?

723
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:34,240
And, like ... just to people, you
know? Like, not- not your best

724
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,369
friends or not-- but just, like,
people, like, in the community,

725
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:38,440
you know, made me feel good. I
don't-- I don't know why.

726
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:44,019
Like-- and- and- and to be able
to also-- like, also start

727
00:27:44,025 --> 00:27:45,789
throwing around the heart emoji
or whatever, you

728
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,710
know? Like, I-- it's like a--
it's, like, kind of a silly

729
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,500
way to say it. But, like, to- to
both share ... you

730
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,009
know, I guess sharing it, right?
Like, both-- like, two ways,

731
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:54,700
right? You know what I mean?

732
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,000
Bekah: Yeah.

733
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,259
Dan: There's, like-- there's-
there's good

734
00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:00,500
feelings coming ... both ways
and I-- from everybody

735
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,089
in the community. And, like, I
dunno. This-- it's good.

736
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,900
Bekah: Yeah. I think when you
can eg- share

737
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,269
your losses openly like that,
then you celebrate your wins-

738
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:12,359
Dan: Right.

739
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,269
Bekah: -you know, just as
strongly in the other direction.

740
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,289
So it- it is definitely one of
the hardest, but one of the

741
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,130
most rewarding to be able to
know that there are people

742
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,009
out there that trust you to
share that information that

743
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,990
you know. That if you're going
to be going through

744
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,259
something hard, that there are
gonna be people there too.

745
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,174
And I know that my empathy and
understanding of other people

746
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:38,204
has definitely-- I feel like-
like "The Grinch", right?

747
00:28:38,204 --> 00:28:39,000
Like [laughs]-

748
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,000
Dan: Yeah [laughs].

749
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:42,000
Bekah: I was a little bit of
"The Grinch"

750
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,335
before Virtual Coffee [laughs].

751
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:45,500
Dan: [Inaudible] Two- two--
three- three sizes. It's--

752
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,000
Bekah: Yeah.

753
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,900
Dan: No, that's a great call.

754
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,500
And that's a good point. Like, I
mean, I have learned

755
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,600
so much just about, like ...
yeah. Expressing myself and

756
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,000
talking to--

757
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
connecting with people and ...
yeah. My-- I was gonna say,

758
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
like, my- my, like, emotional
literacy, I feel like has

759
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:05,000
exploded over the last few
years. It- it reminds me of s-

760
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
... I forget what we were
talking about, but I was

761
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,000
talking with somebody and I was-
I was, like-- they were,

762
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,700
like-- this was earlier in
pandemic when things were,

763
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,095
like, still, like, a lot more
shutdown, you know?

764
00:29:18,095 --> 00:29:20,464
And they were talking about how
they hadn't, like-- they

765
00:29:20,464 --> 00:29:22,115
hadn't, like, meeting new people
or they haven't talked, you

766
00:29:22,115 --> 00:29:23,000
know, like, all this stuff. And
I'm like, "I've actually,

767
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
like, made more friends."

768
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,200
Bekah: Yeah.

769
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,000
Dan: And it is because of
Virtual

770
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Coffee-- or once Virtual Coffee
started but, like, made

771
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:32,000
more friends-- new friends in
that time-- in the last three

772
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,700
years than I had in the last 10
years before that [chuckles],

773
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,000
I think,

774
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
you know? Like, put together.
And, like-- and, like, good

775
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,500
friends. Not-

776
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,200
Bekah: Yeah.

777
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Dan: -you know, not just like
random Twitter

778
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,210
followers or something, you
know-- you know what I mean?

779
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:46,529
Like ... and- and-- yeah. I
mean, that's all-- that's all

780
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:49,470
Virtual Coffee, you know? It's-
it's just, like-- it's

781
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:49,650
good stuff.

782
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:52,900
Bekah: Yeah. And it's great.
Like, we get to

783
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
meet up some of us.

784
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,765
Dan: I know. Well, this is
[inaudible]--

785
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:56,234
Bekah: Which is really, really
nice.

786
00:29:56,234 --> 00:29:57,500
Dan: Yeah. This is the second
time that

787
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,875
Bekah and I have met in-person.
Cuz-- and when- when did we

788
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,434
meet? When did-- when did we,
like, start working together?

789
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,500
It's 20 ... 19?

790
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Bekah: July of two thousand--

791
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,300
Dan: 18?

792
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,600
Bekah: 18.

793
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,500
Dan: 18?

794
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,000
Bekah: I think.

795
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,500
Dan: Okay. Yeah. So--

796
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,000
Bekah: Yeah.

797
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Dan: Two times every ... four--
what year is it now?

798
00:30:16,964 --> 00:30:17,200
Bekah: 22.

799
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,500
Dan: 22? So it ... two times
every three years s-see each

800
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:21,800
other in-person?

801
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,000
Bekah: Yeah.

802
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,500
Dan: Right?

803
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,289
Bekah: Yeah. And we're in Kansas
City. So--

804
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,019
Dan: We're in Kansas City right
now. Make sense [laughs].

805
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:27,000
Bekah: We live, like, two hours
from each other, like [laughs]

806
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:28,500
... but--

807
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,150
Dan: This is the only place that
would take us, really. So--

808
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:30,800
Bekah: Yeah.

809
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,200
Dan: Yeah.

810
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,849
Bekah: I guess that's
understandable.

811
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,700
All right. Let's see what other
questions.

812
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,500
Dan: We got [inaudible] time
over your head [??].

813
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,000
Bekah: We still got-

814
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,500
Dan: Oh, we got.

815
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,710
Bekah: -some time.

816
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,609
Dan: Twenty minutes-ish before
the-- before hours up. I dunno.

817
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:48,000
Bekah: Um ... oh, okay.

818
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Dan: I suppose we should have

819
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,410
said something on Slack about
how we are going live.

820
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:52,059
Bekah: I did.

821
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:52,769
Dan: Oh, good job.

822
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:53,279
Bekah: Don't worry.

823
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:54,359
Dan: Did you do it on Twitter
too?

824
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,500
Bekah: I didn't on Twitter
though.

825
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Dan: Suck. Hey, I'm gonna--

826
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:01,700
Bekah: Sorry. Can't cover all
the spaces. Uh-oh. What did you

827
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,644
do? Did it pause it?

828
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,900
Dan: I don't-- I don't know if
it did for that

829
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,759
moment, but it is going again.
So ... we're in good shape.

830
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,119
Alright. The recording
[inaudible] of technical issues.

831
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:16,559
We've been recording for, like,
half hour or so.

832
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,000
Bekah: You need to sit-- be

833
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,529
in-- closer to your mic. Cuz I
can't hear you.

834
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:22,845
Dan: Has it-- that been true
the whole time? Or just now,

835
00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:23,500
since I got up?

836
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,855
Bekah: It was, like, just since
you got up.

837
00:31:24,855 --> 00:31:25,000
Dan: Okay, good.

838
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Bekah: All right. Where are the
questions?

839
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,555
Dan: I don't know.

840
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:29,384
Bekah: There was another one.
And--

841
00:31:29,384 --> 00:31:30,000
Dan: Oh, Ayu had a question that
was--

842
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,664
I know it was a trap.

843
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:33,555
Bekah: It was a trap?

844
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:33,855
Dan: Yeah, for me.

845
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:37,065
Bekah: It was a trap for you?
Okay, wait. Let me--

846
00:31:39,345 --> 00:31:41,384
Dan: I think it was on Twitter.

847
00:31:41,384 --> 00:31:44,000
Bekah: Twitter. Thanks, Barrett
Blake, for saying

848
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,234
the Virtual Coffee Podcast is a
must listen.

849
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:49,170
Dan: Yes. Thank you.

850
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,000
Bekah: We love it.

851
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,079
Dan: [Chuckles] We loved it.

852
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,329
Bekah: Um ... why can't I find
it? Okay.

853
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:59,890
Maybe it's the history of how
Virtual Coffee was found.

854
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,900
Oh, yes.

855
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,619
Dan: Yes. See?

856
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:03,240
Bekah: Go ahead.

857
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:04,890
Dan: What? I didn't found it.

858
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:10,829
Bekah: Well, you fired me
and--

859
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,601
Dan: See? Ayu's just-- [Bekah
laughs] this is, like--

860
00:32:13,605 --> 00:32:16,000
this is it. Every year, every
time. Starts like that. I didn't

861
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,800
fire you. Yeah.

862
00:32:20,234 --> 00:32:21,194
You heard it here, folks
[chuckles].

863
00:32:22,424 --> 00:32:27,404
Bekah: Dan said, "I will no
longer pay you to do work."

864
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:27,704
Dan: Oh, yes.

865
00:32:27,704 --> 00:32:32,100
Bekah: So you all are welcome to
define that as you see fit.

867
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,500
Dan: I don't--

868
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,454
Bekah: We should have them vote
for their favorite Virtual

869
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:39,194
Coffee host and see who wins.

870
00:32:40,484 --> 00:32:41,934
Dan: That doesn't sound very fun
for me [laughs].

871
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:44,970
Bekah: [Laughs] I mean, you mi-
you're probably a lot

872
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:45,839
of people's favorites.

873
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:48,000
Dan: Hmm ... I doubt it. It'll
probably be, like,

874
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,660
just one of our guests would win
[chuckles].

875
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,000
Bekah: One of our gue- Kirk.

876
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Bekah: Kirk is gonna be the one
that wins.

877
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,000
Dan: Yeah. It would gonna be
Kirk!

878
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,410
It would be-- he would get my
vote, honestly.

879
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:57,240
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. I vote for
Kirk too.

880
00:32:57,329 --> 00:32:58,410
Everybody vote for Kirk.

881
00:32:58,414 --> 00:33:01,799
Dan: All right. It is decided.
[Chuckles] K-kirk is favorite.

882
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,230
Alright. I mean, sh-should we,
like, finish the story if

883
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,250
people haven't heard this?

884
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,000
Bekah: [Laughs] I guess so.
Okay. So, Dan and I

885
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,440
work together.

886
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,880
Dan: So-- yes. And then the
shutdown happened, and all of my

887
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,000
clients stopped giving me work.
And so I had to stop

888
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,319
giving Bekah work. And then
something happened. I dunno.

889
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,900
Bekah: Yeah. Well, the- the day
that I

890
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,000
went and picked up my kids'
schoolwork cuz they said,

891
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
"Oh, you're going home--
they're going home

892
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,500
for three weeks," which they
never went back that year.

893
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:30,720
Dan: Yeah.

894
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,000
Bekah: Dan was like, "Hey, wanna
catch up?"

895
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,359
[Laughs] And I was like, "Oh,
no."

896
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:41,000
And it was, "Oh, no." So I--
when Dan hired me right

897
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,375
outta bootcamp, I hadn't had--
we didn't do an interview.

898
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,000
Like, we just had a
conversation.

899
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,075
Dan: Yeah.

900
00:33:48,285 --> 00:33:52,125
Bekah: And so I was now
interviewing for the first time,

901
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:52,800
really ever-

902
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,000
Dan: Yeah.

903
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,305
Bekah: -with four kids at home
that were trying to

904
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:58,545
be doing school at home. And it
was just miserable.

905
00:33:58,575 --> 00:34:01,575
Like, the interview process is
soul-crushing.

906
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:03,000
And I just found myself-- I was,
like, crying all

907
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,065
the time, every night. I'm like,
"This is awful."

908
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:12,480
And so, I finally, like,
remembered ... like, everything

909
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,190
I had gone through in trauma.
And I was like, "I

910
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,760
know you shouldn't be alone and
isolated in your feelings.

911
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,530
Does anybody wanna meet up for a
virtual coffee?"

912
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,000
And then people did. So I was
doing it, like, one

913
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,125
day a week. And then, it was at
East Coast time.

914
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:30,465
And then people were like, "What
about West Coast time?"

915
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:32,474
So then I added-- I was, like,
doing double sessions at

916
00:34:32,474 --> 00:34:35,000
one point. Like, Fridays, I was
doing in the morning,

917
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
taking a break for an hour or
two, and then

918
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
doing in the afternoon. And it
was-- it was not--

919
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,425
like, I'm an introvert. I- I- I
say I'm an introvert.

920
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,905
But I-- like, by that, I was,
like, I don't -- I enjoyed

921
00:34:46,905 --> 00:34:49,664
it, but I didn't, like, wanna
people anymore for, like,

922
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:51,500
the rest of the weekend. That
was just-

923
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:51,800
Dan: Yeah, yeah.

924
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,700
Bekah: -too intense. But

925
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,700
then, we just kept going. And,
like, people were like, "Hey,

926
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,000
why don't you have a Slack?" And
so I think Brian, initially,

927
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
is-- he was like, "Here's a
Slack." I'm like [chuckles],

928
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
"Okay." [Dan chuckles] And then
he was like,

929
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
"Let's do lunch and learns."
Okay. Then we did a newsletter,

930
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,199
and then I've always wanted a
podcast.

931
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,599
And Cameron, I think, was like,
"When are we

932
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,000
gonna do the podcast?" And you
were like,

933
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,300
"Let's do a podcast." So we
just-

934
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,000
Dan: Yeah.

935
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,590
Bekah: -kept going with it.

936
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:20,000
Dan: Yep.

937
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,340
Bekah: And Dan- Dan did hire me
back for a while.

938
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:23,699
Dan: Yeah.

939
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:24,690
Bekah: So--

940
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,000
Dan: As soon as I was able to, I
guess [??] [laughs].

941
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,500
Bekah: [Giggles] He only fired
me for a little bit.

942
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:29,949
Dan: Oh my god.

943
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:32,190
I didn't fire you. That's not
the right word.

944
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,769
You're using the word
incorrectly. I feel like-

945
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:35,710
Bekah: Oh. What is the
definition?

946
00:35:36,914 --> 00:35:38,925
Dan: I feel like, if you're
gonna fire somebody, it has to

947
00:35:38,925 --> 00:35:45,074
be for, like, a reason. Like a--
it's-- laid off is maybe

948
00:35:45,074 --> 00:35:46,700
what-- other-- like, probably
doesn't really apply to

949
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,864
contractors but, like,

950
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
that's closer to what it is,
right? Laid off means the

951
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,625
company has to stop, you know,
can't pay you anymore.

952
00:35:53,894 --> 00:35:55,875
Bekah: However you wanna justify
it in your head, Dan.

953
00:35:55,994 --> 00:36:02,000
Dan: Oh god. Whatever. [Bekah
chuckles] You better watch or

954
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,385
you're gonna get fired again,
cuz--

955
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,800
Bekah: You can't fire me
[chuckles]. I don't work for

956
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,070
you anymore.

957
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,219
Dan: I definitely can and I
will.

958
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,070
Bekah: You can't fire me if I
don't work for you.

959
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,380
Dan: You can't tell me-- don't
tell me my truth, okay?

960
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,500
Bekah: [All laugh] All right.
You go ahead, and you try, and

961
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,000
fire me, and see how that goes.
Are you-- are you firing me

962
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,489
as part of the pod- as your
podcast co-host?

963
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:32,324
Dan: No. I don't think a lot of
people would tune into

964
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:35,925
the Just Dan Podcast. Dan
Talks to Himself Podcast.

965
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:38,684
Bekah: I would tune into Dan
Talks to Himself Podcast.

966
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:41,114
Dan: Yeah, but you'd just heckle
me. So--

967
00:36:41,804 --> 00:36:43,600
Bekah: Yeah. I would probably
heckle you.

968
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,025
Dan: Yeah.

969
00:36:44,655 --> 00:36:46,485
Bekah: Well, tomorrow, when I
speak at PubConf, you're

970
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:47,385
allowed to heckle me though.

971
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:48,135
Dan: Yes.

972
00:36:48,614 --> 00:36:49,695
Bekah: Please. Heckle. Me.

973
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:53,000
Dan: I ... yes, I will.

974
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,500
Bekah: All right.

975
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,554
Dan: I-- are you glad or sad

976
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:02,474
that I didn't say-- yell
"Wuddup, Bek," at the

977
00:37:02,474 --> 00:37:03,914
beginning of your talk this
morning? I- I thought

978
00:37:03,914 --> 00:37:04,184
about it.

979
00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:10,000
Bekah: [Laughs] I- I- I think
I'm glad that you did not

980
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,724
do that.

981
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,565
Dan: Okay. Alright. I made the
right choice.

982
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,500
Bekah: I was already super
nervous.

983
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:12,800
Dan: Well, that's why--

984
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,695
Bekah: And then I--

985
00:37:13,784 --> 00:37:14,300
Dan: That's- that's why I didn't
do it, you know?

986
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,045
I didn't wanna--

987
00:37:15,045 --> 00:37:18,360
Bekah: Would've been very-- I'm
not really sure how-- what

988
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:18,989
would have happened.

989
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:19,600
Dan: Yeah. I- I just, like,
well, I mean, I

990
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,000
figured you would just break
into a laughing thing where you

991
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
couldn't stop laughing and which
would've been entertaining for

992
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,630
me, but probably not for you.
So--

993
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:28,150
Bekah: No.

994
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:29,000
Dan: I-- that's why-- I made
the right choice.

995
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,889
Bekah: And then I would've just
hid in a hole.

996
00:37:31,894 --> 00:37:32,550
Dan: I just wanted you to know,
I-

997
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,000
Bekah: I would've just, like,
stood behind-

998
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Dan: -I ... considered it.

999
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,369
Bekah: -the screen and then--

1000
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:37,949
Dan: I considered it and then
chose not to, you know?

1001
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:38,489
Bekah: Thank you.

1002
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:39,030
Dan: Yeah.

1003
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:40,889
Bekah: And thanks for being
there.

1004
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:43,949
Dan: Yeah. I feel like 10 years
ago, me would've done it.

1005
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:45,960
And then-- I mean, and then
realized it was a bad idea

1006
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,500
after, you know? But like- like
... wouldn't have put

1007
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,469
it together beforehand, you
know? That that was a bad

1008
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:52,679
idea?

1009
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:54,900
Bekah: I feel like the-- my
brothers definitely

1010
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,900
would have done that [chuckles].

1011
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,469
Dan: That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.

1012
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,789
Bekah: All right. We have more
questions.

1013
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:00,489
Dan: I'm learning. We do?

1014
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,730
Bekah: What does community mean
to you? [laughs]

1015
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,494
Dan: Community? I don't know.

1016
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,735
Bekah: I think community is a
group-- a group of

1017
00:38:12,735 --> 00:38:15,554
people that have some shared
sense of belonging.

1018
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:16,500
Dan: Mm-hmm. That's true.

1019
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:17,000
Bekah: And there can be
different degrees

1020
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,985
of that, right?

1021
00:38:17,985 --> 00:38:18,100
Dan: Yeah.

1022
00:38:17,985 --> 00:38:20,000
Bekah: Like, you- you all might,
like, to go hiking.

1023
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,195
And that can be a

1024
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:25,335
sense of community. Or it can be
people that are ... you know, I

1025
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:30,510
love true crime podcasts. So--
and actually my favorite

1026
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,309
podcasters—true crime
podcasters—live in Kansas City.

1028
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:32,600
Dan: Whoa.

1029
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,460
Bekah: So, I like-- thought
about trying to get them to

1030
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,650
come, like, "Can you come be
part of our live podcast?" But

1031
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,110
I wasn't sure how we were gonna
talk about murder and Virtual

1032
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:43,000
Coffee at the same time.
Although I have some--

1033
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,840
no. I'm not gonna take you down
that tangent.

1034
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,050
Dan: Oh, no.

1035
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,800
Bekah: Sorry [chuckles]. So--
yeah. So, some sense

1036
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,820
of belonging. And then there's
different degrees and ways

1037
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,000
of ... expressing that sense of
belonging.

1038
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,724
Dan: Yeah. I think that's great.
Yeah.

1039
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:01,304
And the other word that I would
use is connection, right?

1040
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:01,700
It is, like-

1041
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,000
Bekah: Yeah.

1042
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,985
Dan: -belonging and connection.

1043
00:39:02,985 --> 00:39:05,925
And maybe those-- maybe you
can't feel belonging

1044
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:08,500
without connection. I don't know
[chuckles]. But, like, you

1045
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,000
know, the- the-- that's the
other side of it is- is the--

1046
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,940
is connecting with people,
right? Like-- okay.

1047
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:21,300
So, like, I'm a Guardians fan,
you know? And ... I

1048
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,769
don't know. We were talking
about this last night,

1049
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:24,150
which- which is why it's in my
head. But, like, you

1050
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,860
know, your regional sports team,
lots of times, you're

1051
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,000
a fan of or whatever. And it--
the-- you, like, some- some

1052
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
sense of belonging from that,
right? It is like-

1053
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,300
Bekah: Yeah.

1054
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,489
Dan: -a ... whatever. You have
the hat or whatever, you know?

1055
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:34,000
Bekah: Yeah. And when I was in
the airport,

1056
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,239
there was somebody wearing WVU
tennis shoes in front of me.

1057
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:37,300
Dan: Yeah.

1058
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,800
Bekah: And, like, I graduated
from WVU.

1059
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,000
Dan: Yeah, yeah.

1060
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,860
Bekah: I taught there and it

1061
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,000
was like, "Oh," like, "that
guy's my friend."

1062
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,440
[Chuckles] I don't know that
guy.

1063
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:48,159
Dan: Right. Right. Right. And
you might connect, like, yeah.

1064
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:49,719
And that, like, creates a
connect- you know?

1065
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,329
And it creates a connection. I
mean, you were the

1066
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:52,960
only one. Cuz you didn't
probably say--

1067
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,500
Bekah: Yeah. No. I would thought
about saying, "Let's go,

1068
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,980
Mountaineers," but then I got a
little embarrassed. So I didn't.

1069
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,119
Dan: That's probably the right
call. So [laughs]--

1070
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,449
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah.

1071
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,675
Dan: My mom does stuff like
that, you know? I would like--

1072
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:06,735
the-- like, with- with the Ohio
state people, you know?

1073
00:40:06,914 --> 00:40:07,364
Bekah: Yeah!

1074
00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:09,195
Dan: It's not-- it's never fun
for me anyway [Bekah laughs].

1075
00:40:10,815 --> 00:40:14,414
[Chuckles] But ... yeah, I mean
that-- that's it. Like, right.

1076
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,000
The belonging is a great--
like, I think that's a great--

1077
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,485
I think

1078
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:19,545
that's like the- the- the real
key, you know? And then-- yeah.

1079
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,824
And then that sense of
connection is a-also of--

1080
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:25,005
Bekah: I was getting off the
escalator here, earlier.

1081
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:25,065
Dan: Yeah.

1082
00:40:25,065 --> 00:40:27,945
Bekah: And some guy was waving,
and I thought he was waving at

1084
00:40:27,974 --> 00:40:30,500
me. And then I, like, waved back
wholehartedly at him [laughs].

1085
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,800
He was, like, was actually
waving at the guy behind me.

1086
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,000
Dan: Yeah.

1087
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Bekah: Then I didn't feel like I
belonged.

1088
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,695
I felt very embarrassed for
myself [laughs].

1089
00:40:38,204 --> 00:40:40,784
Dan: You- you were not in his
community of- of waving people.

1090
00:40:40,994 --> 00:40:43,184
Bekah: I- I was not- not part of
that.

1091
00:40:43,635 --> 00:40:45,000
Dan: I-- it happens to me, like,
once a year [Bekah laughs] I'd

1092
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,500
say. It's really bad, you know?
Like, just like that?

1093
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,000
Yeah.

1094
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,755
Bekah: Yeah.

1095
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:53,000
Dan: Yeah. There's a lot of
people here. So, it's- it's

1096
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,295
easy to--

1097
00:40:53,295 --> 00:40:57,855
Bekah: Yeah. I hope he forgets
my face. Let's see here. Okay.

1098
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:58,000
Here's another question.

1099
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,264
Dan: [Chuckles] I hope he
forgets my face.

1100
00:41:00,284 --> 00:41:03,675
Bekah: At in-person events, what
are some techniques or

1101
00:41:03,675 --> 00:41:07,635
tactics you use for starting a
conversation with a stranger?

1102
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:11,235
I- I am, like, terrified of
talking with strangers. And I'm

1103
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,704
on booth duty while I'm here—for
work at DeepGram.

1104
00:41:14,804 --> 00:41:14,864
Dan: Yeah.

1105
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:16,875
Bekah: And I guess it almost
makes it a little

1106
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:19,195
bit easier cuz I'm like, "I'm
deep- part of DeepGram.

1107
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:20,925
We're a speech to text API
company." So at least, like, I

1108
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:26,000
can do the spiel. But sometimes
I don't-- I told

1109
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,215
a woman I liked her glasses
[chuckles].

1110
00:41:29,545 --> 00:41:30,364
Dan: What's wrong with that?

1111
00:41:30,644 --> 00:41:32,534
Bekah: No. That's how I get to
talk to people.

1112
00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:33,164
Dan: Oh, sure. Yeah. Oh, yeah,
yeah.

1113
00:41:33,164 --> 00:41:34,125
Bekah: Give them a compliment.

1114
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,735
Dan: Sure. Yeah, yeah. But I
would say only

1115
00:41:36,735 --> 00:41:38,835
compliment, yeah, clothes and-
and stuff, right? Like--

1116
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:41,175
Bekah: Yeah. You have to be
careful what you compliment.

1117
00:41:41,175 --> 00:41:42,000
Dan: Especially-- I mean,
especially if you're not a

1118
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,394
wom- if you're not a woman.

1119
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:44,300
Bekah: Yeah. Don't be like--

1120
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,000
Dan: It's just, like, don't--

1121
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Bekah: You have really nice
eyes.

1122
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Dan: [Chuckles] No, yeah.

1123
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Bekah: That will get creepy.

1124
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Dan: That's ... yeah. Yeah-- no.
I don't have

1125
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,994
any good strategies cuz I'm
really bad at it [laughs] also.

1126
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,349
I'd say, one- one strategy--

1127
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:57,630
Bekah: You talk to people at the
table-- lunch table.

1129
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,900
Dan: Sure. Sort of.

1130
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,000
Bekah: Yeah.

1131
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Dan: I mean, they were talking

1132
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,700
to me [laughs]. Alright. What I
was gonna say was, if you go

1133
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,000
with a friend, you know?

1134
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,300
Bekah: Yeah.

1135
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,000
Dan: It's much easier to
actually

1136
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
talk to other people if you ha-
already have somebody

1137
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,500
that you're, like, with-- you
do know because, like, we

1138
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,000
sat-- Bekah and I sat next to
each other at the lunch table

1139
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,420
and then, like, other people
just sat down, you know?

1140
00:42:18,425 --> 00:42:21,329
And we weren't ... like ... I
don't know.

1141
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,019
And then they-- we just, like,
started chat, you know?

1142
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:26,190
And- and that's cool. It's ...
again, also hard for me

1143
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:27,269
[chuckles]. I'm not-- I'm not
good at it.

1144
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:27,719
Bekah: Yeah.

1145
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,405
Dan: I-- they're-- here, at
this conference, they're doing,

1146
00:42:30,405 --> 00:42:33,405
like, a Bingo thing where
they're trying to get you to

1147
00:42:33,405 --> 00:42:36,224
go to all the speaker table--
or the sponsor booths, that you

1148
00:42:36,224 --> 00:42:39,704
can see some of them is behind
us. And-- so you have, like,

1149
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:40,000
this little card, and you get
little stamps, you know, and

1150
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,500
if you get 'em all, you get
entered in something. Raffle

1151
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,775
for ... I don't know what.

1152
00:42:44,835 --> 00:42:45,255
Bekah: Yeah, I don't know.

1153
00:42:45,284 --> 00:42:47,614
Dan: But, anyway, so now I'm
going to all these

1154
00:42:47,614 --> 00:42:49,000
booths that I don't have any
interest [chuckles] in going

1155
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,085
to and trying

1156
00:42:50,085 --> 00:42:54,300
to, like, make conversations.
Like, I feel bad just

1157
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,500
being, like, stamp my thing,
okay, bye, you know?

1158
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,295
And so, I'm always like, "So,
what do you guys do [laughs]?"

1159
00:42:59,804 --> 00:43:01,605
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah, we got a lot
of that in our booth.

1160
00:43:01,605 --> 00:43:02,000
Dan: I'm like- like--

1161
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,474
Bekah: I'm like, "It's okay.

1162
00:43:02,474 --> 00:43:04,034
You don't have to talk to me if
you don't want to."

1163
00:43:04,034 --> 00:43:05,355
Dan: Yeah. Well, one of the
people was like, "Have you heard

1164
00:43:05,355 --> 00:43:10,065
of us?" I'm like, "No,
[inaudible]. I haven't." I--

1165
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:10,815
Bekah: That's awkward.

1166
00:43:10,994 --> 00:43:13,769
Dan: And, like-- also, I'm not
looking for a job. And that's

1167
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:15,630
one of the, like, a lot of these
people are here to hire.

1168
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:19,000
Which makes a lot of sense.
But, like ... I probably

1169
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
wouldn't-- I don't know if this
is a common thing to,

1170
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,380
like, get your thing stamped at
every booth thing.

1171
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:28,860
But, like, I imagine that a lot
of these booths are used to

1172
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,510
the people that come up are the
people that are looking for

1173
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,429
jobs. Because that's the reason
they're- they're here, you know?

1174
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:32,500
Bekah: Yeah.

1175
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:36,000
Dan: And I'm like, "No, I
don't." They're like, "Whoa, we

1176
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
have some positions available in
front-end." And I'm like, "Yeah,

1177
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,525
I'm good," [laughs] you know?
Like, I don't know what to say.

1178
00:43:42,974 --> 00:43:47,565
I don't-- I'm like-- I don't
have the ... I dunno. I could

1179
00:43:47,565 --> 00:43:51,764
feel like a lot of people are
just good at ... saying things

1180
00:43:51,824 --> 00:43:54,135
in ways that make sense to
people [chuckles]? I dunno.

1181
00:43:55,005 --> 00:43:56,684
Bekah: My dad, like, loves
talking to strangers.

1182
00:43:56,715 --> 00:43:58,695
I talked to a stranger in the
airport and I texted him like,

1183
00:43:58,695 --> 00:44:02,775
"Dad, you'll be so proud of me.
This- this guy used

1184
00:44:02,775 --> 00:44:04,815
to live in Pittsburgh, now he
lives in Atlanta, and

1185
00:44:04,815 --> 00:44:06,000
he's been there for 10 years,
and I had that whole

1186
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
conversation all by myself."

1187
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,875
Dan: That's impressive, yeah.

1188
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,614
Bekah: And he was like, "Isn't
that amazing?"

1189
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:11,954
And I was like, "No, Dad. [Dan
laughs] It's not. I don't wanna

1190
00:44:11,954 --> 00:44:13,005
do that all the time." I mean,
the guy was really

1191
00:44:13,005 --> 00:44:17,000
nice, and- and I would've had of
more conversation with him,

1192
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,355
but--

1193
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,059
Dan: No, I- I didn't--

1194
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:21,030
Bekah: I think, like, getting
involved too. Like, if

1195
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:24,329
you're a speaker, then people
will talk to you?

1196
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,550
So, that's a good way to do it?

1197
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:30,600
Dan: Yeah. I mean, like-- yeah.
And that's-- I'd say, the

1198
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,809
other times that I've had fun at
conferences,

1199
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:36,000
I've been with the speakers. Not
because I was a speaker

1200
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
necessarily but, like, I just
either knew the

1201
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,059
organizers or whatever.

1202
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:39,119
Bekah: Yeah.

1203
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,489
Dan: And, like-- or just-- there-
there was one event in Florida

1204
00:44:41,489 --> 00:44:44,534
that I went to, where they just
had their after party, whatever.

1205
00:44:44,534 --> 00:44:47,414
And all-- of course, all the
speakers were there, and I- I

1206
00:44:47,414 --> 00:44:50,000
just kinda, like, tagged along,
[chuckles], you know, and

1207
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
ended up at a smaller thing. And
that's, like-- for me, I-

1208
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I always-- I do much better in
smaller, like, settings,

1209
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,215
you know? Like, smaller groups
of people or whatever.

1210
00:44:58,215 --> 00:45:03,295
And so ... yeah. I'd- I'd say
... to go back to the

1211
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,500
original question, right? Your
strategies for

1212
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,000
this sort of thing.

1213
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,300
Bekah: Yeah.

1214
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,275
Dan: My main strategy is bring-
bring your friend.

1215
00:45:08,114 --> 00:45:09,284
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. It is really
good.

1216
00:45:09,284 --> 00:45:13,184
Last year, at KCDC, James Quick
was here. And I just, like,

1217
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:15,735
followed him around, like,
everywhere. With--

1218
00:45:16,094 --> 00:45:17,000
Dan: Yeah. That's what I-- that's
what I told Bekah I was gonna

1219
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
do to Bekah. Except that she's
just sitting in this

1220
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,045
booth the whole time [chuckles].
And that's less fun.

1221
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:21,784
Bekah: Not the whole time.

1222
00:45:22,085 --> 00:45:22,664
Dan: No, not the whole time.

1223
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:23,000
Bekah: Some of the time I'm not.

1224
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:23,700
Dan: Obviously right now-

1225
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,500
Bekah: And now I'm podcasting.

1226
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,155
Dan: -you're sitting right here-

1227
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:25,695
Bekah: Yeah.

1228
00:45:25,695 --> 00:45:26,204
Dan: -which is cool.

1229
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:27,855
Bekah: I gotta go back to the
booth after this though.

1230
00:45:27,855 --> 00:45:28,605
Dan: Right. Yes. Yep.

1231
00:45:28,605 --> 00:45:31,545
Bekah: But then tomorrow, I'm
free in the afternoon.

1232
00:45:31,574 --> 00:45:33,454
Dan: Yeah. What was that?

1233
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:37,000
Bekah: Yeah. So, I would say
bringing

1234
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
your friend is nice. And it--
or it doesn't even have to be

1235
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,500
like a 'friend' friend. Just put
it out there on Twitter

1236
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,820
or whatever social media, like,
"Hey, is anybody going?

1237
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,690
Want to meet up?"

1238
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,600
Dan: Yeah. Yep. That's another

1239
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:54,150
good strategy as well. Yeah, I
did the same thing-

1240
00:45:54,179 --> 00:45:54,500
Bekah: Yeah.

1241
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,019
Dan: -with Rizél. I was trying
to get

1242
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:57,000
her to come find us as lunch.
Cuz she was-

1243
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,000
Bekah: Yeah.

1244
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Dan: -she was at your talk and
I didn't know that.

1245
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,600
And I probably missed her but,
anyway--

1246
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,389
Bekah: It- it is hard when
you're by yourself.

1247
00:46:03,449 --> 00:46:04,000
I- I mean-

1248
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,300
Dan: Yeah. I--

1249
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,070
Bekah: -I've been to conferences
that were

1250
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:09,000
terrible experiences. Because,
like, there one-- I

1251
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,039
can't remember which one it was.
Within the last year.

1252
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,079
Like, I would go sit down at the
lunch table and people

1253
00:46:13,085 --> 00:46:15,179
would just, like, [laughs] stand
up and walk away. And then I'd

1254
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:16,500
just be sitting there by myself.

1255
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,000
Dan: Yeah.

1256
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,960
Bekah: I'm like, "Oh ... all
right.

1257
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:20,800
I'm just gonna continue to sit
here-

1258
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,090
Dan: Yeah.

1259
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:21,739
Bekah: -by myself."

1260
00:46:21,769 --> 00:46:23,000
Dan: Yeah, yeah. No. I-- when
I'm-- when I-

1261
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,700
I've-- I think I've only gone
to one, like, big conference

1262
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,710
by myself. And I just turned
into like a ball person.

1263
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:31,199
Like, I honestly, like, put my
headphones on, I'd read my book,

1264
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:33,719
like, or something, you know?
Put my, like, op- open my

1265
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:36,510
computer. I-- I'm not good at
it. That's why it's nice

1266
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,010
to have a friend, you know?

1267
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:40,619
Bekah: The other thing would be
you can talk

1268
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:41,600
to speakers, you know?

1269
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:41,800
Dan: Yeah.

1270
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,000
Bekah: So if you are there by
yourself,

1271
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,700
then go up to the speaker and-

1272
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,000
Dan: Yeah.

1273
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,500
Bekah: -talk or, like, what--
our-

1274
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,070
our badges say if we're speakers
or- or not

1275
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:53,730
and what company ... oh, mine
doesn't say what

1276
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:56,670
company I'm with. Maybe cuz I'm
a speaker.

1277
00:46:56,699 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm not really sure. Does yours?

1278
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,300
Dan: No.

1279
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,929
Bekah: No. Yours says attendee.

1280
00:47:00,929 --> 00:47:02,000
Dan: I'm an attendee--

1281
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,050
Bekah: Well, you can just go up
to him and be like, "So, I see

1282
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:05,099
you're an attendee too."
[laughs]

1283
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:08,000
Dan: [Laughs] Yeah. That's the
kind of thing

1284
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
that I imagine saying. And then,
you know,

1285
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,179
realize it's a bad idea, and
then, you know--

1286
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:13,769
Bekah: Jokes are a good way.

1287
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:16,079
Just go up to somebody random
and tell them a joke-

1288
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,139
Dan: I never remember jokes.
[Inaudible].

1289
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:17,280
Bekah: -I think that's a good
idea.

1290
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:23,280
Dan: I-- my- my- father-in-law
is the same

1291
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,349
way I think i-is your Dad but--
and he'll do the same thing.

1292
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:27,449
He'll do-- drop a joke or, like,
just random, you know,

1293
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:31,000
thing, or make a comment. And,
like-- one time, he-- one

1294
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
time, he was-- this is on-- we
were on vacation, heard a

1295
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
lady talking to her friend at
the grocery store and was--

1296
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,769
like, she was telling some-- it
wasn't like a personal--

1297
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:42,449
it was a personal story but not
like a-- not like

1298
00:47:42,449 --> 00:47:44,000
a, you know, private story.

1299
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,300
Bekah: Yeah.

1300
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,500
Dan: But, like-- and then saw
her at some other

1301
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,700
store, like, later, and he was
like, "Hey, how about that

1303
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,744
thingy thing," you know?

1304
00:47:50,925 --> 00:47:51,585
Bekah: Oh, that's creepy!
[Laughs]

1305
00:47:52,344 --> 00:47:53,925
Dan: Oh, yeah, I know. I'm like,
"That's a horrible act."

1306
00:47:54,224 --> 00:47:56,000
And he's like, "Yeah. And she-
she acted kind

1307
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,715
of weird about it." [All laugh]
I'm like, "Yeah, no kidding,

1308
00:47:59,715 --> 00:48:03,000
man." So, don't do that. I'd
say.

1309
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,500
Bekah: No.

1310
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,635
Dan: Yeah. I mean--

1311
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:07,000
Bekah: That's why I bolt my door
shut-

1312
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,300
Dan: Right [laughs].

1313
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,795
Bekah: -in the hotel. And stack
up furniture against the door.

1314
00:48:09,795 --> 00:48:11,000
Dan: And he's not creepy. That's
the-- that's the

1315
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
thing, you know? He's just,
like ... he thought it

1316
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
would be funny, you know? And
... it wasn't.

1317
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Bekah: That's not.

1318
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,094
Dan: He didn't keep following
her. So--

1319
00:48:21,644 --> 00:48:23,000
Bekah: [Laughs] Sorry again a
year later and brought

1320
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,804
it up again?

1321
00:48:24,755 --> 00:48:25,784
Dan: Right. Showed up at her
house.

1322
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:31,815
Anyway ... sorry, Phil. [Bekah
laughs] That was-- I love you.

1323
00:48:31,815 --> 00:48:35,190
Bekah: Um--

1324
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:36,179
Dan: Do we have any more
questions, or--

1325
00:48:36,269 --> 00:48:38,000
Bekah: Okay. Travis followed up,
"But I

1326
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
always like slapping language
and framework stickers on

1327
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
things, but they seem better for
keeping the conversation

1328
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,389
going than starting it." Yeah.
That can be a good way to do it.

1329
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,690
Dan: What? What? What?

1330
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,960
Bekah: Like, language or
framework stickers? Like,

1331
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,210
talking

1332
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:58,619
about those things that you do?
Like, as a conversation starter.

1333
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,539
Like, if my water bottle had a-

1334
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:01,239
Dan: Oh--

1335
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:03,000
Bekah: -React sticker on it--

1336
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Dan: Talk to me about React
stuff and that kinda thing?

1337
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Bekah: "Oh, you know React too.
Hey."

1338
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,800
Dan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay,
okay.

1339
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,200
Bekah: Yeah.

1340
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:07,769
Dan: That's cool.

1341
00:49:08,429 --> 00:49:12,554
Yeah. I-- yeah. That's a good
idea.

1342
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:19,905
I was-- [chuckles] I started
talking about Tailwind to one of

1343
00:49:19,905 --> 00:49:21,735
the sponsor booths that I was
having random conversations

1344
00:49:21,735 --> 00:49:25,574
with, and I- I-- pretty sure I
bored them cuz I just, like,

1345
00:49:25,574 --> 00:49:27,000
saw their eyes crossing
[laughs]. Not bored them but,

1346
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,394
like, I went off on a

1347
00:49:28,394 --> 00:49:31,000
Tailwind tangent. And they were
not interested in

1348
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
that content [laughs]. So
[inaudible].

1349
00:49:33,195 --> 00:49:35,235
Bekah: You can also go up to
each of the booths and

1350
00:49:35,235 --> 00:49:37,155
practice a different accent.

1351
00:49:37,605 --> 00:49:37,695
Dan: Ooh.

1352
00:49:38,284 --> 00:49:40,304
Bekah: So, try the same
conversation-

1353
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:40,824
Dan: [With thick accent] Oh, ya.

1354
00:49:40,905 --> 00:49:43,094
Bekah: -in a different accent
every time [laughs].

1355
00:49:43,755 --> 00:49:44,500
Dan: I was-- how- how many
accents? What ac- what accent

1356
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,244
do you got? What's your-- what's
your go to--

1357
00:49:46,244 --> 00:49:48,315
Bekah: Oh, I don't do-- I can't
do any accents.

1358
00:49:48,324 --> 00:49:49,000
Dan: [With accent] You can't do
any accents?

1359
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,200
Bekah: No.

1360
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,954
Dan: [With accent] You can't do
a German accent?

1361
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:52,000
Bekah: No!

1362
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,525
Dan: What about-- what about,
like, Arnold [Schwarzenegger]--

1363
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:58,244
Bekah: Ambrose is really good.
He's been practicing his British

1364
00:49:58,244 --> 00:49:58,724
accent.

1365
00:49:59,105 --> 00:49:59,800
Dan: At the-- "[With Arnold's
accent] Get to

1366
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,000
the chopper," you know? "[With
Arnold's accent] We need

1367
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,500
to do the-- we need to add the

1368
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:09,210
React to the Remix. Now! Bekah!"
[laughs]

1369
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,170
Bekah: I'm not-- I'm not gonna
try.

1370
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,699
I'm not even. I was thinking
about it.

1371
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:14,159
Like, "I think I can do that." I
can't do that.

1372
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:16,889
Dan: Every time I think I can
speak

1373
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,090
in a British accent, it does not
go well.

1374
00:50:18,094 --> 00:50:19,800
I- I feel like I need to get
warmed up on a British

1375
00:50:19,804 --> 00:50:20,099
accent.

1376
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:22,000
Bekah: I like mixed British and
Australian-

1377
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,000
Dan: Well- well, I'm not saying
of-- oh my god.

1378
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Bekah: -but I hear that that is
not uncommon.

1379
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Like, my coworker, my teammate
is ... he is from England.

1380
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,300
Dan: Uh-huh.

1381
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,000
Bekah: And he said whenever
he's in

1382
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,565
the US, people either think he's
from Australia or England.

1383
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:38,000
They're not usually really sure.
And he asked the-- one of

1384
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
the people when we were
together, she was like,

1385
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,315
"Oh, that accent." He was like,
"Where do you think I'm from?"

1386
00:50:42,315 --> 00:50:45,525
And she was like, "It's either
British or Australian."

1387
00:50:45,525 --> 00:50:47,385
[Dan laughs] He was like, "Yep."

1388
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:51,885
Dan: Yeah. I had-- when I--
when-- I went to

1389
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:58,275
Scotlands, like, a long time ago
... before kids.

1390
00:50:59,324 --> 00:51:01,545
So, more than six years ago
[chuckles]-- I don't know.

1391
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:03,000
I don't know how much more--
but-- no, I really

1392
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
practiced it when I was there. I
had-- I felt like I had a

1393
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
pretty good Scottish-- go--
oh, no. It's pass the thing.

1394
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
[Silence] I think-- I think it
keeps recording. I think it's

1395
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,335
just a screensaver.

1396
00:51:15,335 --> 00:51:16,835
I think it keeps recording when
it does that. But

1397
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,000
I didn't wanna risk it. Anyway
... yeah, I had a good

1398
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,275
Scottish accent going for a
while.

1399
00:51:21,635 --> 00:51:23,500
Learned some good words too.
Have you heard the

1400
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,034
word 'shuggled'?

1401
00:51:24,784 --> 00:51:25,114
Bekah: What?

1402
00:51:25,155 --> 00:51:28,715
Dan: Shuggled. Shuggled is like
... shaken, you know?

1403
00:51:28,894 --> 00:51:28,954
Bekah: Oh.

1404
00:51:28,954 --> 00:51:31,934
Dan: Like- like shooken up, you
know? As a bus driver was

1405
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,545
driving over some bumpy stuff
and then-- and- and she was

1406
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:37,000
like-- something about, "Sorry
to keep you all shuggled,"

1407
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,275
or something. [Laughs]

1408
00:51:38,894 --> 00:51:40,574
It was-- it was really fun. I
like accents.

1409
00:51:40,605 --> 00:51:42,195
I'm not, like, good at
practicing them, but ...

1410
00:51:42,344 --> 00:51:44,700
that's a good idea.

1411
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,284
Bekah: Yeah.

1412
00:51:45,775 --> 00:51:46,300
Dan: Alright.

1413
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,059
Bekah: Practice your accents.

1414
00:51:47,059 --> 00:51:49,244
Dan: I feel like the German one
is my go-to.

1415
00:51:49,514 --> 00:51:50,000
Bekah: That's a good one.

1416
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,545
Dan: It's like a ... quirky
German. Do you know it?

1417
00:51:52,844 --> 00:51:53,465
Bekah: Quirky German [laughs]?

1418
00:51:53,469 --> 00:51:54,614
Dan: Yeah. Not like a serious
German.

1419
00:51:54,795 --> 00:51:57,000
There's, like, serious German.
And there's, like, you

1420
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
know ... fun, silly German. It's
like Hans and Franz, you

1421
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,505
know, from "Saturday Night
Live"?

1422
00:52:02,804 --> 00:52:03,224
Bekah: Mm-mm.

1423
00:52:03,224 --> 00:52:03,554
Dan: Bekah.

1424
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:08,025
Bekah: "Saturday Night Live" is
on too late.

1425
00:52:09,315 --> 00:52:12,045
Dan: I mean, it's from when we
were, like, kids. So it's not,

1426
00:52:12,434 --> 00:52:12,704
like-- nothing very much live--

1427
00:52:13,065 --> 00:52:13,961
Bekah: I only know the
cheerleaders.

1428
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:15,300
Dan: The cheerleaders?

1429
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:15,500
Bekah: Yeah.

1430
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,050
Dan: Like [inaudible]--

1431
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,700
Bekah: [Soft cheering] Tacos.
Burritos. What's coming outta

1432
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,019
your speedos [Dan laughs].

1433
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,329
There's Bobby Fisher. Where is
he? I don't know.

1434
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:25,000
I don't know. Yeah.

1435
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Dan: Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember
that one. That's a good one.

1436
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,000
Bekah: That-- those-- and

1437
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,440
get off the shed. I used to like
that.

1438
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:32,400
That was Chris Farley, I think?

1439
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:37,000
Dan: I don't know that one. But
anyway, we've gone-

1440
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,469
Bekah: Yes.

1441
00:52:37,469 --> 00:52:40,469
Dan: -way off the beaten path
here [laughs]. Thanks, Travis.

1442
00:52:40,469 --> 00:52:41,369
I'm blaming with Travis for that
one.

1443
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:41,610
Bekah: Yeah.

1444
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:44,565
Dan: Alright. Is that the last-

1445
00:52:44,565 --> 00:52:45,000
Bekah: I think I-- we're-

1446
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,300
Dan: -question?

1447
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,284
Bekah: -that-- we've covered
everything.

1448
00:52:48,614 --> 00:52:55,000
Dan: Okay. Alright. I was kind
of ... expecting

1449
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,554
some of our friends to stop by
and say hi, but nobody did.

1450
00:52:57,735 --> 00:52:59,655
Bekah: Well, it's also really
hard to hear.

1451
00:53:00,014 --> 00:53:01,800
Dan: Well, sure. But I thought
they would coming--

1452
00:53:00,525 --> 00:53:02,894
Bekah: And I know that they're
at talk-- number

1453
00:53:02,894 --> 00:53:04,155
of them are at talks. So--

1454
00:53:05,445 --> 00:53:08,025
Dan: Yeah. Alright, cool. Well,
this was ... fun.

1455
00:53:08,204 --> 00:53:10,605
Bekah: This was an excellent
in-person-

1456
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:11,500
Dan: I hope that the--

1457
00:53:10,784 --> 00:53:11,864
Bekah: -podcast experience.

1458
00:53:11,864 --> 00:53:13,500
Dan: Yes. It was excellent. I'm
sorry that we weren't

1459
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,875
able to live stream it. But ...
well, if you listen to this--

1460
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:17,534
Bekah: We did our best.

1461
00:53:17,534 --> 00:53:19,065
Dan: If you listened to this,
then I've already published it.

1462
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:20,715
So I don't need to talk about
when I'm gonna publish it.

1463
00:53:20,715 --> 00:53:21,284
Bekah: Yes.

1464
00:53:21,405 --> 00:53:23,445
Dan: [Playful] Cool. Cool, cool.
Co-cool, cool, cool.

1465
00:53:23,835 --> 00:53:26,300
Bekah: All right. And we'll be
back next week with another

1466
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:26,594
podcast [laughs].

1467
00:53:26,985 --> 00:53:29,000
Dan: I don't-- I'm-- yeah. I'm
having some technical issues

1468
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
with Descript and trying to get
that last-- trying to get

1469
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Bogdan's out. So--

1470
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,144
Bekah:  Yeah. So if anybody
works at Descript--

1471
00:53:34,425 --> 00:53:37,005
Dan: Yep. Hopefully, we'll get
that sorted out soon.

1472
00:53:37,635 --> 00:53:39,074
Bekah: Oh, actually I know
