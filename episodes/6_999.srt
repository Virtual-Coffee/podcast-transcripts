00:00:08,294 --> 00:00:11,925
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello and
welcome to Season 6 of the

2
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:15,824
Virtual Coffee podcast.
We are live and in person

3
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:21,089
at Kansas City Developers
Conference. This should be our

4
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:21,000
50th- 50th episode of the
podcast, but we had some

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
technical difficulties and-

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,089
Dan Ott: This is the 49th.

5
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,149
Bekah: This is the 49th. But
we're

6
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:27,000
gonna pretend like it's very
special-

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Dan: I mean --

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,559
Bekah: -and that it is the 50th.

7
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,719
Dan Ott: Sure. Yeah.
Well, if we publish it-

8
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:30,725
Bekah: Yeah.

8
00:00:30,725 --> 00:00:31,230
Dan: -after, then it will --

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,570
Bekah: So this is definitely

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,990
the 50th episode of the Virtual
Coffee podcast [laughs]. And --

11
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:40,320
Dan: Here with me today --

12
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:43,000
Bekah: [Laughs] Here with me
today is my cohost, Dan.

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,659
Dan: Wwwuddup, Bek? How's it
going?

13
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:46,700
Bekah: Hey, it's going --

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,200
Dan: Yeah?

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,729
Bekah: It's going good.

14
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:49,000
Done with my talk, and I'm
very happy to --

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,130
Dan: She did great.

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,000
Bekah: I -- it [crosstalk]
wasn't my best [crosstalk]

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,679
performance.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,700
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. No, it was
good.

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,000
Bekah: No.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,659
Dan: I saw it. You didn't-

17
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:55,000
Bekah: It happened.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Dan: -you didn't see it.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,939
Bekah: It was okay.

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,000
Dan: You can't --

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,700
Bekah: So people got up and left

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,590
during my talk and then
I -- it was very thrown off.

20
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:02,000
Dan: I feel like they just --

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,300
Bekah: And I said something that
was funny and nobody laughed.

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,000 
Dan: I laughed.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,219
Bekah: And then I was

22
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:07,439
like, "Oh. I'm not really
funny [chuckles]."

23
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,319
Dan: Yeah. Bekah did a
great job at her at talk.

24
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:13,900
Todd, we-

24
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,370
Bekah: I did an okay talk.

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,019
Dan: -another Virtual Coffee
member, Todd, I saw his talk

26
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:18,900
right before yours.
That was also really good.

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,790
Bekah: Yeah.

27
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,000
Dan: But Tom Cudd is-

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Bekah: Tom is --

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,825
Dan: -to- tomorrow, I think.

30
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:24,700
Bekah: Tomorrow.

28
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,000
Dan: Who else?

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Bekah: Chris DeMars.

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,000
Dan: Chris is now, I think,

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,420
actually [chuckles].

30
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:30,700
Bekah: Yeah.

31
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,200
Dan: Sorry, Chris.

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,000
Bekah: Yeah.

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Dan: Yeah.

30
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,000
Bekah: Yeah. This has been good.
We got up and got to do

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,620
in-person coffee this morning,
which was a lot of fun.

32
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,310
And now we're gonna be answering
some of the questions that

33
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,300
you all submitted. And I think-

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,300
Dan: Yeah!

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,750
Bekah: -we'll do it soon.

34
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,700
Dan: Yeah! We
were supposed to do this live.

35
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,909
But ... there's no wifi here.
That's good. So we're recording.

36
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:54,000
We're gonna publish it.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Bekah: Yes.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,680
Dan: In a little bit.

37
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:57,300
Bekah: Yeah. So --

38
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,000
Dan: Some time.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Bekah: Alright.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,500
Dan: Alright.

41
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,349
Bekah: Ready to get started
with some questions?

38
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:01,800
Dan: I guess so.

00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,540
Bekah: So, so we've got some
anonymous questions.

39
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,000
I've only viewed one of them

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,530
and the others we
have not viewed at all.

41
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:10,000
So we'll see what those are.
And we have some that are

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,500
not anonymous and we'll
go through those as well.

43
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,000
Dan: Okay. Sounds good.

43
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:19,289
Bekah: The- the first question
is an anonymous one. And it is,

44
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,060
what time do you go to sleep?

45
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,000
Dan: Hmm.
I try to go to sleep like

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,030
10-ish most days, you know?

47
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:31,724
Bekah: Yeah, I feel like
that's also what I go for.

48
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:36,465
Last night, we said we
would go to sleep at 11.

49
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:37,995
Dan: Well, you said that. I
never promised anything.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,115
Bekah: Okay. Well, I said, Dan,
I'll meet you from 10 to 11-

51
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:41,594
Dan: Mm-hmm.

51
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,000
Bekah: -and then we stayed up
later.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,500
Dan:  Yep. Well, we had
catching

53
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,700
up to do and my plane
got delayed to infinity.

54
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,700
And so, I finally made it.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,314
Bekah: Yeah.

55
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:51,700
Dan: And Bekah --

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,775
Bekah: And then somebody
challenged

56
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:56,205
my ability to weight lift.
And ... then I- I had to take

57
00:02:56,205 --> 00:02:56,715
care of that.

58
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:57,000
Dan: Well, he wasn't
challenging your ability.

00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,900
He was challenging, like,

59
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,500
your form, which is, I
think even more-

60
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,700
Bekah: Yeah!

61
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,854
Dan: -ridiculous. He was
like [inaudible] --

60
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:02,500
Bekah: He was like, "Is this --
how do you -- show me how

61
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,294
you..." How dare you? First
of all [chuckles] --

61
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:07,514
Dan: [Laughs] I just don't
think he knew who

62
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,500
he was talking to, you know?

63
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:07,800
Bekah: No.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,365
Dan: Yeah.

63
00:03:08,985 --> 00:03:11,115
Bekah: Yeah. Don't challenge
my weightlift form.

64
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:12,604
Don't mansplain my
deadlift.

65
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:15,854
Dan: Especially not at 11.45
a night at a- at a- at a bar.

67
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:18,944
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah.
It all ended peacefully though.

68
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:20,985
I am happy to report. I did --

69
00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:23,000
Dan: Yep. She deadlifted that
guy. And then, you know,

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
threw him into the street? I
don't know [laughs].

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,354
Bekah: Uh-huh. Yep, exactly.

72
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,694
That's exactly what I did.
I did not.

73
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:33,074
I was very kind to him.
Maybe. I can't promise. Okay.

74
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:36,000
All right. Alright.
Let me -- let's go with the

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,715
anonymous questions first.

76
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:40,455
Dan: Wait. Who? Wait. Was that
first one anonymous?

77
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,300
Bekah: That was an anonymous one.

00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,000
Dan: It was in your notebook?

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,600
Bekah: Yeah, because I
wrote it down before, okay?

00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,000
Dan: Oh, you looked and-

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,500
Bekah: Cuz I was-

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Dan: -wrote it down. Okay.

79
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,430
Bekah: -afraid it was gonna
disappear. I never used this

80
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,600
anonymous app thing before.
And so I wasn't sure,

81
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,800
like, I opened it, now,
is this like Snapchat?

82
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,949
And it goes away after
50 seconds or something?

83
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm not sure how Snapchat works.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,560
Dan: Yeah. Technology. I have
no idea.

84
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,219
Bekah: All right. So I hope that
these are all ... appropriate.

85
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,000
Well, that one says Netflix
and chill, so --

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,930
Dan: Well, hey.

86
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:10,700
Bekah: That's --

87
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,000
Dan: Just --

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Bekah: There we go.

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,300
Dan: Nope.

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,454
Bekah: Please give me pickup
lines that always work [laughs].

88
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:20,000
Dan: Well, that's not a
question. So --

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Bekah: That's a demand. We
don't-

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Dan: They failed- they
failed the --

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,404
Bekah: We don't negotiate.

90
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,254
Dan: I mean, just read
the instructions, people.

91
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:28,245
[Bekah chuckles] It's not hard.
We were looking for

92
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:30,194
questions, not demands.

93
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:33,700
Bekah: All right. Here we go.
What extra work goes

94
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,000
into landing a full-time
international remote role

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,500
as a first role out of
webdev bootcamp, with no

96
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,399
prior developer experience?
That's a really good question.

97
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,110
I feel like this is
something that we talk a

98
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,700
lot about at Virtual Coffee.
Maybe not so much the landing

99
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,700
an international remote
role, because that's a

100
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,000
little bit more challenging.
Not all companies can work

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,700
internationally. So you really
need to narrow it down to

102
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,720
see what companies allow for
international remote work.

103
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,000
Dan: Right. Yeah.
And- and- and those points

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,700
you're gonna have to start
looking and see if the companies

105
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,800
have, like, supported visa stuff
and, you know, lawyers to

106
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
help you, things like that.
There's a lot of like ... laws

107
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,000
and rules and things that
can come into play, I think,

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,550
with international stuff, right?

109
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,540
Bekah: Yeah, for sure.

110
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,319
Dan: But if you set that-
that part of it aside

111
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,800
a little bit, right?
What kind of stuff can we

112
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,254
do, coming out of bootcamp,
to, like, land your first job?

113
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:33,045
Bekah: Yeah. I was just talking
to someone about this recently.

114
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:35,685
She's gonna be learning how
to code in a couple of months.

115
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:41,000
She's a- a mom of a couple of
kids. And I- I think that once

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
you're getting close to applying
for jobs, working with other

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,500
people and building projects
together is something that

118
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,700
can really help you stand
apart-

119
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,000
Dan: Yeah.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Bekah: -because there's a lot

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,700
of people coming out of
bootcamps right now. But a lot

120
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,000
of them

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,319
have experience where they've
just worked on their own stuff.

121
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,060
They haven't worked
collaboratively,

122
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:00,120
they don't communicate
aloud with other developers.

123
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,310
And when you're going into those
interviews, you're going to have

124
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,700
to communicate aloud about code.
And that can be, I know

125
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,990
for me, that was a really
hard learning curve.

126
00:06:06,995 --> 00:06:11,220
I was not good at speaking
code words out loud.

127
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,540
Dan: Speaking code
words out loud. Yeah.

128
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,519
Dan: I mean, that's a silly way
to say that.

129
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,000
But like, I think that --

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,769
Bekah: So I told you I wasn't
good at it.

131
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:18,899
Dan: I- I mean, I
totally agree with that.

132
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:22,050
I- I mean, I- I'm always a
proponent of like building things,

133
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,500
you know, as a way to learn.
And I think, yeah, I think

134
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
building something with
other people is also very

135
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,370
important ... skill to like --
start to -- it-

136
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,269
it doesn't always like --
isn't always taught, right?

137
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,259
It isn't always
taught in a classroom.

138
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:37,139
I- I know that, like, lots of
bootcamps do have collaborative

139
00:06:37,144 --> 00:06:40,439
projects. It's part of their
curriculum. But it's a

140
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,300
little different, I suppose,
when it's not a school-

141
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,170
Bekah: Yeah.

142
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,639
Dan: -project or, you
know, bootcamp, whatever --

143
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,000
a classroom situation.
But yeah, like, learning --

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
that- that's like one of the --
especially if you're hiring a

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
junior role like that, where
you're gonna be interviewing --

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,800
where you're expecting to
hire somebody ... at that

147
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,709
level. Those sorts of
skills are something they

148
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,949
can set you as -- like, far
apart from- from other

149
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:04,290
people from -- in the same
boat, right?

150
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:09,404
You know, so, they all -- like
the- the- the, like, breadth

151
00:07:09,464 --> 00:07:11,894
of technical skills at that
level will be, like, pretty

152
00:07:11,894 --> 00:07:15,435
tight. And so, ways to- ways
to, like, set yourself apart.

153
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,925
I think communication skills
is like a huge one, right?

154
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:20,204
I mean, if I- if I have -- if
I'm interviewing with somebody,

155
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:22,495
and they can- they can sort
of speak well and have

156
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:26,949
some, like ... I mean, speak
well about- about code. Like

157
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,000
you were saying, use code
words. Like, whatever. All of

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,740
that- that sort

158
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,839
of thing are- are used to, like,
talking out loud or explaining

159
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,129
some processes, or even just
explaining how a thing works

160
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:37,000
that you built, you know?

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,300
Bekah: Yeah.

162
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Dan: Even if it's a thing
that's --

161
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,000
for bootcamp. Maybe lots of
times -- well, I've never been

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,300
to do

162
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,000
bootcamp, so I- I don't know.
But like, you would turn in

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the assignment. I don't know.
Do you do like presentations,

164
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,000
after you finish?

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Bekah: We did.
So for each of our -- we

165
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,259
had like a series of
projects that we had to do.

166
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:56,189
And so, after each one, we had
to walk through the code. And

167
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:59,850
then for the last one, they
asked us questions. And we had

168
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,240
to add on a feature depending
on what the interviewer

169
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:07,845
felt would work for the
application that you created.

170
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,000
Dan: Okay.

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Bekah: So there was live coding
that was involved in that.

172
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,024
Dan: Nice. That's cool.

171
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:11,865
Bekah: Yeah.
And I feel like you

172
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:15,800
can get somebody who
is experienced in the industry

173
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,000
to do the same thing with you.
So if you have-

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,300
Dan: Sure.

175
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,000
Bekah: -a project

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,900
that you're using as a portfolio
project, then what you can do

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,764
is say like, "Hey, would you
mind walking through this with

176
00:08:24,764 --> 00:08:27,915
me? Suggest, like, what I can
do?" Do a code review with

177
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:31,665
somebody, just so you get an
understanding of like whether

178
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,000
or not your code is written
well. I think that you'll always

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,800
be able to improve on your code.
But when you're doing it

180
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,500
in isolation and you're
often just trying to see,

181
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,800
like, does this work-

182
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,000
Dan: Right.

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Bekah: -you know, there's more
that goes

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
into coding than does this work.

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,300
Dan: Yeah.

184
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:51,389
Bekah: Is it- is it written
well or efficiently?

184
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:53,309
Dan: Yeah.
Oh, I- I think that's great.

185
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:56,355
And- and I think, another path
to practice that sort of

186
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:58,044
thing is open source as well.

187
00:08:58,044 --> 00:08:58,304
Bekah: Yeah.

187
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,674
Dan: And another thing that we
talk about a lot, in Virtual

188
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:04,544
Coffee, at -- in this podcast,
is it's another great way

189
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,085
to practice those skills
and prac- you know, see

190
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:12,945
what works and- and-
and join other code bases.

191
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:16,875
And like, that's another skill
that is- is ... sometimes

192
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,460
maybe a harder one learn -- not
harder one to learn, but maybe

193
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,000
not an obvious one to learn-

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,300
Bekah: Yeah.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,600
Dan: -is like how to dig into 
... an unfamiliar code base,

195
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:24,710
right?

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Bekah: Yeah.

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,300
Dan: And there's like --
[chuckles] there's-

195
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,500
there's some things that you
can do to make it easier, but

196
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,879
in general, it's very much just
practice.

197
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,549
It will, you know, like if
you practice it, it will --

198
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:37,000
you'll get better at it. And
so, there's a million, billion

199
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
projects [chuckles] out there
on GitHub that all are looking

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,690
for help. And ... you know, I
don't know. Jump in.

201
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:44,779
Bekah: Yeah.

201
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,879
Dan: I -- we have a lot of
episodes where we've talked

202
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,575
about, like, all- all the
reasons why it's a good idea to

203
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:56,205
do it. And like, also like, the
... things to do to- to get over

204
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:58,995
some anxiety you might -- may
have about- about doing that

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
as a- as a junior developer.
Like, just jump in or,

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
[chuckles] you know, do some
peer -- pull requests on just

207
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,784
documentation or whatever,
just to get your feet wet.

208
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:10,004
Like, that kind of thing.
There's like -- a

209
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:10,514
lot of stuff like that. So --

210
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,600
Bekah: Yeah.
And I think, also, it's a

211
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,000
pretty easy ask to say like,
"Hey, I really wanna get

212
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,759
started in open source, I'm
a little nervous about this.

213
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,700
Is there anybody out
there that would be up for

214
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,730
mentoring me through it
if I'm struggling?"

215
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,149
Dan: Yeah.

215
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:26,070
Bekah: And then that way, you
know, you can pair up with

216
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:28,259
someone, you can work on those
communication skills, and then

217
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:30,779
you don't have to feel nervous
about what you're doing.

218
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:31,799
You have that support.

219
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,700
Dan: Agreed. And ... absolutely
agreed. And, like, join Virtual

220
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,000
Coffee [chuckles], you know
what I mean? It's -- there's a

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,580
lot of people

221
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,370
that are always down to help
with that sort of thing.

222
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:43,649
And it's good.

223
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:44,519
Bekah: Yeah.

224
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,500
Dan: All right.
Before we go on, I'm getting

225
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,800
really nervous that I forgot to
hit record or it didn't work.

226
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,000
So I'm just gonna go look
at-

227
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:51,000
Bekah: Yep. Go check it
[laughs].

228
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,669
Dan: -really quick.
Yeah. No, we're good.

228
00:10:56,909 --> 00:10:58,800
Bekah: We're good. We're good.
We've been recording. Per-

229
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,490
excellent.

230
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Dan: We're good. Everything
is okay.

229
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:01,350
Bekah: Cuz I was gonna make
you do the whole thing over.

230
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:02,639
Dan: Yeah, that would be
[inaudible].

231
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,639
Bekah: Okay. So, let's see.

231
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,870
Did we -- so your first role --
and- and along with landing

232
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,169
your first role, I think
always finding community,

233
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,259
finding people. And remembering
that, like, your network is

234
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,330
not just the people you
know, it's the network of the

235
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,000
people you know. So-

236
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,500
Dan: Yeah.

237
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,600
Bekah: -making connections that

236
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,000
are not transactional, and like,
"Hey, I want to know

237
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
you so I can get a job," right?
Like, get to know people and

238
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,065
be their friends, be kind, don't
criticize their deadlift form,

239
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:33,500
[Dan laughs] and then you-
you'll have a better shot at

240
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:33,945
finding a job.

240
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:37,300
Dan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Probably- probably just

241
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,800
in general, not giving an,
you know, giving advice to

242
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,600
people who didn't ask for
it, you know? Especially

243
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,065
people you don't know.

244
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:45,000
Bekah: I mean,
like, generally speaking, I

245
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,975
like it when people give me
advice. I know that that's

246
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,345
like kind of controversial,
cuz a lot of people are

247
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:53,955
like, "Don't give me advice.
I didn't ask for it."

248
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:56,054
But I- I don't know.
I like to hear what

249
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:59,384
other people have to say.
And I often ask for advice a lot.

250
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:03,434
I guess that's another bit of
advice is ask- ask for advice

251
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:06,735
because not everybody's just
gonna give it to you. Also,

252
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:09,000
sometimes advice is bad.
People get bad advice.

253
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,615
Dan: That's not true.

253
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,924
Bekah: Like, also his deadlift
stance [Dan chuckles] yesterday.

254
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:14,235
I'll get over that
in a couple of weeks.

255
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:14,000
Dan: Yeah, right?

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Bekah: I'm --

257
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Dan: I'm personally shocked

256
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
that the drunk guy at the
bar last night didn't have

257
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,855
perfect deadlift form
[chuckles].

258
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:25,965
Bekah: All right. Let's
go to the next one.

259
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:27,164
Dan: Okay. Next question.

260
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:29,924
Bekah: I don't know what
that says. And, what happened?

261
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:31,000
Oh, no.

262
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,000
Dan: I- I don't know.

263
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,735
Bekah: It might not let me
answer.

262
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:36,825
Wait a minute.
I don't wanna do that.

263
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,384
[Chuckles] How does a computer
get drunk?

264
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:46,679
Dan: Well,
do you know the answer?

265
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,610
Bekah: No.

266
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,080
Dan: Screenshots.

267
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,929
Bekah: [Chuckles] Did you
submit that question?

268
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:53,000
Dan: I- I did. I did. That
was me.

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,289
[All laugh] This is a good one,
right?

269
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:00,840
Bekah: Who was the last dude
you texted?

270
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:02,220
Dan: Jesus Christ, people.

271
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,335
Bekah: Let's see.
Probably Dan. Probably

272
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:12,225
you. You were the- the last
one I texted.

273
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,554
Dan: Yes. I don't know. I mean
... are- are you asking me?

274
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:16,725
Cuz I don't know-

275
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:17,000
Bekah: I don't know.

276
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Dan: I don't know who you
texted.

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,615
Bekah: I- I didn't --

276
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:19,875
Dan: You did text me recently.

277
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,514
Bekah: I did recently text
you. About this conference.

278
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:25,014
Who was the last dude you texted?

279
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:29,000
Dan: Mm ... I dunno. My --
one of my friends? One of

280
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,004
my friends

280
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:32,745
just took his dog out in the
canoe for the first time.

281
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,144
And so he was sharing
pictures of that. And I said,

282
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:35,945
"That's cool."

283
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:36,664
Bekah: Nice.

284
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:37,304
Dan: Yeah.

285
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:39,825
Bekah: That was excellent.
So- so there- there you have it.

286
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:41,000
We did really well.
Those anonymous

287
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,700
questions were fantastic.
Thank you all for doing such

288
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,600
a good job of sending them [all
chuckle]. We do have a handful

289
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,000
of non-anonymous questions.
Un-anonymous, unanimous

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,600
question.

290
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:55,139
Dan: Unanimous?

291
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,519
Bekah: Mm-hmm. I think that's
the right word.

292
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:59,100
Dan: Un-anonymous, I think.

293
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:05,340
Bekah: Un-anonymous.
I wrote one of 'em down.

00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,300
Dan: Oh.

294
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,970
Bekah: So I wouldn't forget.
Okay. This one comes from Meg.

295
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,029
Dan: Is this notebook from
like, 1920 or something?

296
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,340
Bekah: Listen, I keep
buying these notebooks.

297
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,500
They sell them at T.J. Maxx
in a pack of three.

298
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,559
This one says the right stuff.
I like these notebooks.

299
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:20,519
Dan: Look at the inside though.
Show them the inside.

300
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:22,544
Bekah: What's wrong
with the inside?

301
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:26,684
Dan: It looks like it's,
you know, paper from ... the

302
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:27,644
civil war or something
[laughs].

303
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:31,004
Bekah: [Chuckles] Is that what
civil war paper looked like?

304
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:32,424
Dan: I don't know. But,
probably.

305
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,475
Bekah: I think you're wrong.
And a liar.

306
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:36,884
Dan: Oh, I and ... here we go.

307
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:38,325
Bekah: All right.
This one's from Meg.

308
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:40,865
Is there anything you
would've done differently

309
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:44,355
when it comes to Virtual
Coffee's setup, organization,

310
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,565
time commitment, et cetera.
You go first.

311
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:49,800
Dan: I mean, that's a really
good question. But, like, it's

312
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
hard to have an answer for
it because everything

313
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,600
that, like, has happened has
been so organic, you know?

314
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:54,825
Bekah: Yeah.

314
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:58,000
Dan: And you- you, like, you
think about, like, all the 

315
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,379
things that

315
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:00,000
we have going on right now,
like, everything that's

316
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
in play and- and, like, yeah.
Like, I can think of a

317
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,500
lot of things that could
be better or, you know,

318
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,800
right now, or whatever.
But ... I think if we had

319
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,500
started from scratch in, like --
we're like, "Let's try to build

320
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,800
this community, but like
start..." you know, I- I don't

321
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,300
know. Who

321
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,475
knows what we would've done.
You know what I mean?

322
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:22,845
And it probably, I don't
know. It's a good chance

323
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,254
it wouldn't have worked
maybe. You know what I mean?

324
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:24,400
Like-

325
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:24,600
Bekah: Yeah.

326
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,700
Dan: Like, I'd like to think it

325
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,000
would've, but the- the --
one of the beauties of the- of

326
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
the community -- of the Virtual
Coffee community is- is the

327
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,184
sort of organic, like, nature
of how all that starting it.

328
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,000
And of course, all that was,
like, around you [chuckles].

329
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,644
But, like,

329
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:41,514
it's -- and it's, like, one of
the reasons why Virtual Coffee

330
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:42,000
is sort of different and-

331
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,300
Bekah: Yeah.

331
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,000
Dan: -successful. I've -- I
feel it. As opposed, to, like

332
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,504
... I'm trying to think

332
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:51,414
of an example, but, you know,
I suppose there's people who

333
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:53,575
are like, "I'm gonna start
a community," or something.

334
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:56,784
And sometimes they're cool,
and sometimes they're not, but

335
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,039
you never know what it's --
like, you never know what's

336
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,070
gonna happen un- until it
happens. With- with, like,

337
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,090
groups of people, you know?

338
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:03,509
Bekah: Yeah.

339
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,899
Dan: So, I don't know ... I
mean, I could think

340
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,389
of, I don't know.
I could think of like a lot

341
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:13,000
of -- like little instant, like
instances of times that like,

342
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,800
okay, I wish I made a
di-different decision there,

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,700
you know, but

343
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,800
that's- that's less like ...
that's more just like I make 

00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,000
mistakes,

344
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
not- not so much like, you
know, tactical, like, planning

345
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,149
stuff, you know what I mean?

346
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,480
Bekah: Yeah.

347
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,750
Dan: I dunno. What about you?

348
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,690
Bekah: Well, I think it's nice
because- because of like the

349
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,889
authenticity and the organic
evolution of Virtual Coffee,

350
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:38,120
that we have more freedom
to make mistakes almost, right?

351
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,179
Dan: Yeah.

352
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,000
Bekah: Because we know that
the people who are coming

353
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,519
to Virtual Coffee are okay
with that. Because they know

354
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,470
that we're human beings, and
we, like, we do get things

355
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,980
wrong sometimes. I, for sure,
have gotten things wrong on a

356
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,044
number of things at Virtual
Coffee. And, you know, you-

357
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:54,870
you try and get 'em right.
The next time, you learn

358
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,110
your lesson, you apologize
when you need to.

359
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:04,480
And I- I think a lot about
what I would do differently,

360
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,250
but I actually think it's
kind of a strength that we

361
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,279
had no idea what we were
doing in the beginning.

362
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,519
Dan: Yeah.

363
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:14,730
Bekah: Because, you know,
now that I'm community building

364
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,079
professionally, I'm, like,
diving into things like

365
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:24,000
metrics, and planning.
And a lot of different, like,

366
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,960
processes and procedures that I
wouldn't have considered before.

367
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:31,680
And I think that sometimes it
actually makes me less creative

368
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,470
with what the community will
look like, because I see

369
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,740
what everybody else is doing.
And it feels like these are

370
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,000
the things that you should
be doing if you're building

371
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,460
a community, because this
is what the experts say.

372
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,180
And I'm like -- sometimes
I get caught in it, like

373
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,369
thinking about Virtual Coffee.
And I'm like, "No," you know,

374
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:52,920
"This is -- that's not true
to who we are as a community."

375
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,009
Dan: Right.

376
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,519
Bekah: But I'm, like,
trying to think too [silence]

377
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:05,500
what I would do differently.
I- I think I would find more

378
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,700
ways early on to allow people
to support the efforts of

379
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,700
Virtual Coffee, to provide
more autonomy for members

380
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,000
to do their own things.
Like, I'm really enjoying

381
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,954
seeing the coffee table groups
grow, and the different

382
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:22,500
things that we're doing.
Ray is doing the Virtual

383
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,700
Coffee speech club now.
And, like, I love that. That's

384
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,800
one of my favorite things.
But, like, finding more ways

385
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,000
to empower people to do that.
Like, honestly, I wish that

386
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I had more time in the day
because I think that we have

387
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,700
so many great people at Virtual
Coffee that are willing to

388
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,000
provide support for-

389
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,000
Dan: Yeah.

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,700
Bekah: -a lot of different

389
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,700
things and finding ...
more ways to empower them to do

390
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,335
that is one of those things that
I still wish that I could do

391
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:55,755
better.

392
00:18:55,904 --> 00:19:00,434
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's
... that's a hard problem.

393
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,144
And, you know, I- I know of --
both from my experience and

394
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,994
from, like, talking to other
people, it's very hard to find

395
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:10,755
people that are willing to,
like, put time and effort into

396
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,585
something like a volunteer
thing like that, you know?

397
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:16,000
And I think that just
goes ... to show how awesome

398
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,500
Virtual Coffee is. That we
have all these people that are

399
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,000
doing this stuff, you know?
And the- the to- coffee table

400
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
groups, all -- almost all of
them started before we, like --

401
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,300
just on their own, you know?
Right?

402
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:25,599
Bekah: Yeah.

402
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,300
Dan: Like, before we had
anything around them.

403
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,910
Like, we are

403
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,424
building stuff to support them
now because they exist already,

404
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:35,055
you know? As opposed to, like,
we had some idea for coffee

405
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:37,194
table groups, and then we're
trying to find people to- to

406
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,815
do them or something like that,
right? And that's, you know, it

407
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:42,944
just goes back to the,
you know, the organic

408
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:48,700
nature of- of Virtual Coffee.
And ... if we were planning

409
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,000
this -- I mean, you could
see like special interest

410
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,800
groups being a thing to plan
[chuckles], you know, if

411
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,795
you're trying to plan a group
ahead of time, or a community.

412
00:19:57,914 --> 00:20:01,000
But, I don't know.
It's- it's hard to imagine,

413
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
like, trying to do all this
stuff a-ahead of time, or

414
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,045
whatever, you know what I mean?

415
00:20:06,134 --> 00:20:06,434
Bekah: Yeah.

416
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,420
Dan: Also, that's not
usually how my brain works

417
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,300
that well anyway. I- I mean 
[chuckles] the- the way that

418
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,539
things have

418
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,869
gone is what, you know, is
obviously, like, it's more how

419
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:18,000
my brain works anyway, you
know? Kind of like-

420
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,300
Bekah: Same.

421
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:18,509
Dan: -along with

420
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,670
things and trying to make things
better, but, I don't know.

421
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,970
It's ... well, it is what it
is. I don't know.

422
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,800
Bekah: Yeah. I mean, I ...
I'm, like, super proud of

423
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
us for early on getting
a lot of documentation in

424
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,000
place because that-

425
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,300
Dan: Yes.

426
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,809
Bekah: -has helped to provide
a better space for people.

427
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,300
Dan: Yeah.

425
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:40,000
Bekah: I- I would
like- I would like to do

426
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,900
a better job of onboarding
new community members.

427
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,200
Dan: Yep.

427
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,769
Bekah: And I feel like that-
that from the beginning. So I

428
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:49,380
feel like a lot of the, like,
would you do differently is --

429
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,670
are still things that, like, I
would like to do more of, now?

430
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,750
Dan: Yeah, sure. Yeah.

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Bekah: Especially now that
we have

431
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,600
new members coming in. It's
so great to see new faces

432
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,180
at Virtual Coffee again.

433
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:01,240
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

434
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,259
Bekah: That's been a- a
really bright side of

435
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:06,800
the last couple of weeks.
But I just wanna make sure

436
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,700
that everybody's taken care of.

437
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,700
Dan: Yep. Yeah, I agree.
And that's like, you know, so

438
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,329
there's, like, technology stuff
that I- I just wanna change now.

439
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:18,210
It's- it's not even- it's not
even like, "Oh, I wish we

440
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,390
had done this differently." It's
just ... well, now we need it.

441
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,190
Like, now we need things.
Like, there's things

442
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,500
we need, you know? So
let's change them. The- the

443
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
new member thing, especially.
It's especially cuz it's built,

444
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,000
like, originally around Slack [chuckles], you know?

445
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,300
Bekah: Yeah.

446
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,220
Dan: And that's ... that
sounds --

445
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,750
Bekah: That, maybe, is
something I would change.

446
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:36,000
Dan: I don't know. Yeah. I
mean, like, maybe. But, like,

447
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,500
it was really before Discord,
like, took off- like, took off

448
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,700
for people outside of gaming,
you know?

00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500 
Dan: And ... I don't know.

449
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,700
That -- there's any better
option and it, like, created the

450
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,039
community, honestly. Like, it
-- like, you know what I mean?

451
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,069
It's -- I mean, the, Zooms and
the- and the Slack, it's like,

452
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:56,000
it's what was -- it was the
whole thing for first ...

453
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
however long. I don't know.
I dunno. Whatever. However

454
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
many months or whatever it
was, you know? So- so yeah.

455
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,769
Yeah. There's things that, like,
I'd like to see improved and

456
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:12,920
stuff. But it's -- I don't look
at them as- as, you know,

457
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,970
regrets or whatever, if that
makes sense.

458
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:20,800
Bekah: Yeah. Let me ... okay.
So the next question is, what's

459
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,434
the hardest part ...
of community?

460
00:22:26,714 --> 00:22:29,295
Dan: Of, like, run- running a
community?

461
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:33,345
Bekah: Just of community.
So you can take it as you- as

462
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:35,039
you ... see fit.

463
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,029
Dan: I don't know, man.
I -- like, alright.

464
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:43,700
So, for me, part of -- as a
member of communities is- is

00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,430
just like ...

465
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,800
it- it takes, like, emotional
energy for me to engage with

466
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,099
things, engage with people,
and do things or whatever.

467
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,190
And so sometimes I find
myself like just falling

468
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,944
out of communities or- or
just like not -- whatever.

469
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:01,595
And it- it even happens in
Virtual Coffee sometimes.

470
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,600
I mean, you and I ... I mean,
we talk all the

471
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,000
time, like, doing management
side. But, like, I- I'll

472
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,800
miss, like, coffees for weeks
because it's like ... 8.50

473
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,700
in the morning, you know?
And- and it's not -- I'm

474
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,500
not tired or anything.
It's just like, I need- I

475
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,700
needed a certain amount of -- a
store of energy to be able to

476
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,869
like, talk to people, you know?
Especially people I don't know.

477
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,630
And I love it. But,
like, sometimes it's-

478
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,000
sometimes it's hard. And so ...
I -- although that will say --

479
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,545
I will say, like, every time
that I've felt that

480
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:35,144
way, but then still gone,
I've been very glad that I went-

481
00:23:35,144 --> 00:23:35,204
Bekah: Yeah.

00:23:35,204 --> 00:23:37,625
Dan: -you know what I mean?
Like, it's- it's one of

482
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,300
those, like, "Catch-22" where
my brain is, like, fooling

483
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,224
me about it, you know?

484
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,285
Bekah: Yeah.

485
00:23:39,944 --> 00:23:41,714
Dan: But, like, overcoming that,
that's -- that can be hard.

486
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:45,545
And then another thing
for me is, my memory's

487
00:23:45,545 --> 00:23:47,674
really bad, especially
with like names and stuff,

488
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:51,305
and, like -- a-and so, you know,
remembering people that I met

489
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:53,500
or like that I'm supposed to
know or let- you know,

490
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,214
I'll- I'll --

490
00:23:54,214 --> 00:23:57,214
I sensibly do know, but have
forgotten who they are or what

491
00:23:57,214 --> 00:23:59,555
their name is or, you know,
that happens to me, like, a lot.

492
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:02,000
And it's much easier
online because you can kinda

493
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
like, look -- try to Google
them or something [chuckles],

494
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,414
you know?

494
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:04,565
Bekah: Yeah.

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,700
Dan: Harder in person.
Like, it's more- more

495
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,700
embarrassing for me in person.
So it's -- that's my other-

796
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,484
Bekah: Yeah.

496
00:24:10,174 --> 00:24:11,200
Dan: -struggle. What about you?

497
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,700
Bekah: Well ... I guess the-
the thing that I never

498
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,805
would've thought

498
00:24:17,805 --> 00:24:22,875
about, before this community,
was last year, when Mike passed

499
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,505
away. That was, like, obviously
a really hard experience.

500
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:30,765
He was an active
community member.

501
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:34,600
Like, everybody loved him.
But then, like,

502
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,000
making decisions-

503
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,300
Dan: Yeah.

504
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,000
Bekah: -about that-

505
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,484
Dan: Yep.

503
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:41,500
Bekah: -and having to tell
people over and over was --

504
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,434
Dan: Yeah?

504
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:45,900
Bekah: I- I -- like, something
that you can't ever be

505
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,724
prepared for.

505
00:24:46,724 --> 00:24:52,335
And so, like, experiencing the
losses of community members

506
00:24:53,204 --> 00:24:56,800
and with community members.
And, like, trying to leave

507
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,000
space for people to experience
grief in different ways-

508
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,234
Dan: Yeah.

508
00:25:01,244 --> 00:25:05,000
Bekah: -is just ... I- I don't
know. I felt like, I was

509
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,914
stretched beyond my limits of
human being. Like, I-

510
00:25:10,914 --> 00:25:11,115
Dan: Yeah.

510
00:25:11,115 --> 00:25:14,000
Bekah: -went through -- and-
and, you know, it was hard

511
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,164
with Mike, but like

511
00:25:15,164 --> 00:25:17,325
there have been other losses
in the communities, right?

512
00:25:17,325 --> 00:25:20,325
Like, there have been
miscarriages, there

513
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:23,625
have been jobs lost,
there have been relationships

514
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:27,800
that are no longer.
And when people, like, confide

515
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:34,000
in you, and talk to you about
that, it's just ... one of

516
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,305
those --

516
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:36,700
it is definitely the hardest-

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,500
Dan: Yeah.

00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,799
Bekah: -emotional labor that-
that

517
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,000
I have ever had to put in
anywhere. It- [chuckles]

518
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,500
it's like a "Catch-22" though,
right? Like-

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,579
Bekah: -you have to ...
experience ...

519
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:58,470
like, the- the full humanness
to really be close and

520
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:59,500
supportive to the-

00:26:59,300 --> 00:26:59,500
Dan: Yeah.

00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,140
Bekah: -the people around you.

521
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:06,029
So like, would I love to
not ever have to experience

522
00:26:06,035 --> 00:26:07,000
any of those things?

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,200
Dan: Sure.

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,300
Bekah: Yeah. But I think it's
the -- a key part

523
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,000
of understanding the
people in front of us

524
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,400
to be there through it. So --

525
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,720
Dan: Yeah. No, I- I- I mean, I 
totally agree. And that's like,

526
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,700
it was- it was incredibly hard.
A- and ... but I just -- I was,

527
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,500
like, while you were talking
just now, I was just, like,

528
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,700
thinking of how ... thankful
I am that, like, Virtual

529
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,000
Coffee is- is what it is.
And, like, it's a place where

530
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,500
people can come to, like, share
... this- this horrible thing --

531
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,000
like, the heavy feelings or-

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,200
Bekah: Yeah.

00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,700
Dan: -you know, it's -- it
obviously is

532
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,500
hard. But I think, like, my --
I guess my point is just

533
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:53,300
like ... that it's worth it.
Like [laughs]-

00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,500
Bekah: Yeah.

00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,569
Dan: -I guess it- it's my
point.

534
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:55,000
You know what I mean?

00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,300
Bekah: Yeah.

00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,000
Dan: Like, the -- like, it is
like,

535
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
it- it- it's ... yeah. It's
that. It's- it's just -- it's

536
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
hard, but like, it's also like
-- it's what makes Virtual

537
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Coffee, like, what it is, you
know? I mean, the -- that's-

538
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
that's sort of, like,
connection. The, you know, the-

539
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
the intimate connection, right?
Is- is -- I started noticing it

540
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
even before ... maybe right
around, like, our- our,

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
like, original

541
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Hacktoberfest time, you know?
Like, when we all started like

542
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
really doing that, but like,
just the -- I this is gonna,

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,300
like, sound --

543
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,000
it might sound like silly. But,
like, the fact that like, people

544
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,039
would just, like, throw around
the heart emoji, you know?

545
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:34,240
And like ... just to people, you
know? Like, not- not your best

546
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,369
friends or not -- but just like
people, like, in the community,

547
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:38,440
you know, made me feel good.
I don't- I don't know why.

548
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:44,019
Like -- and- and- and to be able
to also -- like, also start

549
00:27:44,025 --> 00:27:45,789
throwing around the heart
emoji, or whatever, you

550
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,710
know? Like, I -- it's like a --
it's like kind of a silly

551
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,500
way to say it. But, like, to-
to both share ... you

552
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,009
know, I guess sharing it, right?
Like, both -- like, two ways,

553
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:54,700
right? You know what I mean?

00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,000
Bekah: Yeah.

00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,259
Dan: There's like --
there's- there's good

554
00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:00,500
feelings coming ... both ways,
and I -- from everybody

555
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,089
in the community. And, like,
I dunno. This -- it's good.

556
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,900
Bekah: Yeah. I think when you
can eg- share

557
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,269
your losses openly like that,
then you celebrate your wins.

558
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:12,359
Dan: Right.

559
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,269
Bekah: You know, just as
strongly in the other direction.

560
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,289
So it- it is definitely one of
the hardest, but one of the

561
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,130
most rewarding to be able to
know that there are people

562
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,009
out there that trust you to
share that information, that

563
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,990
you know, that if you're
going to be going through

564
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,259
something hard, that there
are gonna be people there too.

565
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,174
And I know that my empathy and
understanding of other people

566
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:38,204
has definitely, I feel like-
like "The Grinch", right?

567
00:28:38,204 --> 00:28:39,000
Like [chuckles]-

00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,000
Dan: Yeah [laughs].

00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:42,000
Bekah: I was a little bit of
"The Grinch"

568
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,335
before Virtual Coffee [laughs].

569
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:45,500
Dan: [Inaudible] Two- two --
three- three sizes. It's --

00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,000
Bekah: Yeah.

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,900
Dan: No, that's a great call.

570
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,500
And that's a good point.
Like, I mean, I have learned

571
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,600
so much just about like ...
yeah. Expressing myself and

00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,000
talking to --

572
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
connecting with people and ...
yeah. My ... I was gonna say,

573
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
like, my- my, like, emotional
literacy, I feel like has

574
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:05,000
exploded over the last few
years. It- it reminds me of s-

575
00:29:07,500--> 00:29:09,000
... I forget what we were
talking about, but I was

576
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
talking with somebody and I
was- I was like -- they were

577
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
like -- this was earlier in
pandemic when things were

578
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,095
like, still like a lot
more shut down, you know?

579
00:29:18,095 --> 00:29:20,464
And they were talking about
how they hadn't, like, they

580
00:29:20,464 --> 00:29:22,115
hadn't, like, meeting new people
or they haven't talked, you

581
00:29:22,115 --> 00:29:23,000
know, like all this stuff.
And I'm like, I've actually,

582
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
like, made more friends.

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,200
Bekah: Yeah.

00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,000
Dan: I mean, it is because of
Virtual

583
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Coffee -- or once Virtual
Coffee started, but like, made

584
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:32,000
more friends, new friends in
that time, in the last three

585
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,700
years than I had in the last
10 years before that [chuckles]

586
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,000
I think,

586
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
you know? Like, put together.
And like- and like good

587
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,500
friends. Not-

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,200
Bekah: Yeah.

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Dan: -you know,
not just like random Twitter

588
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,210
followers or something,
you know- you know what I mean?

589
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:46,529
Like ... and- and, yeah. I
mean, that's all- that's all

590
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:49,470
Virtual Coffee, you know? It's-
it's just like, you know, it's

591
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:49,650
good stuff.

592
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:52,900
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. And
it's great. Like, we get to

593
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
meet up some of us.

594
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,765
Dan: I know.
Well, this is [inaudible] --

594
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:56,234
Bekah: Which is really, really
nice.

595
00:29:56,234 --> 00:29:57,500
Dan: Yeah.
This is the second time that

596
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,875
Bekah and I have met in person.
Cuz -- and when- when did we

597
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,434
meet? When did- when did we,
like, start working together?

00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,500
Is 2019 [??] ... June [??] --

598
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Bekah: July of two thousand --

00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,300
Dan: 18?

00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,600
Bekah: 18.

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,500
Dan: 18?

00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,000
Bekah: I think.

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,500
Dan: Okay. Yeah. So --

599
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,000
Bekah: Yeah.

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Dan: Two times every ... four
-- what year is it now?

600
00:30:16,964 --> 00:30:17,200
Bekah: 22.

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,500
Dan: 22? So it ... two times
every three years s-see each

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:21,800
other in person?

601
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,000
Bekah: Yeah.

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,500
Dan: Right?

00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,289
Bekah: Yeah. And we're
in Kansas City. So --

602
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,019
Dan: We're in Kansas
city right now. Make sense.

603
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:27,000
Bekah: We live like two hours
from each other, like [laughs]

604
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:28,500
... but --

00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,150
Dan: This is the only place
that would take us really. So --

605
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:30,800
Bekah: Yeah.

00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,200
Dan: Yeah.

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,849
Bekah: I guess that's
understandable.

606
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,700
All right.
Let's see what other questions.

607
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,500
Dan: [Inaudible] time over
ahead [??].

00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,000
Bekah: We still got-

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,500
Dan: Oh, we got-

00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,710
Bekah: -some time.

608
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,609
Dan: -twenty minutes-ish
before hours up. I dunno.

609
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:48,000
Bekah: Um ... oh, okay.

610
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Dan: I suppose we should have

610
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,410
said something on Slack about
how we are going live.

611
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:52,059
Bekah: I did.

612
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:52,769
Dan: Oh, good job.

613
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:53,279
Bekah: Don't worry.

614
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:54,359
Dan: Did you do
it on Twitter too?

615
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,359
Bekah: I didn't
on Twitter though. Sorry.

616
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:05,369
Can't cover all the spaces.
Uh-oh. What did you do? Did it

617
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:05,644
pause it?

618
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,900
Dan: I don't- I don't know if
it did for that

619
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,759
moment, but it is going again.
So ... we're in good shape.

620
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,119
The recording [inaudible]
several technical issues.

621
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:16,559
We've been recording for
like half an hour.

622
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,000
Bekah:  You need to sit -- be

623
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,529
in -- closer to your mic.
Cuz I can't hear you.

624
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:22,845
Dan: Has it -- that been true
the full time? Or just now,

00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:23,500
since I got up?

625
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,855
Bekah: It was like, just
since you got up.

00:31:24,855 --> 00:31:25,000
Dan: Okay, good.

00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Bekah: All right.
Where are the questions?

627
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,555
Dan: I don't know.

628
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:29,384
Bekah: There was another one.
And --

629
00:31:29,384 --> 00:31:30,000
Dan: Oh, Ayu
had a question that was --

630
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,664
I know it was a trap.

631
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:33,555
Bekah: It was a trap?

632
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:33,855
Dan: Yeah. For me.

633
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:37,065
Bekah: It was a trap for you?
Okay, wait. Let me --

634
00:31:39,345 --> 00:31:41,384
Dan: I think it was on Twitter.

635
00:31:41,384 --> 00:31:44,000
Bekah: Twitter. Thanks,
Barrett Blake, for saying

636
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,234
the Virtual Coffee
podcast is a must listen.

637
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:49,170
Dan: Yes. Thank you.

638
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,000
Bekah: We love it.

639
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,079
Dan: [Chuckles] We love it.

640
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,329
Bekah: Um ... why can't I find
it? Okay.

641
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:59,890
Maybe it's the history of how
Virtual Coffee was found.

642
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,900
Oh yes.

643
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,619
Dan: Yes. See?

644
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:03,240
Bekah: Go ahead.

645
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:04,890
Dan: What? I didn't found it.

646
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:10,829
Bekah: Well, you fired me,
and --

647
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,601
Dan: See? Ayu is just -- [Bekah
laughs] this is, like --

648
00:32:13,605 --> 00:32:16,000
this is it. Every- every time.
Starts like that. I didn't

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,800
fire you. Yeah.

649
00:32:20,234 --> 00:32:21,194
You heard it here, folks
[chuckles].

650
00:32:22,424 --> 00:32:27,404
Bekah: Dan said, "I will no
longer pay you to do work."

651
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:27,704
Dan: Yes.

651
00:32:27,704 --> 00:32:32,015
Bekah: So you all are welcome
to define that as you see

652
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:37,454
fit. We should have them
vote for their favorite Virtual

653
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:39,194
Coffee host and see who wins.

654
00:32:40,484 --> 00:32:41,934
Dan: That doesn't sound very fun
for me [chuckles].

655
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:44,970
Bekah: [Laughs] I mean, you mi-
you're probably a lot

656
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:45,839
of people's favorites.

657
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:48,000
Dan: Hmm ... I doubt it.
It'll probably be like,

658
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,660
just one of our guests would
win [chuckles].

659
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,000
Bekah: One of our gue- Kirk.

660
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Dan: Yeah. It's gonna be Kirk!

661
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Bekah: Kirk is gonna be the
one that win.

660
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,410
Dan: It would be -- he would
get my vote, honestly.

661
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:57,240
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah.
I vote for Kirk too.

662
00:32:57,329 --> 00:32:58,410
Everybody vote for Kirk.

663
00:32:58,414 --> 00:33:01,799
Dan: All right. It is decided.
[Chuckles] K-kirk is favorite.

664
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,230
Oh, I mean, sh-should we,
like, finish the story if

665
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,250
people haven't heard this?

666
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,000
Bekah: [Laughs] I guess so.
Okay. So, Dan and I

667
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,440
work together.

667
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,880
Dan: Yes. And then the shutdown
happened and all of my clients

668
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,700
stopped giving me work.
And so I had to stop

669
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:22,319
giving Bekah work. And then
something happened. I dunno.

670
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,900
Bekah: Yeah.
Well the- the day that I

671
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,000
went and picked up my kids'
schoolwork, cuz they said,

672
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
"Oh, you're going home --
they're going home

673
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,500
for three weeks," which they
never went back that year.

674
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:30,720
Dan: Yeah.

674
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,000
Bekah: Dan was like, "Hey,
wanna catch up?"

675
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,359
[Laughs] And I was like,
"Oh, no."

675
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:41,000
And it was, "Oh, no."
So I -- when Dan hired me right

676
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,375
outta bootcamp, I hadn't had --
we didn't do an interview.

677
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,000
Like, we just have a
conversation.

678
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,075
Dan: Yeah.

678
00:33:48,285 --> 00:33:52,125
Bekah: And so, I was now
interviewing for the first time,

679
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:55,305
really ever, with four kids at
home that were trying to

680
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:58,545
be doing school at home.
And it was just miserable.

681
00:33:58,575 --> 00:34:01,575
Like, the interview
process is soul crushing.

682
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:03,000
And I just found myself --
I was like crying all

683
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,065
the time, every night.
I'm like, "This is awful."

684
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:12,480
And so, I finally like,
remembered ... like, everything

685
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,190
I had gone through in trauma.
And I was like, "I

686
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,760
know you shouldn't be alone
and isolated in your feelings.

687
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,530
Does anybody wanna meet
up for a virtual coffee?"

688
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,000
And then people did.
So I was doing it, like, one

689
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,125
day a week. And then, it
was at East Coast time.

690
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:30,465
And then people were like,
"What about West Coast time?"

691
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:32,474
So then I added -- I was like
doing double sessions at

692
00:34:32,474 --> 00:34:35,000
one point. Like, Fridays,
I was doing in the morning,

693
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
taking a break for an
hour or two, and then

694
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
doing in the afternoon.
And it was- it was not,

695
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,425
like, I'm an introvert.
I- I- I say I'm an introvert.

696
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,905
But I -- like, by that, I was
like, I don't -- I enjoyed

697
00:34:46,905 --> 00:34:49,664
it, but I didn't, like, wanna
people anymore for like

698
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:51,500
the rest of the weekend.
That was just-

00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:51,800
Dan: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,700
Bekah: -too intense. But

699
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,700
then, we just kept going. And,
like, people were like, "Hey,

700
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,000
why don't you have a Slack?" And
so, I think Brian, initially, is

701
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
-- he was like, "Here's a
Slack." I'm like [chuckles],

702
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
"Okay." [Dan chuckles] And then
he was like,

702
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
"Let's do lunch and learns."
Okay. Then we did a newsletter,

703
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,199
and then I've always
wanted a podcast.

704
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,599
And Cameron, I think,
was like, "When are we

705
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,000
gonna do the podcast?"
And you were like,

706
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,300
"Let's do a podcast."
So we just-

00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,000 
Dan: Yeah.

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,590
Bekah: -kept going with it.

707
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:20,000
Dan: Yep.

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,340
Bekah: And Dan- Dan did
hire me back for a while.

708
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:23,699
Dan: Yeah.

709
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:24,690
Bekah: So --

710
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,000
Dan: As soon as I was able to,
I [inaudible]

711
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,500
Bekah: [Giggles] He only fired
me for a little bit.

712
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:29,949
Dan: Oh my god.

711
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:32,190
I didn't fire you. That's
not the right word.

712
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,769
You're using the
word incorrectly. I feel like,

713
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:35,710
Bekah: Oh. What
is the definition?

714
00:35:36,914 --> 00:35:38,925
Dan: I feel like, if you're
gonna fire somebody, it has to

715
00:35:38,925 --> 00:35:45,074
be for, like, a reason. Like ...
it's -- laid off is maybe what

716
00:35:45,074 --> 00:35:46,000
-- other -- like, probably
doesn't really apply to

717
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,864
contractors, but like,

717
00:35:48,644 --> 00:35:51,000
that's closer to what it is,
right? Laid off means the company

718
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,625
has to stop, you know,
can't pay you anymore.

719
00:35:53,894 --> 00:35:55,875
Bekah: However you wanna justify
it in your head, Dan.

720
00:35:55,994 --> 00:36:02,000
Dan: Oh, god. Whatever. [Bekah
chuckles] You better watch or

721
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,385
you're gonna get fired
again, cuz --

722
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,800
Bekah: You can't fire me
[chuckles]. I don't work for

723
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,070
you anymore.

723
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,219
Dan: I definitely can, and
I will.

724
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,070
Bekah: You can't fire
me if I don't work for you.

725
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,380
Dan: You can't tell me --
don't tell me my truth, okay.

726
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,500
Bekah: [All laugh] All right.
You go ahead, and you try and

727
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,000
fire me, and see how that goes.
Are you- are you firing me

728
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,489
as part of the pod- as your
podcast co-host?

729
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:32,324
Dan: No. I don't think a
lot of people tune into

730
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:35,925
the "Just Dan" podcast.
Dan talks to himself podcast.

731
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:38,684
Bekah: I would tune into
Dan talks to himself podcast.

732
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:41,114
Dan: Yeah, but you
just heckle me. So --

733
00:36:41,804 --> 00:36:43,600
Bekah: Yeah. I would
probably heckle you.

735
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,025
Dan: Yeah.

734
00:36:44,655 --> 00:36:46,485
Bekah: Well, tomorrow, when I
speak at PubConf, you're

735
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:47,385
allowed to heckle me though.

736
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:48,135
Dan: Yes.

737
00:36:48,614 --> 00:36:49,695
Bekah: Please ... heckle ...
me.

738
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:53,000
Dan: I ... yes, I will.

739
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,500
Bekah: All right.

740
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,554
Dan: I -- are you glad or sad

739
00:36:56,364 --> 00:37:02,474
that I didn't say -- yell
"Wuddup, Bek" at the

740
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:03,914
beginning of your talk
this morning? I- I thought

741
00:37:03,914 --> 00:37:04,184
about it.

742
00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:10,000
Bekah: [Laughs] I- I- I think
I'm glad that you did not

743
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,724
do that.

743
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,565
Dan: Okay. All right.
I made the right choice.

744
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,500
Bekah: I was already
super nervous.

00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:12,800
Dan: Well, that's why --

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,695
Bekah: And then I --

745
00:37:13,784 --> 00:37:14,300
Dan: That's- that's why I
didn't do it, you know?

00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,045
I didn't wanna --

746
00:37:15,045 --> 00:37:18,360
Bekah: Would've been very --
I'm not really sure how -- what

747
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:18,989
would have happened.

748
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:19,600
Dan: Yeah. I- I just, like, well,
I mean, I

749
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,000
figured you would just break
into a laughing thing where you

750
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
couldn't stop laughing and which
would've been entertaining for

751
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,630
me, but probably not for you.

752
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:28,150
Bekah: No.

753
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:29,000
Dan: I -- that's the way I made
the right choice.

754
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,889
Bekah: And then I would've
just hid in a hole.

755
00:37:31,894 --> 00:37:32,550
Dan: I just wanted you to
know, I --

756
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,000
Bekah: I would've just like
stood behind-

00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Dan: I ... considered it.

757
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,369
Bekah: -the screen and then --

757
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:37,949
Dan: I considered it and
then chose not to, you know?

758
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:38,489
Bekah: Thank you.

759
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:39,030
Dan: Yeah.

760
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:40,889
Bekah: And thanks for being
there.

761
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:43,949
Dan: Yeah. I feel like 10 years
ago, me would've done it.

762
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:45,960
And then -- I mean, and then
realized it was a bad idea,

763
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,500
after, you know? But like-
like ... wouldn't have put

764
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,469
it together beforehand,
you know? That that was a bad

765
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:52,679
idea?

766
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:54,900
Bekah: I feel like the --
my brothers definitely

767
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,000
would have done that [chuckles].

00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,469
Dan: That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.

768
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,789
Bekah: All right. We have
more questions.

769
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:00,489
Dan: I'm learning. We do?

770
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,730
Bekah: What does community
mean to you [laughs]?

771
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,494
Dan: Community? I don't know.

772
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,735
Bekah: I think community
is a group- a group of

773
00:38:12,735 --> 00:38:15,554
people that have some
shared sense of belonging.

774
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:17,985
And there can be different
degrees of that, right?

775
00:38:17,985 --> 00:38:21,195
Like, you- you all might, like,
to go hiking. And that can be a

776
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:25,335
sense of community. Or it can be
people that are ... you know, I

777
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:30,510
love true crime podcasts.
So -- and actually my favorite

778
00:38:27,284 --> 00:38:32,309
podcasters, true crime
podcasters, live in Kansas city.

779
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:32,600
Dan: Whoa.

780
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,460
Bekah: So I like the thought
about trying to get them to

780
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,650
come, like, "Can you come be
part of our live podcast?" But

781
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,110
I wasn't sure how we were gonna
talk about murder and Virtual

782
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:43,000
Coffee at the same time.
Although I have some --

783
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,840
no. I'm not gonna take
you down that tangent.

784
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,050
Dan: Oh, no.

00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,800
Bekah: Sorry [chuckles].
So, yeah. So, some sense

785
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,820
of belonging. And then there's
different degrees and ... ways

786
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,000
of ... expressing that sense
of belonging.

787
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,724
Dan: Yeah. I think that's
great. Yeah.

788
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:01,304
And the other word that I would
use is connection, right?

789
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:01,700
It is, like-

789
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,000
Bekah: Yeah.

790
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,985
Dan: -belonging and connection.

790
00:39:02,985 --> 00:39:05,925
And maybe those -- maybe
you can't feel belonging

791
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:09,690
without connection. I don't know
[chuckles]. But like, you

792
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:14,280
know, the- the -- that's the
other side of it is- is the --

793
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:14,940
is connecting with people,
right? Like, okay.

794
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:21,300
So, like, I'm a Guardians
fan, you know? And ... I

795
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,769
don't know. We were talking
about this last night,

796
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:24,150
which- which is why it's
in my head. But like, you

797
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,860
know, your regional sports
team, lots of times, you're

798
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,000
a fan of or whatever. And it --
the -- you, like, some- some

799
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
sense of belonging from that,
right? It's like-

800
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,300
Bekah: Yeah.

800
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,489
Dan: -a ... whatever. You have
the hat or whatever, you know?

801
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:34,000
Bekah: Yeah. And
when I was in the airport,

802
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,239
there was somebody wearing WVU
tennis shoes in front of me.

803
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:41,860
And, like, I graduated from WVU.
I taught there and it

804
00:39:39,014 --> 00:39:43,000
was like, "Oh," like, "That
guy's my friend."

805
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,440
[Chuckles] I don't know that
guy.

806
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:48,159
Dan: Right. Right. Right. And
you might connect, like, yeah.

807
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:49,719
And that like creates
a connect- you know?

808
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,329
And it creates a connection.
I mean, you were the

809
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:52,960
only one. Cuz you didn't
probably say --

810
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,500
Bekah: Yeah. No. I would thought
about saying, "Let's go,

811
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,980
Mountaineers," but then I got a
little embarrassed. So I didn't.

812
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,119
Dan: That's probably the right
call. So [laughs] --

00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,449
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah.

813
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,675
Dan: My mom does stuff like
that, you know? I would like --

814
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:06,735
the -- like, with- with the
Ohio state people, you know?

815
00:40:06,914 --> 00:40:07,364
Bekah: Yeah!

816
00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:09,195
Dan: It's not -- it's never fun
for me anyway [Bekah laughs].

817
00:40:10,815 --> 00:40:14,414
[Chuckles] But ... yeah, I mean
that- that's it. Like, right.

818
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,000
The belonging is a great --
like, I think that's a great,

819
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,485
I think

819
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:19,545
that's like the- the- the real
key, you know? And then, yeah.

820
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,824
And then that sense of
connection is a-also of --

821
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:25,005
Bekah: I was getting off
the escalator here, earlier.

822
00:40:25,065 --> 00:40:27,945
And some guy was waving, and I
thought he was waving at me.

823
00:40:27,974 --> 00:40:30,500
And then I, like, waved back
wholehartedly at him [laughs],

823
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,800
he was, like, was actually
waving at the guy behind me.

824
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,000
Dan: Yeah.

00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Bekah: Then I didn't feel like
I belonged.

825
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,695
I felt very embarrassed
for myself [laughs].

827
00:40:38,204 --> 00:40:40,784
Dan: You- you were not in his
community of- of waving people.

828
00:40:40,994 --> 00:40:43,184
Bekah: I- I was not- not part
of that.

829
00:40:43,635 --> 00:40:46,664
Dan: I -- it happens to me like
once a year [Bekah laughs] I'd

830
00:40:44,324 --> 00:40:47,500
say. It's really bad, you
know? Like, just like that?

00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,000
Yeah.

00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,755
Bekah: Yeah.

831
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:53,295
Dan: There's a lot of people
here. So, it's- it's easy to --

832
00:40:53,295 --> 00:40:57,855
Bekah: Yeah. I hope he forgets
my face. Let's see here. Okay.

833
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:58,000
Here's another question.

834
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,264
Dan: [Chuckles] I hope he
forgets my face.

834
00:41:00,284 --> 00:41:03,675
Bekah: At in-person events,
what are some techniques or

835
00:41:03,675 --> 00:41:07,635
tactics you use for starting
a conversation with a stranger?

836
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:11,235
I- I am, like, terrified of
talking with strangers. And I'm

837
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,704
on booth duty while I'm here,
for work at DeepGram.

838
00:41:14,804 --> 00:41:14,864
Dan: Yeah.

839
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:16,875
Bekah: And I guess it
almost makes it a little

840
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:19,195
bit easier, cuz I'm like,
"I'm deep- part of DeepGram.

841
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:23,085
We're a speech to text API
company." So at least, like, I

842
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:28,215
can do the spiel. But
sometimes I don't -- I told

843
00:41:24,344 --> 00:41:28,215
a woman I liked her glasses
[chuckles].

844
00:41:29,545 --> 00:41:30,364
Dan: What's wrong with that?

845
00:41:30,644 --> 00:41:32,534
Bekah: No. That's how I
get to talk to people.

846
00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:33,164
Dan: Oh, sure. Yeah. Oh, yeah,
yeah.

847
00:41:33,164 --> 00:41:34,125
Bekah: Give them a compliment.

848
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,735
Dan: Sure. Yeah, yeah.
But I would say only

849
00:41:35,295 --> 00:41:38,835
compliment, yeah, clothes
and- and stuff, right? Like --

850
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:41,175
Bekah: Yeah. You have to be
careful what you compliment.

851
00:41:41,175 --> 00:41:42,000
Dan: Especially -- I mean,
especially if you're not a

852
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,394
wom- if you're not a woman.

853
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:43,700
Bekah: Yeah. Don't be like --

00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,125
Dan: It's just like, don't --

854
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:46,000
Bekah: You have really nice
eyes.

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Dan: [Chuckles] No, yeah.

00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Bekah: That will get creepy.

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Dan: That's ... yeah. Yeah, no.
I don't have

857
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,994
any good strategies cuz I'm
really bad at it [laughs] also.

858
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,349
I'd say, one- one strategy --

859
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:57,000
Bekah: You talk to
people at the table --

860
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,630
lunch table.

861
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,900
Dan: Sure. Sort of. 

00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,000
Bekah: Yeah.

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Dan: I mean, they were talking

862
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,700
to me [laughs]. Alright. What I
was gonna say was, if you go

863
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,000
with a friend, you know?

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,300
Bekah: Yeah.

00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,000
Dan: It's much easier to
actually

864
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
talk to other people if you ha-
already have somebody

865
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,500
that you're, like, with -- you
do know, because, like, we

866
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,000
sat -- Bekah and I sat next to
each other at the lunch table

867
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,420
and then, like, other people
just sat down, you know?

868
00:42:18,425 --> 00:42:21,329
And we weren't ...
like ... I don't know.

869
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,019
And then they -- we just, like,
started chat, you know?

870
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:26,190
And- and that's cool. It's ...
again, also hard for me

871
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:27,269
[chuckles]. I'm not- I'm not
good at it.

872
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:27,719
Bekah: Yeah.

873
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,405
Dan: I -- they're -- here, at
this conference, they're doing,

874
00:42:30,405 --> 00:42:33,405
like, a Bingo thing where
they're trying to get you to

875
00:42:33,405 --> 00:42:36,224
go to all the speaker table --
or the sponsor booths, that you

876
00:42:36,224 --> 00:42:39,704
can see some of them is behind
us. And -- so you have like

877
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:40,000
this little card, and you get
little stamps, you know, and

878
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,500
if you get 'em all, you get
entered in something. Raffle

879
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,775
for ... I don't know what.

880
00:42:44,835 --> 00:42:45,255
Bekah: Yeah, I don't know.

881
00:42:45,284 --> 00:42:47,614
Dan: But, anyway, so
now I'm going to all these

882
00:42:47,614 --> 00:42:49,000
booths that I don't have any
interest [chuckles] in going

883
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,085
to and trying

883
00:42:50,085 --> 00:42:54,300
to, like, make conversations.
Like, I feel bad just

884
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,500
being, like, stamp my thing,
okay, bye, you know?

885
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,295
And so, I'm always like, "So,
what do you guys do [laughs]?"

886
00:42:59,804 --> 00:43:01,605
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah, we got a lot
of that in our booth.

887
00:43:01,605 --> 00:43:02,000
Dan: I'm like- I'm like --

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,474
Bekah: It's okay.

888
00:43:02,474 --> 00:43:04,034
You don't have to talk to
me if you don't want to.

889
00:43:04,034 --> 00:43:05,355
Dan: Yeah. Well, one of the
people was like, "Have you heard

890
00:43:05,355 --> 00:43:10,065
of us?" I'm like, "No,
[inaudible] I haven't." I --

891
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:10,815
Bekah: That's awkward.

892
00:43:10,994 --> 00:43:13,769
Dan: And like, also, I'm not
looking for a job. And that's

893
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:15,630
one of the, like, a lot of
these people are here to hire.

894
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:19,000
Which makes a lot of sense.
But like ... I probably

895
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
wouldn't -- I don't know if
this is a common thing to,

896
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,380
like, get your thing stamped
at every booth thing.

897
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:28,860
But like, I imagine that a lot
of these booths are used to

898
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,510
the people that come up are
the people that are looking for

899
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,429
jobs. Because that's the reason
they're- they're here, you know?

900
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:36,000
And I'm like, "No, I don't."
They're like, "Whoa, we have

901
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
some positions available in
front-end." And I'm like, "Yeah,

902
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,525
I'm good," [laughs] you know?
Like, I don't know what to say.

903
00:43:42,974 --> 00:43:47,565
I don't -- I'm like, I don't
have the ... I dunno. I could

904
00:43:47,565 --> 00:43:51,764
feel like a lot of people are
just good at ... saying things

905
00:43:51,824 --> 00:43:54,135
in ways that make sense to
people [chuckles]? I dunno.

906
00:43:55,005 --> 00:43:56,684
Bekah: My dad, like, loves
talking to strangers.

907
00:43:56,715 --> 00:43:58,695
I talked to a stranger in the
airport and I texted him like,

908
00:43:58,695 --> 00:44:02,775
"Dad, you'll be so proud of me.
This- this guy used

909
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:04,815
to live in Pittsburgh, now
he lives in Atlanta, and

910
00:44:02,954 --> 00:44:07,244
he's been there for 10
years, and I had that whole

911
00:44:04,815 --> 00:44:07,000
conversation all by myself."

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,844
Dan: That's impressive, yeah.

912
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,614
Bekah: And he was like,
"Isn't that amazing?"

913
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:11,954
And I was like, "No, Dad. [Dan
laughs] It's not. I don't wanna

914
00:44:11,954 --> 00:44:15,255
do that all the time."
I mean, the guy was really

915
00:44:13,005 --> 00:44:17,355
nice, and- and I would've had
of more conversation with him,

916
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,355
but --

916
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,059
Dan: No, I- I didn't --

917
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:21,030
Bekah: I think, like,
getting involved too. Like, if

918
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:24,329
you're a speaker, then people
will talk to you?

919
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,550
So, that's a good way to do it?

920
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:30,600
Dan: Yeah. I mean like, yeah.
And that's -- I'd say, the

921
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,809
other times that I've
had fun at conferences,

922
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:36,000
I've been with the speakers.
Not because I was a speaker

923
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
necessarily, but like,
I just either knew the

924
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,059
organizers or whatever.

925
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:39,119
Bekah: Yeah.

926
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,489
Dan: And like -- or just, there-
there was one event in Florida

927
00:44:41,489 --> 00:44:44,534
that I went to, where they just
had their after party, whatever.

928
00:44:44,534 --> 00:44:47,414
And all -- of course, all the
speakers were there, and I- I

929
00:44:47,414 --> 00:44:50,000
just kinda, like, tagged along,
[chuckles], you know? And

930
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
ended up at a smaller thing.
And that's like, for me, I-

931
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I always -- I do much better
in smaller, like, settings,

932
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,215
you know? Like, smaller
groups of people or whatever.

933
00:44:58,215 --> 00:45:03,295
And so ... yeah. I'd- I'd say
... to go back to the

934
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,500
original question, right?
Your strategies for

935
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,000
this sort of thing.

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,300
Bekah: Yeah.

00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,275
Dan: My main strategy is bring-
bring your friend.

936
00:45:08,114 --> 00:45:09,284
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah.
It is really good.

937
00:45:09,284 --> 00:45:13,184
Last year, at KCDC, James Quick
was here. And I just like,

938
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:15,735
followed him around, like,
everywhere. With --

939
00:45:16,094 --> 00:45:18,585
Dan: Yeah. That's what I- that's
what I told Bekah, I was gonna

940
00:45:16,275 --> 00:45:20,025
do to Bekah. Except that she's
just sitting in this

941
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,045
booth the whole time [chuckles].
And that's less fun.

942
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:21,784
Bekah: Not the whole time.

943
00:45:22,085 --> 00:45:22,664
Dan: No, not the whole time.

944
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:23,000
Bekah: Some of the time
I'm not.

00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:23,700
Dan: Obviously right now-

00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,500
Bekah: And now I'm podcasting.

00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,155
Dan: -you're sitting right here-

00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:25,695
Bekah: Yeah.

946
00:45:25,695 --> 00:45:26,204
Dan: -which is cool.

947
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:27,855
Bekah: I gotta go back to
the booth after this though.

00:45:27,855 --> 00:45:28,605
Dan: Right. Yes. Yep.

948
00:45:28,605 --> 00:45:31,545
Bekah: But then tomorrow, I'm
free in the afternoon.

949
00:45:31,574 --> 00:45:33,454
Dan: Yeah. What was that?

950
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:37,000
Bekah: Yeah.
So, I would say bringing

951
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
your friend is nice. And it --
or it doesn't even have to be

952
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,500
like a 'friend' friend. Just
put it out there on Twitter

953
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,820
or whatever, social media,
like, "Hey, is anybody going?

954
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,690
Want to meet up?"

955
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,600
Dan: Yeah. Yep.
That's another

956
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:54,150
good strategy as well.
Yeah, I did the same thing-

957
00:45:54,179 --> 00:45:54,500
Bekah: Yeah.

00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,969
Dan: -with Rizél. I was trying
to get

958
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:57,000
her to come find us as lunch.
Cuz she was-

00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,000
Bekah: Yeah.

00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Dan: -she was at your talk,
and I didn't know that.

959
00:45:46,000 --> 00:46:01,600
And I probably
missed her, but anyway --

960
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,389
Bekah: It- it is hard when
you're by yourself.

961
00:46:03,449 --> 00:46:04,000
I- I mean-

00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,300
Dan: Yeah. I --

00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,070
Bekah: I've been to
conferences that were

962
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:09,809
terrible experiences.
Because like, there one -- I

963
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,039
can't remember which one it
was. Within the last year.

964
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,079
Like, I would go sit down at
the lunch table, and people

965
00:46:13,085 --> 00:46:15,179
would just like [laughs] stand
up and walk away. And then I'd

966
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:16,500
just be sitting there by
myself.

00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,000
Dan: Yeah.

00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,960
Bekah: I'm like, "Oh ... all
right.

967
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:20,800
I'm just gonna
continue to sit here-

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,090
Dan: Yeah.

968
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:21,739
Bekah: -by myself."

969
00:46:21,769 --> 00:46:23,000
Dan: Yeah, yeah. No. I -- when
I'm -- when I-

970
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,780
I've -- I think I've only gone
to one, like, big conference

971
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,710
by myself. And I just turned
into like a bold [??] person.

972
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:31,199
Like, I honestly, like, put my
headphones on, I'd read my book,

973
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:33,719
like, or something, you know?
Put my, like, op- open my

974
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:38,010
computer. I- I'm not good at it.
That's why it's nice

975
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,010
to have a friend, you know?

976
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:40,619
Bekah: The other thing would
be, you can talk

977
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:41,600
to speakers, you know?

978
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:41,800
Dan: Yeah.

979
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,000
Bekah: So if you are there
by yourself,

978
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,700
then go up to the speaker
and-

00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,000
Dan: Yeah.

00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,500
Bekah: -talk or, like, what
-- our-

979
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,070
our badges say if we're
speakers or- or not,

980
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:53,730
and what company ... oh, mine
doesn't say what

981
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:56,670
company I'm with.
Maybe cuz I'm a speaker.

982
00:46:56,699 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm not really sure. Does
yours?

00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,300
Dan: No.

00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,929
Bekah: No. Yours says attendee.

00:47:00,929 --> 00:47:02,000
Dan: I'm an attendee --

983
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,050
Bekah: Well, you can just go up
to him and be like, "So, I see

984
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:05,099
you're an attendee too
[laughs]."

985
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:08,000
Dan: [Laughs] Yeah.
That's the kind of thing

986
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
that I imagine saying.
And then, you know,

987
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,179
realize it's a bad idea,
and then, you know --

988
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:13,769
Bekah: Jokes are a good way.

989
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:16,079
Just go up to somebody random
and tell them a joke.

990
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:17,280
I think that's a good idea.

991
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:23,280
Dan: I -- my- my-
father-in-law is the same

992
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,349
way I think i-is your Dad but --
and he'll do the same thing.

993
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:27,449
He'll do drop a joke or
like, just random, you know,

994
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:31,000
thing, or make a comment.
And like -- one time, he- one

995
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
time, he was -- this is on --
we were on vacation, heard a

996
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
lady talking to her friend
at the grocery store. And was

997
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,769
like, she was telling some --
it wasn't like a personal --

998
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:42,449
it was a personal story,
but not like a- not like

999
00:47:42,449 --> 00:47:44,000
a, you know, private story.

00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,300
Bekah: Yeah.

00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,500
Dan: But like -- and then saw
her at some other

1000
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,175
store, like, later, and he was
like, "Hey, how about that thingy

1001
00:47:50,175 --> 00:47:50,744
thing?" You know?

1002
00:47:50,925 --> 00:47:51,585
Bekah: Oh, that's creepy!
[Laughs]

1003
00:47:52,344 --> 00:47:53,925
Dan: Oh, yeah, I know. I'm
like, "That's a horrible act."

1004
00:47:54,224 --> 00:47:56,905
And he's like, "Yeah.
And she- she acted kind

1005
00:47:55,034 --> 00:47:59,715
of weird about it." [All laugh]
I'm like, "Yeah, no kidding,

1006
00:48:01,994 --> 00:48:03,000
man." So, don't do that.

00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,500
Bekah: No.

00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,635
Dan: Yeah. I mean --

1007
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:08,505
Bekah: That's why I
bolt my door shut-

00:48:08,505 --> 00:48:06,105
Dan: Right [laughs].

1008
00:48:06,105 --> 00:48:09,795
Bekah: -in the hotel. And stack
up furniture against the door.

1009
00:48:09,795 --> 00:48:12,045
Dan: And he's not creepy.
That's the- that's the

1010
00:48:10,635 --> 00:48:14,744
thing, you know? He's
just like ... he thought it

1011
00:48:12,045 --> 00:48:16,000
would be funny, you know?
And ... it wasn't.

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Bekah: That's not.

1012
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,094
Dan: He didn't keep following
her. So --

1013
00:48:21,644 --> 00:48:23,000
Bekah: [Laughs] Start again,
a year later and brought

00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,804
it up again?

1014
00:48:24,755 --> 00:48:25,784
Dan: Right.
Showed up at her house.

1015
00:48:26,835 --> 00:48:31,815
Anyway ... sorry, Phil. [Bekah
laughs] That was -- I love you.

1017
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:36,179
Dan: Do we have
any more questions?

1018
00:48:36,269 --> 00:48:39,989
Bekah: Okay.
Travis followed up, "But I

1019
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:42,809
always like slapping language
and framework stickers on

1020
00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:45,179
things, but they seem better
for keeping the conversation

1021
00:48:42,809 --> 00:48:48,389
going than starting it." Yeah.
That can be a good way to do it.

1022
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:48,690
Dan: What?

1023
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:54,210
Bekah: Like, language or
framework stickers? Like, talking

1024
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:58,619
about those things that you do?
Like, as a conversation starter.

1025
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,539
Like, if my water bottle had
a-

1026
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:01,239
Dan: Oh --

1027
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:03,000
Bekah: -React sticker on it --

00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Dan: Talk to me about --

1028
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Bekah: "Oh, you know React too.
Hey."

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,800
Dan: Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.

00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,200
Bekah: Yeah.

00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:07,769
Dan: That's cool.

1029
00:49:08,429 --> 00:49:12,554
Yeah. I -- yeah.
That's a good idea.

1030
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:19,905
I was -- [chuckles] I started
talking about Tailwind to one of

1031
00:49:19,905 --> 00:49:21,735
the sponsor booths that I was
having random conversations

1032
00:49:21,735 --> 00:49:25,574
with, and I- I -- pretty sure
I bored them cuz I just, like,

1033
00:49:25,574 --> 00:49:27,000
saw their eyes crossing
[laughs]. Not bored them, but,

00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,394
like, I went off on a

1034
00:49:28,394 --> 00:49:31,000
Tailwind tangent. And they
were not interested in

00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,425
that content [laughs].

1035
00:49:33,195 --> 00:49:35,235
Bekah: You can also go up
to each of the booths and

1036
00:49:35,235 --> 00:49:37,155
practice a different accent.

1037
00:49:37,605 --> 00:49:37,695
Dan: Ooh.

1038
00:49:38,284 --> 00:49:40,304
Bekah: So, try the
same conversation-

1039
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:40,824
Dan: [With thick accent] Oh,
yeah.

1040
00:49:40,905 --> 00:49:43,094
Bekah: in a different
accent every time [laughs].

1041
00:49:43,755 --> 00:49:45,284
Dan: How- how many accents?
What ac- what accent do you got?

1042
00:49:45,284 --> 00:49:46,244
What's your --

1043
00:49:46,244 --> 00:49:48,315
Bekah: Oh, I don't do -- I
can't do any accents.

1044
00:49:48,324 --> 00:49:49,000
Dan: [With accent] You can't
do any accents?

00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,200
Bekah: No.

00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,954
Dan: [With accent] You can't
do a German accent?

1045
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:52,000
Bekah: No!

00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,525
Dan: What about --

1046
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:58,244
Bekah: Ambrose is really good.
He's been practicing his British

1047
00:49:58,244 --> 00:49:58,724
accent.

1048
00:49:59,105 --> 00:50:02,644
Dan: At the, "[With accent] Get
to the chopper," you know?

1049
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:02,000
"[With accent] We need to do
the -- we need to add the

00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,210
React to the Remix. Now!
Bekah!" [Laughs]

1050
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,170
Bekah: I'm not-
I'm not gonna try.

1051
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,699
I'm not even. I was
thinking about it.

1052
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:14,159
Like, "I think I can do that."
I can't do that.

1053
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:16,889
Dan: Every time
I think I can speak

1054
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:18,090
in a British accent,
it does not go well.

1055
00:50:18,094 --> 00:50:19,800
I- I feel like I need
to get warmed up on a British

1056
00:50:19,804 --> 00:50:20,099
accent.

1057
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:22,000
Bekah: I like mixed British
and Australian-

00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,000
Dan: Well- well, I'm not
saying --

1058
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Bekah: -but I hear that that
is not uncommon.

00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Like, my coworker, my teammate
is ... he is from England.

00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,300
Dan: Uh-huh.

00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,000
Bekah: And he said, whenever
he's in

1060
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,565
the US, people either think
he's from Australia or England.

1061
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:38,000
They're not usually really sure.
And he asked the -- one of

1062
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
the people when we were
together, she was like,

1063
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,315
"Oh, that accent." He was like,
"Where do you think I'm from?"

1064
00:50:42,315 --> 00:50:45,525
And she was like, "It's
either British or Australian."

1065
00:50:45,525 --> 00:50:47,385
[Dan laughs] I was like,
"Yep."

1066
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:51,885
Dan: Yeah. I had -- when I --
when -- I went to

1067
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:58,275
Scotlands, like, a long
time ago ... before kids.

1068
00:50:59,324 --> 00:51:01,545
So, more than six years
ago [chuckles], I don't know.

1069
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:04,414
I don't know how much more --
but -- no, I really

1070
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:07,054
practiced it when I was there.
I had -- I felt like I had a

1071
00:51:04,414 --> 00:51:08,000
pretty good Scottish -- go --
oh, no. It's pass the thing.

1072
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I think- I think it keeps
recording. I think it's just

00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,335
a screensaver.

1073
00:51:15,335 --> 00:51:16,835
I think it keeps recording
when it does that but

1074
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,000
I didn't wanna risk it.
Anyway ... yeah, I had a good

1075
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,275
Scottish accent going for
a while.

1076
00:51:21,635 --> 00:51:23,500
Learned some good words here.
Have you heard the

00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,034
word 'shuggled'?

1077
00:51:24,784 --> 00:51:25,114
Bekah: What?

1078
00:51:25,155 --> 00:51:28,715
Dan: Shuggled. Shuggled
is like ... shaken, you know?

1079
00:51:28,894 --> 00:51:28,954
Bekah: Oh.

1080
00:51:28,954 --> 00:51:31,934
Dan: Like- like shooken up,
you know? As a bus driver was

1081
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,545
driving over some bumpy stuff
and then -- and- and she was

1082
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:37,000
like -- something about, "Sorry
to keep you all shuggled,"

00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,275
or something. [Laughs]

1083
00:51:38,894 --> 00:51:40,574
It was- it was really fun.
I like accents.

1084
00:51:40,605 --> 00:51:42,195
I'm not, like, good at
practicing them, but ...

1085
00:51:42,344 --> 00:51:44,700
that's a good idea.

1086
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,284
Bekah: Yeah.

00:51:45,775 --> 00:51:46,300
Dan: All right.

00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,059
Bekah: Practice your accents.

1087
00:51:47,059 --> 00:51:49,244
Dan: I feel like the German
one is my go-to.

1088
00:51:49,514 --> 00:51:50,000
Bekah: That's a good one.

00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,545
Dan: It's like a ... quirky
German. Do you know it?

1089
00:51:52,844 --> 00:51:53,465
Bekah: Quirky German? [laughs]

1090
00:51:53,469 --> 00:51:54,614
Dan: Yeah.
Not like a serious German.

1091
00:51:54,795 --> 00:51:59,775
There's like serious German.
And there's like, you

1092
00:51:55,844 --> 00:52:01,000
know ... fun, silly German.
It's like Hans and Franz, you

1093
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,505
know, from "Saturday Night
Live".

1094
00:52:02,804 --> 00:52:03,224
Bekah: Mm-mm.

1095
00:52:03,224 --> 00:52:03,554
Dan: Bekah.

1096
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:08,025
Bekah: "Saturday Night Live"
is on too late.

1097
00:52:09,315 --> 00:52:12,045
Dan: I mean, it's from when we
were like kids. So it's not like

1098
00:52:12,434 --> 00:52:12,704
nothing very much live --

1099
00:52:13,065 --> 00:52:13,961
Bekah: I only know
the cheerleaders.

1100
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:15,300
Dan: The cheerleaders?

00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:15,500
Bekah: Yeah.

00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,050
Dan: Like [inaudible] --

1101
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,700
Bekah: [Soft cheering] Tacos.
Burritos. What's coming outta

00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,019
your speedos. [Dan laughs]

1102
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,329
There's Bobby Fisher. Where is
he? I don't know.

1103
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:24,000
I don't know.

00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Dan: Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember
that one. That's a good one.

00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,000
Bekah: That's -- those -- and

1104
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,440
get off the shed.
I used to like that.

1105
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:32,400
That was Chris Farley, I think?

1106
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:37,000
Dan: I don't know that one,
But anyway, we've gone-

00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,469
Bekah: Yes.

1107
00:52:37,469 --> 00:52:41,369
Dan: -way off the beaten path
here [laughs]. Thanks, Travis.

1108
00:52:40,469 --> 00:52:41,369
I'm blaming with Travis for
that one.

1109
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:41,610
Bekah: Yeah.

1110
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:44,565
Dan: Alright. Is that the
last-

1111
00:52:44,565 --> 00:52:45,000
Bekah: I think I -- we're-

00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,300
Dan: -question?

1112
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,284
Bekah: -that -- we've covered
everything.

1113
00:52:48,614 --> 00:52:55,000
Dan: Okay. Alright.
I was kind of ... expecting

1114
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,554
some of our friends to stop
by and say hi, but nobody did.

1115
00:52:57,735 --> 00:52:59,655
Bekah: Well, it's also really
hard to hear.

1116
00:53:00,014 --> 00:53:01,800
Dan: Well, sure. But I thought
they would coming --

1117
00:53:00,525 --> 00:53:02,894
Bekah: And I know
that they're at talk -- number

1118
00:53:02,894 --> 00:53:04,155
of them are at talks. So --

1119
00:53:05,445 --> 00:53:08,025
Dan: Yeah. Alright, cool.
Well, this was ... fun.

1120
00:53:08,204 --> 00:53:10,605
Bekah: This was an
excellent in-person-

00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:11,500
Dan: I hope that the --

1121
00:53:10,784 --> 00:53:11,864
Bekah: -podcast experience.

1122
00:53:11,864 --> 00:53:13,500
Dan: Yes. It was excellent.
I'm sorry that we weren't

1123
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,875
able to live stream it. But ...
well, if you listen to this --

1124
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:17,534
Bekah: We did our best.

1125
00:53:17,534 --> 00:53:19,065
Dan: If you listened to this,
then I've already published it.

1126
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:20,715
So I don't need to talk about
when I'm gonna publish it.

1127
00:53:20,715 --> 00:53:21,284
Bekah: Yes.

1128
00:53:21,405 --> 00:53:23,445
Dan: Cool. Cool, cool.
Co-cool, cool, cool.

1129
00:53:23,835 --> 00:53:26,300
Bekah: All right. And we'll be
back next week with another

00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:26,594
podcast [laughs].

1130
00:53:26,985 --> 00:53:29,000
Dan: I don't -- I'm -- yeah.
I'm having some technical issues

1131
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
with Descript and trying to get
that last -- trying to get

00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Bogdan's out. So --

1132
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,144
Bekah:  Yeah. So if anybody
works at Descript --

1133
00:53:34,425 --> 00:53:37,005
Dan: Yep. Hopefully, we'll get
that sorted out soon.

1134
00:53:37,635 --> 00:53:39,074
Bekah: Oh, actually I know
someone that works at Descript.

1135
00:53:39,465 --> 00:53:39,974
Dan: Excellent.

1136
00:53:41,684 --> 00:53:42,105
Bekah: All right.

1137
00:53:42,195 --> 00:53:42,824
Dan: [Laughs] Have them call
me.

1138
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:47,264
Bekah: As usual,
we're very good at concluding

1139
00:53:45,164 --> 00:53:47,474
our podcast episode.

1140
00:53:47,655 --> 00:53:50,224
Dan: Yes. This is been the
Virtual Coffee podcast --

1141
00:53:50,565 --> 00:53:51,105
Bekah: Live edition.

1142
00:53:51,105 --> 00:53:52,844
Dan: Live ... edition

00:53:52,934 --> 00:53:53,700
Bekah: Live from-

00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,500
Dan: Live from --

00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,144
Bekah: -Kansas City.

1144
00:53:55,144 --> 00:54:01,000
Dan: Beautiful Kansas City.
And ... I've seen about two

1145
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
square feet of it [laughs]
because the hotel is right next

1146
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,599
to the conference center, but
it's been cool so far. So --

1147
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:08,070
Bekah: Love Kansas city.

1148
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:08,340
Dan: Yes.

1149
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,000
Bekah: It's a good place.

1150
00:54:09,269 --> 00:54:14,000
Dan: We'll be back ... [whisper]
tomorrow? No. Wednesday? I'll be

1151
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
back Wednesday night. So --

00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,000
Bekah: Yeah.

00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,269
Dan: Is that when you're going

1152
00:54:18,269 --> 00:54:21,840
back? Wednesday early?
or Thurs- or Tuesday?

1153
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,590
Bekah: I leave on Wednesday.

1154
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:24,700
Dan: Yeah. Alright, cool.
Well --

00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,000
Bekah: All right.

1155
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,315
Dan: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you [laughs].
