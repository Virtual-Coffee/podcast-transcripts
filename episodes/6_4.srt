00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:09,516
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season six, episode four of the

2
00:00:09,516 --> 00:00:15,214
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:18,693
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:21,393
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:24,094
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:27,213
stories and what they've learned.
And we're here to share it with

7
00:00:27,213 --> 00:00:30,814
you here with me. Today is my
cohost. Dan

8
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:35,914
Dan: Wuddup, Bek? How's it going?

9
00:00:36,844 --> 00:00:38,433
Bekah: It it's going wonderfully.

10
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:45,694
Dan: Excellent. Um, today we are
talking with Sadie J who is a,

11
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:48,993
uh, frontend developer with a
federal agency. We talked about

12
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:54,314
her long experience doing the
interview process and yeah, and

13
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:56,834
her experience working at a
government agency as well.

14
00:00:56,954 --> 00:01:00,179
Bekah: Yeah, it was really
interesting to hear how she kind

15
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:04,528
of started in tech. She burnt out
and left tech for a while and

16
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:08,278
then decided to give it a second
shot and she's back doing it

17
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:11,308
again. And it sounds like she's
really excited, but also like.

18
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:14,444
Took those lessons that she
learned from that burnout

19
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:18,284
experience and brought them with
her. So she doesn't get burnout

20
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:21,343
again. And I think that's really,
really useful because I see that

21
00:01:21,343 --> 00:01:22,513
happen to a lot of people.

22
00:01:23,364 --> 00:01:26,054
Dan: Yeah, totally. I, it was, it
was interesting hearing her talk

23
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:29,864
about, um, Her thought process,
you know, when she was

24
00:01:29,864 --> 00:01:34,903
experiencing the burnout stuff
and, um, and just taking a break

25
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:38,114
like that, uh, you know, and
dealing with it head on, uh, I

26
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:40,364
think was, was really cool. And I
think there's a lot of valuable

27
00:01:40,364 --> 00:01:41,084
stuff in there.

28
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:44,914
Bekah: Yep. And we start every
episode of the podcast. Like we

29
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:48,243
start every Virtual Coffee. We
introduce ourselves with our

30
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:51,993
name, where we're from, what we
do and a random check-in

31
00:01:52,054 --> 00:02:04,209
question. And we hope you enjoy
this episode. Hi, I'm Bekah. I am

32
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:10,299
a technical community builder
from a small town in Ohio and an

33
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,028
imaginary class that I wish was
offered. I feel like this is hard

34
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:21,748
because I'm not sure what would
be practical for an imaginary

35
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:29,218
class and maybe imaginary
classes. Aren't practical. um,

36
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:32,593
Dan: class teach imaginary things
or is this like a chance to

37
00:02:32,593 --> 00:02:33,193
learn, you know,

38
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:39,299
Bekah: oh, for sure it can teach
imaginary things. Yeah, I think I

39
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:47,618
would like to, um, definitely
take a class that watches people

40
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:54,633
have brain scans. And that's not
an imaginary class. I'm kind of

41
00:02:54,633 --> 00:03:00,123
like neurobiology class. Um, but
there's gotta be some kind of

42
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:11,508
imaginary aspect to brain scans
and people. really bad at this

43
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:15,498
question. I was the one that
chose it too. So it just like

44
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:19,218
makes it worse. Um, I'm just
gonna like look at people's

45
00:03:19,218 --> 00:03:24,408
brains and see what they do.
That's it. It's not imaginary.

46
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:28,248
It's wishful. That's what I wish
I wish to watch people's brains.

47
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:31,739
Dan: Less of a class and more of
a profession you wish you had

48
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:37,218
Bekah: Um, yes, I would love to
be a neurobiologist that would.

49
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:41,989
Fantastic. What? Okay. Maybe an
imaginary class on like studying

50
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,408
black holes by like actually
physically exploring them cuz

51
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:50,568
that's not possible. So is that
better?

52
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:54,079
Dan: I don't know. I don't know
what to do with this question.

53
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:59,239
Um, hi, I'm Dan. I do computer
development things, uh, in

54
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:03,378
Cleveland and, um, yeah,
imaginary class. I have no, I

55
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:08,269
mean, I don't really understand
this question to tell truth I,

56
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:14,239
uh, I don't know. Um, I guess I'm
gonna go with, uh, um, like

57
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:19,278
spaceship, flying yeah. but like
not the boring ones that we have

58
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:21,319
that are reality though, you
know? Or like star

59
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:22,038
Bekah: Star wars,

60
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:23,538
Dan: like yeah. Yeah. Like teach
me

61
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:24,918
Bekah: good imaginary class.

62
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:26,569
Dan: the Millennium Falcon or
something, you know, that'd be

63
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:26,778
cool.

64
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,218
Bekah: Yeah,

65
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:31,158
Dan: long as I actually got to
fly it. All right. That's gonna

66
00:04:31,158 --> 00:04:31,728
be my answer.

67
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:38,014
Sadie: Okay. Um, hi, I'm Sadie.
Um, I'm from a small town in the

68
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:42,514
panhandle of Florida. I am a
front end developer for a federal

69
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:49,774
agency and, uh, an imaginary
class. I think I would take, I

70
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:52,863
don't know. I, this makes me
think of like when I was in

71
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,244
elementary school and like super
obsessed with like ESP and like

72
00:04:57,274 --> 00:05:01,744
being psychic and things like
that. So I would probably. Some

73
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:03,663
class that develops like your
psychic abilities.

74
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:06,319
Bekah: I

75
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:06,619
Dan: I like

76
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:09,798
Bekah: that is a good, an, an
excellent answer. You have

77
00:05:09,803 --> 00:05:13,769
definitely won this round of
intro questions.

78
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:19,428
Dan: Yeah. My first answer was
gonna be like, learn, you know,

79
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:20,569
learn the Force, you know?

80
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:21,384
Bekah: Mm,

81
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:24,319
Dan: then I was thinking about
spaceships would be fun too, so,

82
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:27,949
and a little more practical. I
was worried that I think that,

83
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:32,778
uh, canonically. You have to
like, have the, be able to use

84
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:35,119
the force to learn. Like, it's
not like everybody can learn it,

85
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:38,329
you know, a bummer to sign up for
that class and they get there and

86
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:42,319
then find out you can't, can't.
Right,

87
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:45,064
Bekah: you can watch everybody
else use the force, but you're

88
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:45,334
stuck.

89
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:48,108
Dan: right, right. I don't feel
like everybody can use, uh,

90
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:51,108
everybody could use, uh, or learn
how to fly spaceships.

91
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:54,139
Bekah: I feel like I want a class
on communicating with aliens, but

92
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:57,649
I feel like DARPA already has
that or something like it's out

93
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:02,781
there. We just don't know about
it yet. um, well welcome Sadie.

94
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:06,122
Thanks for being here with us
today. We're very, very excited

95
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:10,041
to have you, and we always like
to start off with your tech

96
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:13,762
origin story. So how did you get
to this point in your tech?

97
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:21,516
Sadie: Oh, wow. Yeah. That's um,
a good question. I feel like it

98
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:25,956
was a winding journey for sure.
Um, Like, I, I didn't really grow

99
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:32,137
up with a desire to be in tech.
Uh, like my household computer

100
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,406
was just the computer that let me
get on cartoon network.com and

101
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:41,797
play games. like, it wasn't much
past that, but, um, I would say

102
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:48,276
right after I graduated, um, with
my bachelor's degree in

103
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:53,932
psychology, I got into drawing
and painting. Like, and this was

104
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:57,112
just like a random desire that I
had. I was like, ah, I just wanna

105
00:06:57,112 --> 00:07:02,391
learn painting. I'm just gonna
take a class. So I did and like

106
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:07,312
fell in love. And from that I
wanted to like find a career that

107
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:12,141
let me combine psychology and
like drawing or visual arts. So I

108
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:15,951
was like, okay, maybe web design
somehow. Cuz that would also let

109
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:21,192
me work remotely and give me some
flexibility. So I went to a boot.

110
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:25,927
Um, I went to skill crush and
signed up for one of their

111
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:28,956
courses. It was like a web design
course or visual design course.

112
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:36,187
This was back in like 2017, like
several years ago, but I wanted

113
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:38,677
to like test out the waters to
see if that was something I would

114
00:07:38,682 --> 00:07:44,137
be interested and like, it, it
seemed good enough. Like, I, I

115
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:47,317
felt like I could do it. So then
I signed up for my master, my

116
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:52,101
master's, um, Specializing in web
design and online communication.

117
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:57,081
And in that program, like we did
both web design and also web

118
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:01,072
development. And I realized that
like, actually web development

119
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:06,891
was more my thing and not so much
the web design. Um, so yeah, so

120
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:11,122
that was like the, really the
kickoff to my tech journey, for

121
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:15,351
sure. But after I graduated, I,
there was another pivot, like.

122
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:20,317
Was completely burnt out on tech
and anything tech related. Like I

123
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:24,966
couldn't bear to think about like
coding. And I remember like I

124
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:29,257
applied to some internship and
got elite code challenge, but at

125
00:08:29,257 --> 00:08:32,736
the time I didn't know what that
was. So I was like, oh wow. I

126
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:35,437
just graduated with this degree.
And like, I can't even use it.

127
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:40,206
Like, I don't know what, like how
to do this thing with JavaScript

128
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:44,106
that they want me to do. So it
just completely like demoralize

129
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:48,621
me and. Like crushed my
confidence. So I became a yoga

130
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:52,701
teacher. I was out in Brooklyn
and doing that like yoga life and

131
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:57,231
like meeting with cool people.
And then I got into the travel

132
00:08:57,231 --> 00:09:02,692
industry and did that for a year,
but all of that ended around 2020

133
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:07,192
when I left the job and then the
pandemic started and all that. So

134
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:13,086
it gave me time to reflect and. I
had to move back home after being

135
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,267
in Brooklyn for a few years. And
I really thought, I was like,

136
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:20,496
okay, what am I gonna do next?
Cuz like, I don't want to be here

137
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,736
like Florida, which is home for
me. Like I don't wanna be here

138
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:27,277
forever, but I do wanna take the
time to like make sure that like

139
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:33,547
I'm going in a direction that I
feel good about and kind of came

140
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:40,687
to the conclusion that like, I
didn't really give tech a try. I,

141
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:45,547
I let the burnout like kind of
like take over. I don't know, I

142
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:52,417
guess like my direction or just
like, I dunno, just had me stop

143
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,996
in my tracks. So I was like, you
know what, I'm gonna give this a

144
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:59,647
college try, like, I'm a, I'm
gonna do this again. And this

145
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:03,547
time I'm going to make sure I
have community around me. And

146
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:07,912
that's how I found. Y'all how I
found virtual. So I restarted my

147
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:11,631
boot camp, restarted school crush
and did the front end developer

148
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:15,892
intensive. But this time was very
intentional about joining

149
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:19,642
community, like being very active
in Virtual Coffee, and I wanted

150
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:23,991
to do the open source thing. So
it would just so happen that, um,

151
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:31,971
the kickoff for the October Fest,
um, month was like a week or two

152
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:34,807
away. So that's when I joined
butcher coffee. I got to sit in

153
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:38,407
and watch Dan do the, um, like
how to contribute to open source

154
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:44,376
and yeah. So it, it all just went
from there. Uh, yeah, so I ended

155
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:47,647
up like contributing to like five
projects and like, I contributed

156
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,976
to a couple of IBM projects. I
got to do a demo day with them

157
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:58,537
and then, um, side of the job
search or in like February. And

158
00:10:58,956 --> 00:11:02,437
that was another beast of its own
where it took like nine weeks.

159
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:08,317
and just hundreds of applications
to get this job that I have now.

160
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:10,927
And yeah. That's how I got here.
Yeah,

161
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:17,692
Bekah: That's awesome. I love
that story. I. There's just, um,

162
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:24,741
I like that you have gone through
a lot of different, like

163
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:28,312
different journeys on this
journey here. Right? Um, you've

164
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,402
done a lot of different things,
but also like coming back from

165
00:11:31,402 --> 00:11:35,932
burnout, I imagine that's gotta
be kind of a hard decision to

166
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:41,782
make what really kind of pushed
you in that direction. Like,

167
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:44,331
okay, fine. I'm gonna do this one
more.

168
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:49,792
Sadie: Right. That's that's a
good question. I think one time

169
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:55,701
time helped cuz I had graduated
2018 and then I felt like I could

170
00:11:55,701 --> 00:12:00,532
entertain the thought of tech
again, like. Few years later. So

171
00:12:00,532 --> 00:12:06,412
2021. So really it was just time
and space that helped, I would

172
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:11,721
say for the most part, but also,
I don't know. I know, like I

173
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:16,042
wanted flexibility in my job and
like where I worked, like that

174
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:19,912
was also the catalyst of going
into the master's degree program.

175
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:24,201
So like, I think that thread just
continued and I was like, okay, I

176
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:28,672
think I could do tech again.
Because I've tried, like also

177
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:31,942
tried writing on the side a
little bit, but that didn't feel

178
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:38,841
quite as a fit. So I think just,
I dunno, the reflection and

179
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:43,522
wanting to like challenge myself
and see something to completion

180
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:44,392
also helped.

181
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:48,703
Dan: Can you talk a little bit
about, um, your experience? Uh,

182
00:12:48,823 --> 00:12:53,234
so if I have this right, you did
the bootcamp and then you went to

183
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:56,803
a master's program after that. So
that's like a lot of school, like

184
00:12:56,808 --> 00:13:00,104
in all together. Can you talk, I
don't think I've actually, we've

185
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:03,923
talked to anybody who is. Learn
web design stuff or web

186
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:07,524
development stuff in a master's
program. Um, could you, would you

187
00:13:07,524 --> 00:13:11,033
mind sharing a little bit about
what that was like? Um, and, and

188
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,283
especially like, compared to,
since you did it right after the

189
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:16,823
bootcamp, maybe, maybe compared
to what, what it was like, um,

190
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,193
you know, the different
approaches and everything.

191
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:24,203
Sadie: Yeah. So, okay. So I did
the boot. And I, I don't even

192
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:28,313
know if I completed the course.
Um, like before I did the

193
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:31,464
master's, like, it was just
enough to be like, okay, this

194
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:35,994
seems like something I could do.
So I went into my master's

195
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:40,673
program without any knowledge of
code or anything, but that was

196
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:44,604
the, um, like the setup for the
degree. Like, you didn't have to

197
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:50,364
have any prior knowledge. Um, but
I don't know. I don't, I kind of

198
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:56,859
don't know how. like give more
details, cuz it was it like

199
00:13:56,859 --> 00:14:03,188
college, like you, um, like we
had four classes a semester.

200
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:06,879
That's what I signed up for. And
like the very first class was

201
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:13,058
like a web design principles and
like it went into HTML and maybe

202
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:15,639
a little bit of CSS and I don't
even think we touched JavaScript

203
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,553
that much in that first class.
And then it built up from. Um, we

204
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:23,063
learned like it was mostly do in
manipulation, cuz it, it wasn't

205
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:27,173
like a computer science class, so
we didn't learn like algorithms

206
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:30,293
or data structures or anything
like that. But basically like how

207
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:36,293
to create websites and like
webpages with an I for design.

208
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:44,514
Um, we also learn like Adobe
suite and um, social media and

209
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:48,818
like analytics for websites and
things like. like the capstone

210
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:56,078
project was to create a WordPress
site for a local company. And our

211
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:01,389
cohort was divided up into teams.
And that was like, that was the,

212
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:06,519
the peak, like the end of the
program. But I say all that to

213
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:12,339
say like, so I did that finished
in 2018 and then went back into

214
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:19,719
the boot camp 2021. And. I, I
feel like I retained enough

215
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:23,408
information, but it was enough to
know that like, oh yeah, I

216
00:15:23,408 --> 00:15:30,038
remember learning that in school.
So I felt like what I learned in

217
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:33,339
the bootcamp and what I learned
in school were comparable, but it

218
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:37,538
was just that I had more time in
school to learn the things and to

219
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:42,639
like, kind of like dive into each
thing that was taught, like each

220
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:47,964
aspect of HTML or CSS or Javas.
whereas the bootcamp was like

221
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:52,163
basically the same topics, but
just in a more condensed, um,

222
00:15:52,224 --> 00:15:57,894
time space, even though it was
self-paced. So, yeah, it was

223
00:15:57,894 --> 00:15:58,524
really interesting.

224
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,683
Dan: Yeah, I guess it makes
sense.

225
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:06,129
Bekah: The, so after you did the
master's program, then you went

226
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:11,198
into the bootcamp. Um, was there
any interview prep that you did

227
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:14,739
as part of the master's program
or was that, did you do that in

228
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:14,918
the.

229
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:23,649
Sadie: No. Yeah, no for the
master's program. Absolutely not.

230
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:27,759
Um, and I feel like that's why,
like, I was so blindsided by the

231
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:35,048
lead code challenge, but yeah.
What, um, the, the like real

232
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:40,239
world, um, aspect of the bootcamp
or not. The bootcamp of the

233
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:43,568
master's degree was like a
internship. So I did an

234
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:48,698
internship at, um, American
documentary POV, a media company.

235
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:53,589
And I'm, I'm smiling because
like, I don't y'all can't see me,

236
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:57,889
but I'm smiling and I'm laughing
because like, it was an

237
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:01,899
internship. In the digital team,
but it didn't have anything to do

238
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:05,108
with like the website or
anything. So I had to like

239
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:08,439
shoehorn, like, Hey, I need to do
something with WordPress. I need

240
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:12,338
to do something. But what it
ended up being was more like me

241
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:16,628
working with the producers and
doing like other cool stuff. But

242
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:19,298
yeah, no, that was the extent of
like the real world application

243
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:23,798
for the, um, master's program. So
I was like completely lost when I

244
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:27,578
was job hunting and. Yeah,

245
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,993
Bekah: I think most people are
completely lost when they're job

246
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:34,114
hunting. You know, it's just
like, there's not a lot of

247
00:17:34,114 --> 00:17:37,804
preparation and job interviews
are all over the place. So you

248
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:41,943
just never know what to expect.
And like having to prepare so

249
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:46,263
much for each one of them makes
it really, really hard. Did you

250
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:48,453
do interview prep with skill
crush?

251
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:53,019
Sadie: I did. Yeah. So the front
end developer intensive includes,

252
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:59,409
um, a job hunting. Coach like a
career coach that helps you, like

253
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:04,088
prepare your resume and like
prepare your cover letter and get

254
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:09,068
your like one minute, like, uh,
what's it called? Like a one

255
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:12,489
minute, like spiel about yourself
and I don't know, just interview,

256
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:15,608
practice and how to answer
questions. Exactly. Elevator

257
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:19,989
pitch. Um, yeah, so crush had
that and that really opened my

258
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:26,138
eyes to like how to be strategic
when job hunting. like, kind of

259
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:28,898
like understand what to expect
when interviewing in the tech

260
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:33,909
field and yeah, without that, I,
I really don't think I would've,

261
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:38,798
uh, or it, it either would've
taken me a lot longer to find my

262
00:18:38,804 --> 00:18:44,078
job or I would've stopped again.
And probably would've said maybe

263
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:45,048
text, just not for.

264
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:49,304
Bekah: Yeah. And that's so
unfortunate that there are so

265
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:53,534
many people trying to break into
tech and are just quitting before

266
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:57,344
they get there, because the inter
and the interview process is not

267
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,693
reflective of most of the stuff
that you're. To be doing.

268
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:05,753
Sadie: And like, without that
knowledge of like, oh, like I

269
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:10,554
actually don't maybe need to know
how to like, do this leak Cody

270
00:19:10,554 --> 00:19:16,314
thing. Like if you don't have
that understanding, then. I feel

271
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:19,134
like that's what feels like the,
the tutorial loop where like, oh,

272
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:23,364
I need to know how to do this
weird niche thing. Or like, maybe

273
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:27,144
I actually don't know enough, so
I need to keep going. Like, I

274
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:30,804
don't know. It, the interview
process is so like demoralizing

275
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:32,034
or it can be.

276
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:35,814
Bekah: That's a really good word
for, I even think like some of

277
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:40,703
the best interview processes are
still very exhausting and tough

278
00:19:40,703 --> 00:19:46,644
to get through. So why don't you,
can you walk us through what it

279
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,534
was like to prepare for an
interview?

280
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:54,909
Sadie: Oh, that's a good
question. um, Hmm. That's a good

281
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:59,423
question. I feel like. What I did
would be to like, look at the job

282
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:02,213
website and like, look at the
people that I'm interviewing with

283
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:04,824
and like kind of stock their
Instagram or not Instagram

284
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:09,743
they're LinkedIn. I dunno why I
said Instagram, but, um, yeah,

285
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:13,044
stock their LinkedIn a little bit
and try to find like some sort of

286
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:18,173
commonality that I may have with
them and have the idea to bring

287
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:23,003
it up, even though like I'm, uh,
really shy and I probably won't

288
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:26,378
ever bring up like, Hey, Looked
at your LinkedIn. And I noticed

289
00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:29,739
like, I'm not that kind of
person, but just having that like

290
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:33,128
background behind that person
that I'm gonna be interviewing,

291
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:38,318
um, helped me feel a little more
confident. Um, I would also try

292
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:42,818
to gather a few questions. Um,
uh, VC or Jennifer. I don't

293
00:20:42,848 --> 00:20:46,179
remember how to say her last
name, but she has a list of

294
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:49,959
questions to ask during an
interview. Like to the

295
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:53,979
interviewer to try and engage
like your fit with the role in

296
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:58,628
the company. And I would like,
look, go back to that, um, to

297
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:02,138
that page and like pick out
questions for every single

298
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:05,858
interview that I had to make sure
that like, okay, this is what I

299
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:08,858
need to know about this role and
about the company to make sure

300
00:21:08,864 --> 00:21:16,058
that I'm going to fit with them.
So in order to make it a process

301
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:19,013
of like, I'm also interviewing
the interview, Like, it's not

302
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:23,034
just me. It's, it's a two way
thing that I need to also be fit

303
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:24,894
a fit and they need to be a fit
with me.

304
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:28,086
Dan: Yeah, I think that's, I
think that's really important and

305
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:30,425
it can get lost sometimes,
especially.

306
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:31,391
Sadie: Mm-hmm

307
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,641
Dan: I don't know on long
journeys on long, uh, you know,

308
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,931
struggles. Uh, but I, so I was
gonna ask them maybe think, um,

309
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:43,461
did you run into any, you know,
you said you were doing this for

310
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:46,820
so long and how many did you say
you did? How many interviews did

311
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,260
you say? I can't remember how

312
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:49,086
Sadie: at least

313
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:49,760
Dan: right?

314
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:53,405
Sadie: it was a lot of interviews
for sure. It was like 250

315
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:54,455
applications and,

316
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,691
Dan: Wow. And so like, where
were. You don't have to like call

317
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:02,990
them out or anything, but were
there any times where you were,

318
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,780
you got down the road a little
bit and were like, oh, I don't

319
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,451
know if this is actually a good
fit for me, you know, on your

320
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:08,840
side

321
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:12,622
Sadie: Right. That's a good
question. there's been a few

322
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:17,785
times, I would say. But even when
that happened, I would try to go

323
00:22:17,785 --> 00:22:21,474
into it thinking like, okay, this
is interview practice. Or like,

324
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,125
say I gotta take home or some
like technical test, I would say,

325
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:29,545
okay, this may be outta my
wheelhouse, but I may, I'm still

326
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:33,115
going to give X amount of time to
it, just to see what I can learn

327
00:22:33,115 --> 00:22:37,884
from this, like take home or from
this interview. From this

328
00:22:37,884 --> 00:22:41,464
interaction that I can then
hopefully improve the next time I

329
00:22:41,464 --> 00:22:42,105
have an interview.

330
00:22:42,746 --> 00:22:45,115
Dan: I think that's an awesome
attitude. I, you know, I've,

331
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:48,655
I've, we've had several people
suggest like taking interviews

332
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:51,776
even when you're not actively
looking, uh, for jobs, uh,

333
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:55,945
sometimes to do that practice
cuz, and it's just like, you both

334
00:22:55,945 --> 00:23:00,596
were saying it's, it's so hard
and emotionally hard and also

335
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:03,895
just like intellectually hard.
And um, I feel, I mean,

336
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:06,476
interviewing is absolutely a
skill that is separate from

337
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,391
everything else. Right. And, uh,
like any skill, I think you can

338
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:14,770
get better at it with practice.
Um, but I, I love that attitude

339
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,621
that you have. I mean, it's just
like, okay, this might not be

340
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:20,665
perfect or whatever, but I'm
still gonna go through, and build

341
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,546
up the skills or whatever. Uh,
that's awesome.

342
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:23,550
Sadie: mm-hmm

343
00:23:23,931 --> 00:23:26,810
Bekah: Yeah, it's really hard.
Even that idea of like practicing

344
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,201
an interview, you know, like
going on practice interviews, I

345
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:36,770
find to be incredibly.
Overwhelming to. I have to

346
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,701
mentally prepare myself and I'm
trying to like, make that shift

347
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,840
in mindset of, you know, what,
there aren't stakes here. I'm not

348
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,101
being judged. This is practice to
learn something and, and try and

349
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:52,010
flip it kind of like how you said
where you're interviewing the

350
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,211
company as well. Uh, because
it's, it might not be a good fit.

351
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:59,480
And I would say like, that's some
of the most advice that I give to

352
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,790
people who are interviewing for
their first job, they're like,

353
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:05,445
oh, well, what do you think about
this? Like, That's a, that's a

354
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:09,226
red flag. I wouldn't go through
that. And I think maybe as I

355
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:13,246
identify what red flags are, I
will say the more I interview,

356
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:16,875
the more I'm able to identify
what flags are, because I put

357
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:19,726
myself in situations where I'm
like, this is great. And then I'm

358
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:22,546
like, this is not great. And I
should have been able to figure

359
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:27,766
this out before I got into this
position. Um, so at least like

360
00:24:27,826 --> 00:24:31,006
keeping track of that maybe feels
like, all right, this is

361
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:36,066
progress. I'm learning something.
And. Next time. I'm never, never

362
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:41,405
gonna interview for anything ever
again. I've just, starting my own

363
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:45,276
company next because I don't
wanna have to go through that.

364
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:49,715
But if, if, if in the off chance
I do have to go through it, I, I

365
00:24:49,715 --> 00:24:53,615
really want to approach it with,
uh, I'm interviewing you first.

366
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:59,601
And, and that kind of like, um,
changes the power dynamic in the

367
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:02,810
situation. And I think kind of
alleviates some of that stress

368
00:25:02,816 --> 00:25:06,351
that you get going into those
interviews where it's like,

369
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:10,250
somebody is staring at me right
now. Well, like, Hey, I'm staring

370
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:11,381
right back at you, buddy. So,

371
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:13,550
Sadie: Right, right, exactly.

372
00:25:14,176 --> 00:25:16,817
Bekah: so how long did you prep
for your, interviews?

373
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:23,116
Sadie: Um, that's a good
question. Uh, it would depend.

374
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:27,196
Like I know when I was first
starting out my job, my job

375
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:30,406
hunting process, I would be
really diligent about. Okay. I'm

376
00:25:30,406 --> 00:25:33,826
gonna like, make sure I have my
list of questions. Ready. Make

377
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,886
sure I like review the website,
make sure I look at everybody and

378
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:41,866
all this stuff, but the more I
got like used to interviewing, I

379
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:45,047
would say the less, I actually
like sat down and prepped for the

380
00:25:45,047 --> 00:25:51,376
interviews. I don't know if I
would recommend or not, but I

381
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:55,576
don't know. I just, I guess I got
just more comfortable, like being

382
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:58,876
in that space of, okay, this is
the thing that we're doing. Like

383
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:01,666
we're both trying to gauge
whether or not we're a fit and

384
00:26:03,676 --> 00:26:07,366
we'll see what happens from
there. So if that makes sense.

385
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,791
Bekah: Yeah, no, I love that. It
shows that you're gaining

386
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:15,432
confidence as you go forward and
you've done these. So, um, you

387
00:26:15,432 --> 00:26:18,942
know, that, that's more, I think
that, you know, that's also one

388
00:26:18,942 --> 00:26:22,872
of those issues where people who
are continually interviewing are

389
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:27,281
just pushing themselves so hard
to do this prep over and over and

390
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:30,642
over. And that also kind of leads
to that situation of like you

391
00:26:30,642 --> 00:26:34,727
talked about like, Burning out in
tech, there's definitely that

392
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:39,287
burnout in the interview process.
And so sometimes you have to take

393
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:41,386
a break. And the other part of
that is like, when you're

394
00:26:41,386 --> 00:26:44,656
interviewing so much, you don't
have time to be working on

395
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:48,047
personal projects or other
things. It's like a full time

396
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:48,217
job.

397
00:26:48,616 --> 00:26:52,156
Sadie: exactly. Exactly. Yeah.
That was one of the tips that I

398
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:58,126
got, um, while job hunting and
with the career coach was that

399
00:26:58,132 --> 00:27:02,567
like, you can like stop trying to
keep up with personal projects.

400
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:07,682
Like this is what you need to be
doing. Like once you secure your

401
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:10,741
job, then you can start your
personal projects back up and be

402
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:16,711
like getting paid for it. But
yeah, like the idea was that

403
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:22,291
like, you could do both, but like
you're probably better off, not

404
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:26,281
so you can completely focus on
like your time and energy on

405
00:27:26,342 --> 00:27:28,442
interviewing. And then when
you're not interviewing, you can

406
00:27:28,622 --> 00:27:32,852
like be off and like live your
life. So, yeah.

407
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:36,671
Bekah: Yeah. I like the idea too,
of like giving yourself

408
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:40,060
permission. You can have
permission. It's okay to not be

409
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,451
working on these personal
projects. And I even think that

410
00:27:43,451 --> 00:27:46,510
it's okay to take a break from
interviewing, you know, I know

411
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:50,141
that people feel like they're
losing momentum or they're not

412
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:53,800
ever going to be able to find the
next interview if they're not

413
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,310
doing it all the time, but you
know, if you're burning yourself

414
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:01,750
out before you start, then you're
gonna start burnt out too. And

415
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,800
that's not where you wanna.

416
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,131
Sadie: very true.

417
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:12,790
Bekah: So as you were looking for
a job, uh, what was your method

418
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,330
of applying? Were you applying?
Were you reaching out to people

419
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,780
personally? What kind of was the
right direction for you?

420
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:25,675
Sadie: Oh, that's a great
question. Um, first I started off

421
00:28:25,675 --> 00:28:30,605
just applying. So I, I think I
started off using like LinkedIn

422
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:35,546
and maybe just LinkedIn at first,
but then I started getting more

423
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:39,476
plugged into like the different
job sites, like remote and like

424
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:45,086
different. Job boards cuz I knew
I wanted to be remote. Um, then

425
00:28:45,086 --> 00:28:50,816
the further along I got into my
like application groove, I

426
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:55,316
started reaching out to hiring
managers on LinkedIn and even

427
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:59,066
like other engineers that were at
companies that I saw were either

428
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:03,205
hiring or that I thought would be
interesting to work at. And from

429
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:06,371
there I would try to make a
connection and be like, Like I'm

430
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:09,490
looking for engineering roles or
I see that you have, um, like a

431
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:14,171
software engineer role open, um,
who should I talk to basically?

432
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:18,971
And so sometimes I wouldn't get a
response, which is fine, but when

433
00:29:18,971 --> 00:29:23,770
I did get a response, it would,
um, usually I would get an

434
00:29:23,776 --> 00:29:28,990
interview and like be able to put
a name to a face and like start a

435
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,086
convers. So that, that was also
another thing that I learned that

436
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:35,996
I feel like I would probably do
more of would be to actually

437
00:29:35,996 --> 00:29:39,925
reach out to people on LinkedIn
and like have a conversation as

438
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:45,536
opposed to just applying or even
not even apply. Cuz I found that

439
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:51,415
like sometimes I would play to a
job and like have the

440
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:55,405
conversation with the hiring
manager and then. They would say,

441
00:29:55,405 --> 00:29:59,306
okay, maybe you're not so much of
a fit for this role per se, but

442
00:29:59,306 --> 00:30:02,635
we have something coming down the
pipeline that you may be a better

443
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:06,506
fit for. And it just kind of
opened my eyes of like, oh, like,

444
00:30:06,536 --> 00:30:11,155
wait a minute. Like, I just need
to talk to people like this is, I

445
00:30:11,161 --> 00:30:15,566
feel like I unlocked a key, like,
I didn't know this before, but

446
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:22,046
yeah. Yeah, I would, yeah, that
was very eye opening.

447
00:30:23,414 --> 00:30:25,125
Dan: So the people you were
reaching out to

448
00:30:25,154 --> 00:30:25,375
Sadie: Mm.

449
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:29,265
Dan: wait, explain to me again,
like how you were choosing who to

450
00:30:29,265 --> 00:30:30,015
reach out to,

451
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:34,288
Sadie: So I would okay. Say I
would find a role that was

452
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:38,159
interesting. So I would then go
into LinkedIn and search the

453
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,638
company name and then like quote,
hiring or manager or director or.

454
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:47,939
Something like some higher up or
someone that's gonna be in the,

455
00:30:48,118 --> 00:30:52,229
um, like hiring panel or
something. And then I'd pick

456
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:57,778
someone whose title matched and
then reach out to them. Yeah.

457
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,288
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you'd
find a, you'd find a job opening

458
00:31:01,288 --> 00:31:03,808
on a, on a board or something
like that, and then update, you'd

459
00:31:03,814 --> 00:31:07,679
do some homework yeah, that's
really cool. I love that. Uh,

460
00:31:07,683 --> 00:31:10,138
that's a great, um, that's a
great tip. I mean, and I think

461
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:15,239
that's like a, I mean, Aside from
the sneakiness of it seems like a

462
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:18,509
really good, you know, like
connecting with people is, uh,

463
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,118
almost always a good thing, you
know what I mean? And, and like,

464
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:24,959
as long as I assume, you're, I'm
sure you are doing it sort of

465
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:27,568
respectfully and with some
knowledge, you know, uh, and not

466
00:31:27,568 --> 00:31:33,028
just blasting out the same thing
to everybody's, you know,

467
00:31:33,118 --> 00:31:36,929
whatever, uh, a million different
people. Um, yeah, that's great. I

468
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:37,558
love, I love that.

469
00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:39,179
Sadie: Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:43,169
Bekah: It, it personalizes it,
right? Because before you're a

471
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:47,489
name on a sheet of a paper or an
internet form or whatever, but

472
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:51,449
now there's more, there's a face
to it. There's a voice to who

473
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:55,199
they're looking at and then
hiring managers or whoever can

474
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:58,048
make that connection, like, oh,
okay. I know this person, you

475
00:31:58,054 --> 00:32:00,509
know, even if you haven't had an
in depth conversation, there's

476
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:04,499
something about like, oh, I do,
there is already a connection

477
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:08,618
there. Makes it you're, you're
already a half, a step above in

478
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,788
front of everybody else in that
pile and that, you know, that can

479
00:32:12,788 --> 00:32:16,808
make the difference, you know? So
is that the job that you're

480
00:32:16,814 --> 00:32:19,808
currently at, did that start with
you reaching out to somebody.

481
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:28,124
Sadie: no, it's funny. I, I saw
that job in like a. Like an email

482
00:32:28,334 --> 00:32:32,953
list. It's called words of mouth,
I believe. And they post like all

483
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:36,554
these cool jobs, but, so I saw
that one and then I was about to

484
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,874
reach out to someone when someone
in my bootcamp at school crush

485
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:43,453
was like, Hey, you should apply
to this job. Like we've been

486
00:32:43,453 --> 00:32:47,834
talking and they think that you
might be a great fit. So I was

487
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:52,124
like, okay, like, sweet. Like I
just saw this job. So yeah, like

488
00:32:52,124 --> 00:32:58,588
it was again like that community
connection of. Hey, like yeah.

489
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:01,709
The community connection. Mm-hmm

490
00:33:02,489 --> 00:33:05,459
Dan: That's cool. they had
already heard of you before you

491
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:12,148
even had nice. Isn't funny, that
the way that works out, lots of

492
00:33:12,148 --> 00:33:14,878
times where you've done so many
applications and stuff, and then

493
00:33:14,878 --> 00:33:18,269
this, this one that actually it's
like came about in some, some

494
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:20,068
strange connection in some other
way.

495
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:22,788
Sadie: exactly. Exactly.

496
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:26,023
Bekah: One of my favorite things
is when people reach out to me

497
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:27,703
and they're like, Hey, do you
know anybody that would be good

498
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:32,624
for this job? And then like, can
like, yes, I do. You know, I

499
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:35,923
think like I'm about to maybe
submit my fifth referral to

500
00:33:35,923 --> 00:33:40,615
somebody somebody at DRA. I just
like. Eventually somebody's gonna

501
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:43,163
be a good fit and I'm gonna help
them find it, you know?

502
00:33:43,598 --> 00:33:48,689
Sadie: yes. Yeah. You never know,
like, yeah. I, I can only

503
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:51,749
imagine, or like, even in being
in that position of like someone

504
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:56,864
having referred. Like the
gratitude, like is immeasurable.

505
00:33:56,864 --> 00:34:00,614
So yeah, you're doing amazing
work. Bekah.

506
00:34:01,364 --> 00:34:06,884
Bekah: Oh, thank you. I, I also
like, well, I just wanna say too,

507
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:10,034
when people reach out to me from
the community and they're like,

508
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:13,514
Hey, I wanna apply to this job.
Would you mind like sending a DM

509
00:34:13,514 --> 00:34:16,634
on my behalf? Cuz I know you're
connected with this person. And

510
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:20,173
most times I do, sometimes there
are people that I'm like, I've

511
00:34:20,173 --> 00:34:24,298
never. Been in a room with you or
had a conversation with you prior

512
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:28,378
to this point. So I don't feel
comfortable with that. But, um,

513
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:32,429
if I know somebody, if I've even,
I would say there have been

514
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,909
people that I probably haven't
been in the same breakout room

515
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:39,418
with, but would still recommend
because I see how they interact

516
00:34:39,423 --> 00:34:43,228
with other people in slack, or
I've heard them talk to other

517
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:46,739
people on a luncheon during a
luncheon learner, something like

518
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:50,398
that. And I'm like, yeah, that
person. Is awesome. Like they're

519
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:53,039
really patient or they're really
knowledgeable or they're really

520
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,548
great at teaching. And so I feel
comfortable being able to pass

521
00:34:56,548 --> 00:35:00,028
that along. And so if somebody is
looking and you do have a

522
00:35:00,028 --> 00:35:04,469
connection to a community member
that has a connection, then, then

523
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:07,739
it's okay to reach out to them
and ask them for a

524
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:12,208
recommendation. And I've even had
people in the past. When I was a

525
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:17,083
teacher say, I need a
recommendation. Do you, I wrote

526
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:21,313
it already. Would you send this?
So like, alright, I'm gonna

527
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:24,614
change it up a little bit to put
it in my voice, but I agree with

528
00:35:24,614 --> 00:35:27,673
everything you've said and it
makes it easier on me, so sure.

529
00:35:27,704 --> 00:35:28,213
You know,

530
00:35:28,623 --> 00:35:28,844
Sadie: Yes,

531
00:35:29,773 --> 00:35:31,244
Bekah: I don't think that's
cheating. I think it's just

532
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:33,673
making it a little bit easier.
And if the person feels

533
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,903
comfortable sending it than they,

534
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:38,983
Sadie: exactly. And like, you can
say what you wanna hype up about

535
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:41,414
yourself and then have someone
co-sign that. So yeah,

536
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:42,443
absolutely.

537
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:46,168
Bekah: Mm-hmm. Dan, you were
gonna say something and I

538
00:35:46,168 --> 00:35:47,009
interrupted you.

539
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:55,543
Dan: Yeah. What do you think it
was? Um, it was, oh, no, I was

540
00:35:55,543 --> 00:35:58,873
just gonna talk like harp about
how networking, you know, like

541
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:01,514
having a network of people that,
you know, and could trust is, is

542
00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:04,664
so important with all this stuff,
you know, cuz it's like that you

543
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:09,208
found that reference and I've had
people both. Knew they were

544
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,188
hiring and, and asked me, you
know, Hey, are you looking for

545
00:36:11,188 --> 00:36:13,918
like, whatever you look for a job
or the same way as Bekah like, do

546
00:36:13,918 --> 00:36:16,648
you know anybody that would fit
this role? Like we're, we're,

547
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:20,579
we're looking to hire somebody.
Um, it's the same kind of thing,

548
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,298
you know, and if I, um, I love
being able to help people, but

549
00:36:24,304 --> 00:36:27,148
also, like, I know, like I have
just having a network, you know,

550
00:36:27,148 --> 00:36:30,778
I have this like large safety net
almost, you know, of, if

551
00:36:30,778 --> 00:36:33,389
something fell, fell apart or
whatever, you know, I, I know I

552
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:37,333
have a bunch of people that I
can. Lean on for helping support

553
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:40,664
and stuff, uh, in the future. So
I dunno. It's, it's cool. It's

554
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:41,143
good stuff.

555
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:41,798
Sadie: Mm-hmm

556
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:42,103
Bekah: Yeah.

557
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:46,273
Dan: I, all of my job all sorry.
So I'm, uh, independent, but all

558
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:50,384
of my, like clients I've ever
worked for are all word of mouth,

559
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,384
you know, um, like connections of
connections, stuff like that. And

560
00:36:53,384 --> 00:36:57,014
it's always the, you know, and I,
I work, I have, I have a network

561
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:01,949
of people that do my kind of work
and, um, It's always, this it's

562
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:04,679
always the, those clients and are
always the ones that are like the

563
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:07,349
best clients. You know what I
mean? As opposed to like the cold

564
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:10,409
call ones or like where there's
no connection at all before, and

565
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:14,188
that's not to say it can never
work obviously, but, um, and

566
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:17,128
those, those like word of mouth
connections are only come from,

567
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,608
you know, building a, like I hate
using, I don't know the word

568
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:23,518
network is like, it's got like a
bunch of weird connotations, you

569
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:27,539
know? Um, cuz there's like a lot
of bad ways to. Do networking,

570
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:30,958
you know, like I've never like
actively been like, I'm gonna go

571
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:34,168
network now, you know? Uh, but
that's what you end up with, you

572
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,778
know, at different communities
and, and things that they really

573
00:37:36,778 --> 00:37:40,679
are in network. It's, it's a good
word that has been poisoned by,

574
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:45,028
uh, I don't know, connotations
other things. Yeah. I don't know.

575
00:37:45,568 --> 00:37:49,887
But, uh, anyway, that's all just
to say, um, I don't know what

576
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:53,038
it's just to say, other than the
community is important. to the

577
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,347
Virtual Coffee podcast.

578
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,038
Bekah: Well, and community is a
great way to gain experience too,

579
00:37:59,038 --> 00:38:01,677
along with connections, you know,
I know there's a bunch of people

580
00:38:01,677 --> 00:38:05,188
that put Virtual Coffee
experience on their resume. I,

581
00:38:05,193 --> 00:38:07,978
um, actually interviewed for a
job a couple of years ago. And

582
00:38:07,978 --> 00:38:10,228
while I was interviewing, they
were like, oh yeah, somebody else

583
00:38:10,228 --> 00:38:12,538
from Virtual Coffee is
interviewing too. We talked about

584
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:16,438
in the interview, I still don't
know who that person is. Um, but

585
00:38:16,438 --> 00:38:21,358
I was like, huh, that's really
interesting. I love it though.

586
00:38:21,362 --> 00:38:23,427
You know, it's great. Like
everybody is giving back to the

587
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:28,527
community in some way. And like,
if, if the, their experience

588
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:32,697
doing the support that they do at
Virtual Coffee leads to a job, I

589
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:34,588
love it. I am 100% here for that.

590
00:38:35,538 --> 00:38:35,757
Sadie: Mm.

591
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,958
Bekah: No. Okay. So you've gone
on all these interviews, you've

592
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:44,487
done all these things. And I, we,
we talked about how tough the

593
00:38:44,577 --> 00:38:48,838
interview scene is in tech, but
are there any like good interview

594
00:38:48,842 --> 00:38:51,807
stories that you have or
experiences that you're like?

595
00:38:51,813 --> 00:38:53,878
Well, I wouldn't mind having that
one again.

596
00:38:54,268 --> 00:39:00,027
Sadie: Right. Yeah. Ooh. I think
one that stood out to me was, I

597
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:03,807
think it was a two part. Like the
first interview was like me

598
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:08,487
gathering a whole bunch
questions. The space was set up

599
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:11,668
that like, this is your time to
ask us any questions that you

600
00:39:11,668 --> 00:39:16,947
have And so I was super excited
about the role on the team. So I

601
00:39:16,947 --> 00:39:22,858
had like a whole list of like 40
questions and put it it's really

602
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:26,788
embarrassing now, but I really,
I, I put it up on GitHub and

603
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:32,038
like, Created a repo of questions
and shared it with them. And

604
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:35,697
they're like, oh, this is so
cool. And like little intimidated

605
00:39:35,697 --> 00:39:40,288
now. Cause you have all these
questions prepared but it worked

606
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:44,188
out cuz I, I passed to the next
round and that next round was to

607
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:48,268
present a project that I had been
working on in kinda like talk to

608
00:39:48,268 --> 00:39:53,577
them about like the features or
like why I built it and have a

609
00:39:53,577 --> 00:39:56,608
discussion on like maybe how it
could be improved and things like

610
00:39:56,728 --> 00:40:00,972
that. So I thought, like it was
super, um, collaborative and

611
00:40:00,972 --> 00:40:06,853
like, I don't wanna say low
stakes, but it changed the ni

612
00:40:07,123 --> 00:40:10,393
dynamic, cuz it wasn't like me
getting a take home. And then I

613
00:40:10,398 --> 00:40:13,722
had to get familiar with one of
the directions that they want me

614
00:40:13,722 --> 00:40:16,813
to follow. And then also think of
like, okay, how would I do this?

615
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:21,762
And like, it's not that, but it
was a project that I had made and

616
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:27,043
like was excited about and wanted
to talk to other people about. I

617
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:30,793
had an opportunity to see how
they would collaborate with me on

618
00:40:30,793 --> 00:40:35,623
projects and like how they would
give feedback. And I don't know,

619
00:40:35,623 --> 00:40:42,822
it just felt like a, a more like
big picture view of the

620
00:40:42,822 --> 00:40:46,483
interviewer or of me. And so,
yeah, I would totally do that

621
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:48,222
again. Like if all interviews
could be like that,

622
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:53,458
Dan: That's really cool. So they
were, so it was to present some,

623
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:56,637
just any random project that you
had been working on personally.

624
00:40:56,668 --> 00:41:00,297
Yeah. That's love that idea cause
gives you, yeah, it takes all the

625
00:41:00,297 --> 00:41:03,358
pressure off of the, um, like
learning some unfamiliar thing

626
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,588
and, but you can still see having
to present it like that. Lets

627
00:41:07,588 --> 00:41:12,373
you. Sort of show off how, you
know, much, you know, or what,

628
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:14,262
like the kinds of things you
think about that your thinking

629
00:41:14,262 --> 00:41:16,422
process is, which is the kind of
stuff that you really wanna know

630
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:20,083
when you're interviewing anyway,
as like an interviewer you don't

631
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:23,563
wanna know. I mean, I've
personally like, it's like, okay,

632
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:25,902
there's like different skill
levels. People might, like,

633
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,092
nobody knows everything. People
might have holes in their

634
00:41:28,092 --> 00:41:31,932
knowledge. But the thing that
you're always looking for is, uh,

635
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:36,313
is like, uh, the ability to like
think through problems and, you

636
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:42,657
know, um, sort of. Be able to
constructively like talk about

637
00:41:42,657 --> 00:41:45,327
things, right. And if you're
talking about your own work, then

638
00:41:45,327 --> 00:41:47,188
you don't have to, you know, then
you don't have to have the whole

639
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:49,677
step of like, learning what it
was and trying to guess what they

640
00:41:49,677 --> 00:41:52,239
were thinking or all Right. You
know, you know what you were

641
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:55,947
thinking right. Or like maybe,
you know, but maybe you remember

642
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:58,588
what you were thinking, but I
like, that's a great idea. I

643
00:41:58,588 --> 00:42:02,668
like, I like that. I, uh, I don't
think I'm ever gonna hire

644
00:42:02,668 --> 00:42:05,608
anybody, but I, I always like I
love what I hear about things

645
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:08,007
like that that are like a little
bit different than everybody, you

646
00:42:08,007 --> 00:42:11,847
know, than, than the usual thing.
Um, and try to take notes of 'em,

647
00:42:11,847 --> 00:42:17,789
but, um, yeah, that's nice.
That's a cool one. Okay. So you

648
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:20,730
said I'm gonna jump all the way
to the now times you said you

649
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:24,449
work for a federal agency and you
do front end development. That I

650
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:27,599
think that's really interesting.
So are there, um, I guess my

651
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,909
question is like, can you, are
you able to talk a little bit

652
00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:33,329
about what that's like, like
working in a government agency,

653
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:36,644
especially doing front end stuff?
I mean, I. That makes me think of

654
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:39,135
like, uh, rules and, you know,
oh, you have to like a bunch of

655
00:42:39,135 --> 00:42:40,815
regulations you have to follow or
something like that. And maybe

656
00:42:40,815 --> 00:42:44,894
that's not the case, but like I,
or yeah, or Bekah is gonna gonna

657
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,014
call DARPA and, you know, get the
aliens coming. Uh, but I just

658
00:42:48,014 --> 00:42:49,105
like, would like to hear about
it. I'm just curious.

659
00:42:49,514 --> 00:42:53,505
Sadie: Yeah. That's that's yeah.
Yeah. Um, so I just started in

660
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:57,255
April, so I'm still trying to
wrap up, like, what can I do and

661
00:42:57,255 --> 00:43:03,251
what can I do? But from my
understanding that all federal

662
00:43:03,251 --> 00:43:06,641
websites need to follow a set of
standards called the us web

663
00:43:06,641 --> 00:43:13,152
design standard. And. something
that's created by, I believe by

664
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:23,081
18F they are like another, like,
um, kind of like agency, not like

665
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:28,632
agency, like big agency, but like
they create the standards for

666
00:43:28,722 --> 00:43:32,411
websites across federal agencies
if I understand correctly. But

667
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:36,777
anyways, the us web design. It's
kind of like, um, kind of like

668
00:43:36,777 --> 00:43:40,737
bootstrap where you put your
classes into the HTML to make

669
00:43:40,737 --> 00:43:44,606
sure that the website is
accessible. So like button sizes

670
00:43:44,606 --> 00:43:48,266
and like screen sizes and media
queries and things like that are

671
00:43:48,266 --> 00:43:51,626
all sort of set by these
standards and you just kind of

672
00:43:51,626 --> 00:43:57,117
drop it into the HTML. Um, yeah,
I'm still trying to learn that,

673
00:43:57,476 --> 00:44:04,827
but yeah, outside of that, like,
I, I. played too much outside of

674
00:44:04,827 --> 00:44:08,697
that. And like tried to really
customize the website per se,

675
00:44:08,757 --> 00:44:15,117
because I inherited this, um,
this website and the properties

676
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:20,336
for the, for the agency. And so I
don't have the really built out

677
00:44:20,336 --> 00:44:25,481
too much, like by hand. which is,
um, good and bad

678
00:44:26,952 --> 00:44:28,632
Dan: Well, I mean like over time
you'll yeah.

679
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:33,132
Sadie: yeah, yeah, yeah. It'll
take some time, but yeah, that,

680
00:44:33,132 --> 00:44:36,371
that's what I'm finding most
interesting. Um, it seems like,

681
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:41,532
uh, Jekyll is very favored and
also, uh, all of, not all, but a

682
00:44:41,532 --> 00:44:46,271
lot of the websites are on
GitHub, so you can actually see

683
00:44:46,302 --> 00:44:50,021
like how these sites are built.
And if you want to like poke

684
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,056
around, like it's all. Yeah.

685
00:44:53,487 --> 00:44:54,327
Dan: Nice. That's cool.

686
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:57,416
Sadie: Yeah, yeah, yeah,

687
00:44:57,657 --> 00:44:58,137
Dan: Um,

688
00:44:58,211 --> 00:45:00,371
Bekah: using a lot of Jekyll. Is
that what you said?

689
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:02,126
Sadie: yeah. It's Jekyll yeah.

690
00:45:02,552 --> 00:45:02,972
Bekah: That's

691
00:45:03,936 --> 00:45:04,226
Sadie: yeah.

692
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:10,481
Bekah: Both of my blogs are using
Jekyll because I'm not really

693
00:45:10,481 --> 00:45:13,871
even sure that's the direction I
went when I first started. And so

694
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:18,382
I just kept going with it I feel
like Jekyll this is Jekyll

695
00:45:18,402 --> 00:45:21,581
tangent. I love using Jekyll, but
I feel like their documentation

696
00:45:21,581 --> 00:45:25,711
is terrible. And I keep hearing
people that love Jekyll they're

697
00:45:25,711 --> 00:45:28,211
like, but their community is
great. So you can ask lots of

698
00:45:28,211 --> 00:45:32,512
questions and they'll get. But I,
I just want to read it in the

699
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:37,581
documentation, just explain this
to me, but also I've never like

700
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:40,942
contributed to their
documentation. So that's also

701
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:44,092
something I should probably do
instead of complaining about

702
00:45:45,146 --> 00:45:48,567
Sadie: I hear that. Yeah. I feel
that.

703
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:49,481
Dan: complain once in a while.

704
00:45:51,442 --> 00:45:53,032
Bekah: I'm done my rant. Sorry.

705
00:45:54,472 --> 00:45:56,512
Dan: Oh man. I, I just, that's
very interesting. I mean, I've

706
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:59,362
done, I've concentrated on the
front end for, you know, my whole

707
00:45:59,367 --> 00:46:03,411
career. And so, but I've never
worked with anything, you know,

708
00:46:03,442 --> 00:46:07,652
that have any external standards
that anybody's looking at in any

709
00:46:07,652 --> 00:46:10,702
of the code. You know what I
mean? Yeah. We try to like be as

710
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:13,251
like accessible as possible and
you know, all that stuff, but

711
00:46:13,251 --> 00:46:18,291
it's always just me. That's doing
those and enforcing it on myself

712
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:20,362
or whatever, you know, or, or any
teammates that I'm working with,

713
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:23,271
but it it's never coming down
from above, you know what I mean?

714
00:46:23,391 --> 00:46:26,092
Um, and so that's, that's like
gotta be in a really interesting

715
00:46:26,092 --> 00:46:31,791
experience, uh, to be in that
role. Um, you know, and that's

716
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:34,161
awesome that they're, uh, that
they are doing to open source

717
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:35,902
stuff. That's really cool. Um,

718
00:46:36,262 --> 00:46:40,222
Sadie: Yeah. There's a lot of
open source of projects from the

719
00:46:40,222 --> 00:46:40,672
government.

720
00:46:41,512 --> 00:46:44,092
Dan: That's awesome. Yeah, that,
that makes me like wonder. Yeah,

721
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:47,452
just now you know, I always just
assume that it's all like locked

722
00:46:47,452 --> 00:46:52,342
down and it's all, uh, whatever,
super custom, you know, DARPA,

723
00:46:52,431 --> 00:46:56,422
DARPA static sites. Uh, but no,
they're just open source season

724
00:46:57,262 --> 00:46:57,442
That's

725
00:46:57,672 --> 00:46:58,161
Sadie: exactly.

726
00:46:58,311 --> 00:47:03,302
Dan: So, yeah, that's cool. Thank
you for sharing about that, that

727
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,681
I find that really interest.

728
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:07,936
Bekah: What do you like best
about your job?

729
00:47:08,822 --> 00:47:12,632
Sadie: Oh, that's a good
question. I don't know. I feel

730
00:47:12,632 --> 00:47:16,981
like I'm gonna get kind of meta,
but that I am at a federal

731
00:47:17,192 --> 00:47:21,271
agency. um, it feels like it
completes like a cycle or

732
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:26,371
something because my grandmother
and my grandfather were both in

733
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:32,731
the army and my uncles were. In
like the army and Marines. My mom

734
00:47:32,731 --> 00:47:36,931
retired military, like retired
air force. And so I grew up in

735
00:47:36,931 --> 00:47:41,822
the military family and always
like, had that like, Ooh, am I

736
00:47:41,827 --> 00:47:45,902
gonna join the military or not?
Or am I gonna be like, a

737
00:47:45,902 --> 00:47:48,961
contractor or something? And I
always felt like, nah, that's not

738
00:47:48,961 --> 00:47:52,501
for me. Nah, that's not, that's
not what I'm gonna do. And I'm

739
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:58,771
here. Like I'm a contractor now.
So it's just like, oh wow. Like

740
00:47:59,282 --> 00:48:01,592
familiar cycles are, are a thing.

741
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:05,806
Bekah: That's such a great story.
that.

742
00:48:06,871 --> 00:48:12,811
Sadie: yeah. Yeah. It's so funny.
Yeah. Like, um, yeah. My mom

743
00:48:12,811 --> 00:48:20,282
retired like two months out from
my 18th. So like, it's like the

744
00:48:20,282 --> 00:48:24,871
military and like that connection
is just like a part of my

745
00:48:24,876 --> 00:48:27,842
identity. And like, I feel like
that's something that, like, not

746
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:32,251
too many people know, it's like,
I like I'm, I'm like looking

747
00:48:32,251 --> 00:48:34,561
around right now. You can't see
this, but like where I am right

748
00:48:34,561 --> 00:48:39,001
now, I grew up actually on the
military base. Like that's

749
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:42,751
probably like five miles away
from my house. And I don't know,

750
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:46,771
it was just a lot of like, wow,
like, Like, I've always been

751
00:48:46,771 --> 00:48:51,931
aware of contractors and like,
just that relationship, but just

752
00:48:52,442 --> 00:48:55,831
now being on the other side and
saying like, oh, like, huh, this

753
00:48:55,831 --> 00:48:58,981
is how, this is how it works. And
like, I can also see like how

754
00:48:58,981 --> 00:49:02,791
intense it is to be in the
military and like the, the sort

755
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:08,192
of like expectations you have to
fulfill that role. Like, like I

756
00:49:08,192 --> 00:49:12,181
came into. this job thinking
like, oh, like now I can't like,

757
00:49:13,382 --> 00:49:18,092
be late for my job. Or I can't
like take, take off work because

758
00:49:18,092 --> 00:49:25,081
that's what I saw my mom, like
having to like, um, I guess

759
00:49:25,081 --> 00:49:29,192
fulfill or like be secure in her
job, but that's, it's not like

760
00:49:29,192 --> 00:49:33,601
that at all. Like, I, I have a
wonderful team that like respects

761
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:37,561
work life balance and. people
have kids and like, they

762
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:40,862
understand like, you know,
today's not the day, like just

763
00:49:40,862 --> 00:49:45,302
come back tomorrow and it'll be
okay. Like that sort of thing. So

764
00:49:45,306 --> 00:49:51,152
yeah, it it's a, it's really
deep, but yeah, that's my answer.

765
00:49:53,266 --> 00:49:55,577
Bekah: I like that. I mean,
there's, there's familiarity

766
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:58,786
there. Right. And then there's
comfort that comes with that. And

767
00:49:59,086 --> 00:50:02,936
when you're talking about taking
on a new job, it's really nice to

768
00:50:02,936 --> 00:50:05,686
be able to have something like
that, where you can feel

769
00:50:05,686 --> 00:50:07,547
comfortable in some aspect of
what you're doing.

770
00:50:08,251 --> 00:50:11,311
Sadie: Right. Exactly. Exactly.

771
00:50:14,086 --> 00:50:18,047
Bekah: Well, we're at just about
time here is, is there any last

772
00:50:18,047 --> 00:50:22,217
piece of advice you have for our
listeners who are prepping for

773
00:50:22,277 --> 00:50:26,117
interviews or leaving boot camps
and about to discover the next

774
00:50:26,117 --> 00:50:27,047
stage of their journey? Uh,

775
00:50:27,467 --> 00:50:33,646
Sadie: Oh, that's uh, okay. I
could say so much, but I hate to

776
00:50:33,646 --> 00:50:37,157
say like something trite, but
like also like one trusted

777
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:42,436
process and then two, you know,
more than you think. Like, for

778
00:50:42,436 --> 00:50:45,677
example, I didn't know Jack at
all, when I was interviewing for

779
00:50:45,677 --> 00:50:50,911
this job. One, I reached out to
my community. So if you need a

780
00:50:50,911 --> 00:50:55,442
community, find your community,
VC's here, but there's also

781
00:50:55,442 --> 00:51:00,121
others. And then two, like do
what you can explain what you,

782
00:51:00,302 --> 00:51:03,121
what you did and like your
thought processes. And if it's

783
00:51:03,121 --> 00:51:06,302
not the fit, it's not a fit, but
you will find your job and you

784
00:51:06,302 --> 00:51:06,661
can do it.

785
00:51:07,021 --> 00:51:08,552
Dan: All of that. Trust the
process.

786
00:51:09,012 --> 00:51:09,431
Sadie: Mm-hmm

787
00:51:10,262 --> 00:51:12,552
Bekah: Yeah, I love that. Thanks
