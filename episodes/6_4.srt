00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:08,016
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 6, Episode 4

2
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:09,516
of

3
00:00:09,516 --> 00:00:12,365
the Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

4
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:15,214
that

5
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:18,693
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

6
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:20,043
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

7
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:21,393
their

8
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:24,094
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

9
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:26,700
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,814
it with you. Here with me today
is my cohost, Dan.

11
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:35,914
Dan Ott: Wuddup, Bek? [Bekah and
Dan laugh] Ho-how's it going?

12
00:00:36,844 --> 00:00:38,433
Bekah: It- it's going
wonderfully [laughs].

13
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:45,694
Dan: Excellent. Today we are
talking with Sadie Jay, who is a

14
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:48,993
front-end developer with a
federal agency. We talked about

15
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:51,653
her long experience doing the
interview process, and, yeah.

16
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:54,313
And

17
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:56,834
her experience working at a- at
a government agency as well.

18
00:00:56,954 --> 00:01:00,179
Bekah: Yeah, it was really
interesting to hear how she kind

19
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:02,353
of started in tech. She burnt
out, and left tech for a while,

20
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,527
and

21
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:08,278
then decided to give it a second
shot, and she's back doing it

22
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:11,308
again. And it sounds like she's
really excited. But also like,

23
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:14,444
took those lessons that she
learned from that burnout

24
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:18,284
experience and brought them with
her so she doesn't get burnout

25
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:21,000
again. And I think that's
really, really useful because I

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,513
see that happen to a lot of
people.

27
00:01:23,364 --> 00:01:25,700
Dan: Yeah, totally. I -- it was-
it was interesting hearing her

28
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,864
talk about her thought process,
you know, when she was

29
00:01:29,864 --> 00:01:34,903
experiencing the burnout stuff
and- a-and just taking a break

30
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:38,114
like that, you know, and- and
dealing with it head on. I

31
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:39,700
think it was- it was really
cool. And I think there's a lot

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,084
of valuable stuff in there.

33
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:44,914
Bekah: Yep. And we start every
episode of the podcast like we

34
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:48,243
start every Virtual Coffee. We
introduce ourselves with our

35
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:51,993
name, where we're from, what we
do, and a random check-in

36
00:01:52,054 --> 00:02:03,500
question. And we hope you enjoy
this episode. Hi, I'm Bekah. I

37
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,254
am a technical community builder
from a small town in Ohio. And

38
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:10,299
an

39
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,166
imaginary class that I wish was
offered. I feel like this is

40
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,028
hard

41
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:21,748
because I'm not sure what would
be practical for an imaginary

42
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:25,483
class [chuckles]. And, maybe,
imaginary classes aren't

43
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:29,218
practical?

44
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:31,800
Dan: Did the imaginary class
teach imaginary things? Or is

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,193
this like a chance to learn, you
know?

46
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:35,100
Bekah: Oh, for sure. It can
teach-

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,500
Dan: Magic or whatever? Mm.

48
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,299
Bekah: -imaginary things. Yeah.
I think I

49
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:47,618
would like to definitely take a
class that watches people

50
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:54,633
have brain scans. And that's not
an imaginary class. I'm kind of

51
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,378
like neurobiology class. But
there's [laughs] gotta be some

52
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:00,123
kind of

53
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:06,041
imaginary aspect to brain scans
and ... people. I'm really bad

54
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:11,508
at this

55
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:13,503
question [Dan laughs]. I was the
one that chose it too. So I'd

56
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:15,498
just, like,

57
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:19,218
makes it worse. I'm just gonna
like look at people's

58
00:03:19,218 --> 00:03:24,408
brains and see what they do.
That's it. It's not imaginary.

59
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:26,658
It's wishful. That's what I
wish.

60
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:27,000
Dan: Is this what --

61
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,248
Bekah: I wish to watch people's
brains.

62
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:31,739
Dan: Less of a class and more of
a profession you wish you had?

63
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:35,108
Bekah: [Laughs] Yes, I would
love to be a neurobiologist.

64
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:37,218
That would be

65
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:40,038
fantastic. What? Okay. Maybe an
imaginary class on, like,

66
00:03:40,038 --> 00:03:41,988
studying

67
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,408
black holes by, like, actually
physically exploring them. Cuz

68
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:46,800
that's not possible.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,200
Dan: Mm.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,568
Bekah: So, is that better?

71
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:52,734
Dan: I don't know [laughs]. I
don't know what to do with this

72
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:54,079
question.

73
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:59,239
Hi, I'm Dan. I do computer
development things in

74
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:03,378
Cleveland. And, yeah. Imaginary
class. I have no -- I

75
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:05,823
mean, I don't really understand
this question [all laugh] to

76
00:04:05,823 --> 00:04:08,268
tell you the truth.

77
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:14,239
I- I don't know. I guess I'm
gonna go with ... like,

78
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,700
spaceship flying? Yeah. But,
like, not the boring ones that

79
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,319
we have in the reality though,
you know? Or like "Star Wars".

80
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:22,038
Bekah: "Star Wars" spaceship
flying?

81
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:23,538
Dan: Like -- yeah, yeah. Like
teach me how to fly the-

82
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:24,918
Bekah: That's a good imaginary
class.

83
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:26,569
Dan: -the Millennium Falcon or
something, you know? That'd be

84
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:26,778
cool.

85
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,218
Bekah: Yeah, that's what I
thought. Yeah.

86
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:29,703
Dan: As long as I actually got
to fly it. Yeah. Yeah. All

87
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,728
right. That's gonna be my answer
[laughs].

88
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:38,014
Sadie Jay: Okay. Hi, I'm Sadie.
I'm from a small town in the

89
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:40,264
Panhandle, Florida. I am a
front-end developer for a

90
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:42,514
federal

91
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:49,774
agency. And ... an- an imaginary
class. I think I would take -- I

92
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:52,863
don't know. I -- this makes me
think of like when I was in

93
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,053
elementary school and like,
super obsessed with, like, ESP

94
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:57,243
and like,

95
00:04:57,274 --> 00:05:01,744
being psychic and things like
that. So I would probably pick

96
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:02,703
some class that develops, like,
your psychic abilities. I don't

97
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:03,662
know [laughs]. Yeah.

98
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:06,319
Bekah: I think-

99
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:06,619
Dan: I like that.

100
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:09,798
Bekah: -that is a good -- an
excellent answer. You have

101
00:05:09,803 --> 00:05:13,769
definitely won this round of
intro questions [laughs].

102
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:16,000
Sadie: [Laughs] Thank you.

103
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:19,428
Dan: Yeah. My first answer was
gonna be like, learn, you know,

104
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:20,569
learn the Force, you know?

105
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:21,163
Sadie: Ooh.

106
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:23,000
Bekah: Mm. That's a good one.

107
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:24,319
Dan: Then I was thinking about
spaceships would be fun too, so

108
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:27,300
-- and a little more practical.
I was worried that -- I think

109
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,500
that, canonically-

110
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:28,700
Bekah: How will you --

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,778
Dan: -you have to, like, have
the -- be able to use

112
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:33,789
the Force to learn -- like in
the net -- it's not like

113
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:35,119
everybody can learn it,

114
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:37,500
you know? It would be a bummer
to sign up for that class, and

115
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,000
make it there, and then you find
out you-

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Sadie: Can't work it. You aren't
eligible [laughs].

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,033
Dan: -can't- can't -- right.
Like [laughs] --

118
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:45,064
Bekah: You can watch everybody
else use the Force, but you're

119
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:45,334
stuck.

120
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:46,000
Dan: Right. Right, right.

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Sadie: You miss the
[unintelligible] [laughs].

122
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,468
Dan: It's not like everybody can
use a --

123
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:51,108
everybody could use a- a -- or
learn how to fly spaceships.

124
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:52,894
Bekah: I feel like I wanna class
on communicating with

125
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,139
aliens, but

126
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:55,894
I feel like DARPA already has
that or something like -- it's

127
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:57,649
out

128
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,215
there. We just don't know about
it yet [laughs]. Well, welcome

129
00:06:00,215 --> 00:06:02,781
Sadie.

130
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:06,122
Thanks for being here with us
today. We're very, very excited

131
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:10,041
to have you. And we always like
to start off with your tech

132
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:11,917
origin stories. So how did you
get to this point in your tech

133
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:13,762
journey?

134
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:18,501
Sadie: Ooh, wow. Yeah. That's
... a good question. I- I feel

135
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:21,515
like it

136
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:25,956
was a winding journey, for sure.
Like, I- I didn't really grow

137
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:32,137
up with a desire to be in tech.
Like, my household computer

138
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,406
was just the computer that let
me get on cartoonnetwork.com and

139
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:38,604
play games [laughs]. Like, it
wasn't much past that. But I

140
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:41,797
would say,

141
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:48,276
right after I graduated with my
bachelor's degree in

142
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:53,932
psychology, I got into drawing
and painting. Like -- and this

143
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:55,522
was just like a random desire
that I had. I was like, "Ah, I

144
00:06:55,522 --> 00:06:57,112
just wanna

145
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:59,751
learn painting. I'm just gonna
take a class." So I did it

146
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:02,390
[chuckles]. And, like,

147
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:04,854
fell in love. And from that, I
wanted to, like, find a career

148
00:07:04,854 --> 00:07:07,312
that

149
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:11,700
let me combine psychology and,
like, drawing or visual arts. So

150
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,046
I was like, "Okay, maybe web
design, somehow? Cuz that would

151
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:19,700
also let me work remotely and
give me some flexibility." So,

152
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,191
I went to a bootcamp.

153
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:25,927
I went to Skillcrush and signed
up for one of their

154
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:27,441
courses. It was like a web
design course or visual design

155
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:28,955
course.

156
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:32,601
This was back in like 2017 ...
like, several years ago. But I

157
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:36,186
wanted

158
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:37,432
to, like, test out the waters to
see if that was something I

159
00:07:37,432 --> 00:07:38,677
would

160
00:07:38,682 --> 00:07:41,409
be interested in. And, like, it-
it seemed good enough. Like, I-

161
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:44,136
I

162
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:47,317
felt like I could do it. So then
I signed up for my master -- my

163
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:52,101
master's, specializing in web
design and online communication.

164
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:57,081
And in that program, like, we
did both web design and also web

165
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:01,072
development. And I realized that
like, actually web development

166
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:03,983
was more my thing and not so
much the web design. So, yeah.

167
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,890
So,

168
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:11,122
that was like the really -- the
kickoff to my tech journey, for

169
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:13,236
sure. But after I graduated, I
-- there was another pivot.

170
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:15,350
Like, I

171
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:19,700
was completely burnt out on tech
and anything tech related. Like,

172
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,641
I couldn't bear to think about,
like, coding. And I remember,

173
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:24,965
like, I

174
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:29,257
applied to some internship and
got a LeetCode challenge, but at

175
00:08:29,257 --> 00:08:32,736
the time I didn't know what that
was. So I was like, "Oh, wow. I

176
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:34,089
just graduated with this
degree," and like, "I can't even

177
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,437
use it."

178
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:37,956
Like, I don't know what [laughs]
-- like, how to do this thing

179
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:40,206
with JavaScript

180
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:42,156
that they want me to do. So it
just completely, like,

181
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:44,106
demoralized

182
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:48,621
me and, like, crushed my
confidence. So I became a yoga

183
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:50,661
teacher. I was out in Brooklyn
and doing that, like, yoga life

184
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:52,701
and-

185
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:53,152
Bekah: Awesome.

186
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:56,500
Sadie: -like [chuckles] meeting
with cool people. And then I

187
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,231
got into the travel

188
00:08:57,231 --> 00:08:59,961
industry and did that for a
year. But all of that ended

189
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:02,691
around 2020

190
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:04,942
when I left the job, and then
the pandemic started, and all

191
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:07,192
that. So

192
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:10,139
it gave me time to reflect. And
I had to move back home after

193
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:13,086
being

194
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,267
in Brooklyn for a few years. And
I really thought, I was like,

195
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:18,381
"Okay, what am I gonna do next?"
Cuz, like, I don't want to be

196
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:20,495
here,

197
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,736
like Florida, which is home for
me. Like, I don't wanna be here

198
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:25,509
forever, but I do wanna take the
time to, like, make sure that,

199
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:27,277
like,

200
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:33,547
I'm going in a direction that I
feel good about and kind of came

201
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:37,117
to the conclusion that, like, I
didn't really give tech a try.

202
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:40,687
Like, I-

203
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:45,547
I let the burnout, like, kinda
like, take over. I don't know. I

204
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:48,982
guess, like, my direction or
just like ... I dunno, just had

205
00:09:48,982 --> 00:09:52,417
me stopping

206
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,996
my tracks. So I was like, "You
know what? I'm gonna give this a

207
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:59,647
college try," like, "Imma- imma
do this again. And this

208
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:03,547
time, I'm going to make sure I
have community around me." And

209
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:05,729
that's how I found y'all, I
found Virtual Coffee. So I

210
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:07,911
restarted my

211
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:11,631
bootcamp, restarted Skillcrush,
and did the front-end developer

212
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:15,892
intensive. But this time, I was
very intentional about joining

213
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:17,767
community, like, being very
active in Virtual Coffee, and I

214
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,642
wanted

215
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:23,991
to do the open source thing. So,
it would just so happen that

216
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:28,096
the kickoff for the
Hacktoberfest month was like a

217
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:31,971
week or two

218
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:34,807
away. So that's when I joined
Virtual Coffee, and I got to sit

219
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:38,000
in, and watched Dan do the --
like, how to contribute to open

220
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
source. And, yeah. So it- it all
just went from there.

221
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,000
Dan: Awesome.

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,376
Sadie: [Chuckles] Yeah, so I
ended

223
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:46,011
up like contributing to, like,
five projects, and like, I

224
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:47,646
contributed

225
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,976
to a couple of IBM projects. I
got to do a demo day with them.

226
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:58,537
And then, started the job search
or -- in, like, February? And

227
00:10:58,956 --> 00:11:02,000
that was another beast of its
own where it took like nine

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,797
weeks and just hundreds of
applications to get this job

229
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:10,927
that I have now. Yeah. That's
how I got here. Yeah [laughs].

230
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,000
Dan: I mean, that --

231
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:17,692
Bekah: That's awesome. I love
that story. I -- there's just --

232
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:24,000
I like that you have gone
through a lot of different,

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
like, different journeys on this
journey here, right?

234
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,312
Sadie: Absolutely.

235
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,857
Bekah: You've done a lot of
different things, but also,

236
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,402
like, coming back from

237
00:11:31,402 --> 00:11:35,932
burnout. I imagine that's gotta
be kind of a hard decision to

238
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:41,782
make. What really kind of pushed
you in that directions? Like,

239
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:44,331
"Okay, fine. I'm gonna do this
one more time."

240
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:47,691
Sadie: Right. That's- that's a
good question. I think, one,

241
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:49,791
time.

242
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:52,806
Time helped. Cuz I had graduated
2018 and then I felt like I

243
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:55,700
could

244
00:11:55,701 --> 00:12:00,000
entertain the thought of tech
again, like, what? A few years

245
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,532
later? So,

246
00:12:00,532 --> 00:12:03,472
2021? So, really, it was just
time and space that helped, I

247
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,412
would

248
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:11,721
say for the most part. But also,
I don't know. I know, like, I

249
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:16,042
wanted flexibility in my job and
like, where I worked. Like, that

250
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:17,977
was also the catalyst of going
into the master's degree

251
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:19,912
program.

252
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:22,056
So, like, I think that thread
just continued. And I was like,

253
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:24,200
"Okay, I

254
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:28,672
think I could do tech again."
Because I've tried, like, I also

255
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:31,942
tried writing on the side a
little bit, but that didn't feel

256
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:38,841
quite as a fit. So I think just
... I dunno. The reflection and

257
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:43,522
wanting to like challenge myself
and see something to completion

258
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:44,392
also helped.

259
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:48,703
Dan: Can you talk a little bit
about your experience?

260
00:12:48,823 --> 00:12:52,000
So, if I have this right, you
did a -- the bootcamp, and then

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,500
you went to a master's program
after that?

262
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:54,800
Sadie: Mm-hmm. I did, yeah.

263
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,803
Dan: So, that's like a lot of
school, like, [laughs]

264
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:57,500
in a -- all together.

265
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:57,800
Sadie: Yeah [laughs].

266
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,000
Dan: Can you talk a little -- I-
I don't think I've actually --

267
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,923
we've talked to anybody who is
learn web design stuff or web

268
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:07,524
development stuff in a master's
program. Could you -- would you

269
00:13:07,524 --> 00:13:09,300
mind sharing a little bit about
what that was like?

270
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Sadie: Sure. Yeah.

271
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,033
Dan: And- and,

272
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,283
especially, like, compared to --
since you did it right after the

273
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:16,823
bootcamp, maybe- maybe compared
to what- what it was like-

274
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:17,004
Sadie: Right.

275
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,192
Dan: -yep. Yeah. The different
approaches and everything.

276
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:23,700
Sadie: Yeah. So, okay. So I did
the bootcamp. And I- I don't

277
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,313
even can know if I completed the
course, like, before I did the

278
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:31,464
master's. Like, it was just
enough to be like, "Okay, this

279
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:35,994
seems like something I could
do." So I went into my master's

280
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:40,673
program without any knowledge of
code or anything. But that was

281
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:44,604
the -- like the setup for the
degree. Like, you didn't have to

282
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:50,364
have any prior knowledge. But, I
don't know. I don't -- I kind of

283
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:53,611
don't know how to, like, give
more details, cuz it was -- it-

284
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:56,858
it -- like

285
00:13:56,859 --> 00:14:03,188
college. Like you -- like, we
had four classes a semester —

286
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:05,033
that's what I signed up for.
And, like, the very first class

287
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:06,878
was

288
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:09,971
like a web design principles,
and like, it went into HTML, and

289
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:13,058
maybe

290
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:15,639
a little bit of CSS, and I don't
even think we touched JavaScript

291
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,000
that much in that first class.
And then it built up from there.

292
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,308
We learned like -- it was mostly
DOM manipulation. Cuz it- it

293
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:23,063
wasn't

294
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,118
like a computer science class,
so we didn't learn, like,

295
00:14:25,118 --> 00:14:27,173
algorithms

296
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:30,293
or data structures or anything
like that. But basically, like,

297
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:33,295
how to create websites, and,
like, webpages with an eye for

298
00:14:33,295 --> 00:14:36,292
design.

299
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:44,514
We also learn like Adobe Suite,
and social media, and

300
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:48,000
like, analytics for websites,
and things like that. Like, the

301
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,448
capstone project was to create a
WordPress site for a local

302
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:56,078
company. And our

303
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,733
cohort was divided up into
teams. And that was like -- that

304
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:01,388
was

305
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:06,519
the peak, like, the end of the
program. But I say all that to

306
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,500
say, like -- so, I did that,
finished in 2018, and then went

307
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:19,719
back into the bootcamp 2021. And
I- I feel like I retained enough

308
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:23,408
information, but it was enough
to know that like, "Oh, yeah. I

309
00:15:23,408 --> 00:15:26,723
remember learning that in
school." So I felt like what I

310
00:15:26,723 --> 00:15:30,038
learned in

311
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:31,688
the bootcamp and what I learned
in school were comparable, but

312
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:33,338
it

313
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,438
was just that I had more time in
school to learn the things and

314
00:15:35,438 --> 00:15:37,537
to

315
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:42,300
like, kinda like, dive into each
thing that was taught, like,

316
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,346
each aspect of HTML or CSS or
JavaScript. Whereas the bootcamp

317
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:47,963
was like,

318
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:52,163
basically, the same topics but
just in a more condensed

319
00:15:52,224 --> 00:15:57,894
time space, even though it was
self-paced. So, yeah. It was

320
00:15:57,894 --> 00:15:58,524
really interesting.

321
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,683
Dan: Yeah, I guess it makes
sense.

322
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:05,500
Bekah: So, the -- so, after you
did the master's program-

323
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,000
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Bekah: -then you went into the
bootcamp-

325
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,300
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

326
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,198
Bekah: -was there any interview
prep that you did

327
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,088
as part of the master's program
or was that -- did you do that

328
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:14,918
in the [laughs] -- you face it.
[Laughs] No.

329
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:19,824
Sadie: [Laughs] Yeah, no. For
the master's program absolutely

330
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:23,649
not.

331
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:27,759
And I feel like that's why,
like, I was so blindsided by the

332
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:35,048
LeetCode challenge. But, yeah.
What -- the- the, like, real

333
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:40,239
world aspect of the bootcamp --
oh, not the bootcamp. Of the

334
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:43,568
master's degree was like an
internship. So I did an

335
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:48,698
internship at American Document
POV, a media company.

336
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:51,383
And I'm- I'm smiling because
like, I don't -- y'all can't see

337
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:53,588
me,

338
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:55,739
but I'm smiling. And [laughs]
and I'm laughing because, like,

339
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:57,889
it was an

340
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:01,700
internship in the digital team,
but it didn't have anything to

341
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,108
do with, like, the website or
anything. So I had to, like,

342
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,773
shoehorn, like, "Hey, I- I need
to do something with WordPress.

343
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:08,438
I need

344
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:10,390
to do something [laughs]." But
what it ended up being was more

345
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,337
like me

346
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:14,483
working with the producers and
doing, like, other cool stuff.

347
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:16,628
But,

348
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:17,963
yeah. No. That was the extent
of, like, the real world

349
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:19,298
application

350
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:23,798
for the master's program. So I
was like completely lost when I

351
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:27,578
was job hunting and ... yeah
[laughs].

352
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,993
Bekah: I think most people are
completely lost when they're job

353
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:34,114
hun- hunting, you know? It's
just like, there's not a lot of

354
00:17:34,114 --> 00:17:37,804
preparation and job interviews
are all over the place. So you

355
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:41,943
just never know what to expect.
And like, having to prepare so

356
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:46,263
much for each one of them makes
it really, really hard. Did you

357
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:48,453
do interview prep with
Skillcrush?

358
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:50,964
Sadie: I did. Yeah. So, the
front-end developer intensive

359
00:17:50,964 --> 00:17:53,019
includes

360
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:56,243
a job hunting coach — like a
career coach — that helps you,

361
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:59,408
like,

362
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:02,333
with prepare your resume, and
like, prepare your cover letter,

363
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,088
and get

364
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:09,068
your, like, one minute, like ...
what's it called? Like, a one

365
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:12,488
minute, like, spiel about
yourself and ... I dunno. Just

366
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:13,000
interview practice and-

367
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,000
Bekah: Elevator pitch.

368
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,608
Sadie: -how to answer questions.
Exactly. Elevator

369
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:19,989
pitch. Yeah, so Skillcrush had
that. And that really opened my

370
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:23,063
eyes to, like, how to be
strategic when job hunting. And

371
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:26,137
like -- kinda

372
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:28,898
like understand what to expect
when interviewing in the tech

373
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:31,403
field. And, yeah. Without that,
I- I really don't think I

374
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,908
would've --

375
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:38,798
or it- it either would have
taken me a lot longer to find my

376
00:18:38,804 --> 00:18:43,500
job or I would have stopped
again. And probably would've

377
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,048
said maybe tech just not for me.

378
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:49,304
Bekah: Yeah. And that's so
unfortunate that there are so

379
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:51,419
many people trying to break into
tech and are just quitting

380
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,534
before

381
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,439
they get there, because the
inter- and the interview process

382
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:57,344
is not

383
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,693
reflective of most of the stuff
that you're going to be doing.

384
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:04,298
Sadie: Mm-mm. Mm-mm. And like,
without that knowledge of like,

385
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:05,752
"Oh, like, I

386
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:08,153
actually don't maybe need to
know how to, like, do this

387
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:10,553
LeetCode-y

388
00:19:10,554 --> 00:19:13,434
thing," like, if you don't have
that understanding, then like --

389
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:16,314
I feel

390
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:17,724
like that's what feels like the-
the tutorial loop were like,

391
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,134
"Oh,

392
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:21,249
I need to know how to do this
weird niche thing." Or like,

393
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:23,364
"Maybe

394
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:27,144
I actually don't know enough, so
I need to keep going." Like ...

395
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:30,000
I don't know. It -- the
interview process is so, like,

396
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,034
demoralizing. Or it can be.

397
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:34,599
Bekah: That's a really good word
for -- I even think, like, some

398
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,814
of

399
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:40,703
the best interview processes are
still very exhausting and tough

400
00:19:40,703 --> 00:19:46,000
to get through. So, why don't
you -- can you walk us through

401
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,534
what it was like to prepare for
an interview?

402
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:52,118
Sadie: Ooh, that's a good
question [chuckles]. I -- hmm.

403
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:54,908
That's a good

404
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:57,166
question. I feel like what I did
would be to, like, look at the

405
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,423
job

406
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:00,818
website, and like, look at the
people that I'm interviewing

407
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:02,213
with,

408
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:03,564
and like, kinda stalk their
Instagram -- oh, not Instagram

409
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:04,824
[laughs].

410
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:09,743
Their LinkedIn. I dunno why I
said Instagram. But, yeah.

411
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:11,396
Stalk their LinkedIn a little
bit and try to find, like, some

412
00:20:11,396 --> 00:20:13,043
sort of

413
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:18,173
commonality that I may have with
them and have the idea to bring

414
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:23,003
it up. Even though, like, I'm
really shy and I probably won't

415
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:24,693
ever bring up like, "Hey, I
looked at your LinkedIn." And I

416
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:26,377
noticed,

417
00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:28,058
like, I'm not that kind of
person. But just having that,

418
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:29,738
like,

419
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:33,128
background behind that person
that I'm gonna be interviewing

420
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:38,318
help me feel a little more
confident. I would also try

421
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:42,818
to gather a few questions. VCer,
Jennifer, I don't

422
00:20:42,848 --> 00:20:46,179
remember how to say her last
name. But she has a list of

423
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:49,959
questions to ask during an
interview. Like, to the

424
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:53,979
interviewer, to try and gauge,
like, your fit with the role in

425
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:58,628
the company. And I would like,
look -- go back to that- to

426
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:02,138
that page, and like, pick out
questions for every single

427
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:03,998
interview that I had to make
sure that like, "Okay, this is

428
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:05,858
what I

429
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:08,858
need to know about this role and
about the company to make sure

430
00:21:08,864 --> 00:21:12,461
that I'm going to fit with
them." So in order to make it a-

431
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:16,058
a- a process

432
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:19,013
of, like, I'm also interviewing
the interviewer. Like, it's not

433
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:23,034
just me. It's- it's a two way
thing that I need to also be fit

434
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:24,894
-- a fit, and they need to be a
fit with me.

435
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:27,500
Dan: Yeah, I think that's- I
think that's really important.

436
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,425
And it can get lost sometimes,
especially-

437
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:31,391
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

438
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,350
Dan: -I don't know. On long
journeys [laughs], on long, you

439
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,640
know,

440
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,845
struggles. But I -- so I- I was
gonna ask them -- it made me

441
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:38,930
think,

442
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:43,461
did you run into any, you know,
you said you were doing this for

443
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:44,000
so long and-

444
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,300
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

445
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,820
Dan: -how many did you say you
did? How many interviews did

446
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,260
you say? I- I can't remember how
many, but like a lot-

447
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:49,086
Sadie: That was at least --

448
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:49,760
Dan: -right?

449
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:51,300
Sadie: It was a lot of
interviews, for sure.

450
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:51,500
Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

451
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,455
Sadie: It was like 250
applications and ... yeah.

452
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,700
Dan: Yeah. Wow. A-and so, like,
were- were there -- I mean,

453
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,691
you don't have to, like, call

454
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:01,340
them out or anything [chuckles],
but were there any times where

455
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,989
you were --

456
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,780
you got down the road a little
bit and were like, "Oh, I don't

457
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,451
know if this is actually a good
fit for me," you know, on your

458
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:08,840
side?

459
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:12,622
Sadie: Right. That's a good
question. There's been a few

460
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:15,205
times, I would say. But even
when that happened, I would try

461
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:17,784
to go

462
00:22:17,785 --> 00:22:19,629
into it thinking like, "Okay,
this is interview practice." Or

463
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,473
like,

464
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,700
say, I got a take-home or some,
like, technical test, I would

465
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,835
say, "Okay, this may be outta my
wheelhouse, but I may -- I'm

466
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:29,545
still

467
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:33,115
gonna give X amount of time to
it, just to see what I can learn

468
00:22:33,115 --> 00:22:37,884
from this." Like takeaway or
from this interview or from this

469
00:22:37,884 --> 00:22:39,674
interaction that I can then
hopefully improve the next time

470
00:22:39,674 --> 00:22:42,105
I have an interview.

471
00:22:42,746 --> 00:22:43,930
Dan: Hm. I think that's an
awesome attitude. I, you know,

472
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,114
I've-

473
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:48,655
I've -- we've had several people
suggest, like, taking interviews

474
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:51,776
even when you're not actively
looking for jobs [laughs].

475
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:53,875
Sometimes to do that practice
cuz -- and it's just like you

476
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,944
both

477
00:22:55,945 --> 00:23:00,000
were saying, it's- it's so hard
and -- emotionally hard, and

478
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,895
also just, like, intellectually
hard. And I- I feel -- I mean,

479
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:06,476
interviewing is absolutely a
skill that is separate from

480
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,700
everything else, right?

481
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,000
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

482
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,391
Dan: And ... like any skill, I
think you can

483
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:14,770
get better at it with practice.
But I- I love that attitude

484
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,621
that you have. I mean, it's just
like, "Okay, this might not be

485
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:20,300
perfect or whatever, but I'm
still gonna go through, and

486
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,700
build up the skills or whatever
[laughs]."

487
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,300
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

488
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:22,546
Dan: That's awesome.

489
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:23,550
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

490
00:23:23,931 --> 00:23:25,370
Bekah: Yeah, it's really hard.
Even that idea of, like,

491
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,809
practicing

492
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,201
an interview -- you know, like
going on practice interviews, I

493
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:36,770
find to be incredibly
overwhelming to -- I have to

494
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,701
mentally prepare myself and I'm
trying to, like, make that shift

495
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,785
in mindset of, you know, "What
-- there aren't stakes here. I'm

496
00:23:42,785 --> 00:23:44,840
not

497
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,970
being judged. This is practice
to learn something." And- and

498
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,100
try and

499
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:50,555
flip it, kind of like how you
said, 'Where you're interviewing

500
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,009
the

501
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,211
company as well.' Because it's
-- it might not be a good fit.

502
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:57,845
And I would say, like, that's
some of the most advice that I

503
00:23:57,845 --> 00:23:59,479
give to

504
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,790
people who are interviewing for
their first job. They're like,

505
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:03,828
"Oh, well, what do you think
about this?" Like, that's a-

506
00:24:03,828 --> 00:24:05,445
that's a

507
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:09,226
red flag. I wouldn't go through
that. And I think maybe as I

508
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:13,246
identify what red flags are -- I
will say the more I interview,

509
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:16,875
the more I'm able to identify
what flags are. Because I put

510
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:18,303
myself in situations where I'm
like, "This is great." And then

511
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:19,725
I'm

512
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:22,546
like, "This is not great." And I
should have been able to figure

513
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,000
this out before I got into this
position.

514
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,300
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

515
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,766
Bekah: So, at least, like,

516
00:24:27,826 --> 00:24:31,006
keeping track of that maybe
feels like, "All right, this is

517
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:33,536
progress. I'm learning
something. And now -- next

518
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,066
time, I'm never, never

519
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:38,000
gonna interview for anything
ever again." I've just [laughs]

520
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,405
-- want starting my

521
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:45,276
own company next because I don't
wanna have to go through that.

522
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:49,715
But if- if- if in the off chance
I do have to go through it, I- I

523
00:24:49,715 --> 00:24:51,665
really want to approach it with
the, 'I'm interviewing you

524
00:24:51,665 --> 00:24:53,615
first.'

525
00:24:53,615 --> 00:24:54,111
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

526
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:56,856
Bekah: And- and that kind of
like changes the power dynamic

527
00:24:56,856 --> 00:24:59,601
in the

528
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:02,810
situation. And I think kind of
alleviates some of that stress

529
00:25:02,816 --> 00:25:06,351
that you get going into those
interviews where it's like

530
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:09,500
somebody is staring at me right
now. Well, like, "Hey, I'm

531
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,381
staring right back at you,
buddy." So --

532
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:13,550
Sadie: Right, right. Exactly.

533
00:25:14,176 --> 00:25:16,817
Bekah: So, how long did you prep
for your interviews?

534
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:23,116
Sadie: That's a good question.
It would depend.

535
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:27,196
Like, I know when I was first
starting out my job- my job

536
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:28,816
hunting process, I would be
really diligent about, "Okay.

537
00:25:28,816 --> 00:25:30,405
I'm

538
00:25:30,406 --> 00:25:33,826
gonna, like, make sure I have my
list of questions ready, make

539
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,359
sure I, like, review the
website, make sure I look at

540
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,886
everybody, and

541
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:41,000
all this stuff." But the more I
got, like, used to interviewing,

542
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,456
I would say the- the less I
actually, like, sat down and

543
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:45,046
prepped for the

544
00:25:45,047 --> 00:25:48,211
interviews which I don't know if
I would recommend or not, but

545
00:25:48,211 --> 00:25:51,375
... I

546
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:53,476
don't know. I just -- I guess, I
got just more comfortable, like,

547
00:25:53,476 --> 00:25:55,576
being

548
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:58,500
in that space of, "Okay, this is
the thing that we're doing.

549
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,666
Like, we're both trying to gauge
whether or not we're a fit, and

550
00:26:03,676 --> 00:26:05,521
we'll see what happens from
there." So -- if that makes

551
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:07,366
sense [chuckles].

552
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,791
Bekah: Yeah. No, I love that. It
shows that you're gaining

553
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:14,000
confidence as you go forward and
you've done these practices. So,

554
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,187
you know, that- that's more -- I
think that, you know, that's

555
00:26:17,187 --> 00:26:18,942
also one

556
00:26:18,942 --> 00:26:22,872
of those issues where people who
are continually interviewing are

557
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:27,000
just pushing themselves so hard
to do this prep over and over

558
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,961
and over. And that also kind of
leads to that situation of,

559
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:30,641
like, you

560
00:26:30,642 --> 00:26:34,727
talked about, like, burning out
in tech. There's definitely that

561
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:37,007
burnout in the interview
process. And so sometimes you

562
00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:39,287
have to take

563
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:41,386
a break. And the- the other part
of that is, like, when you're

564
00:26:41,386 --> 00:26:44,656
interviewing so much, you don't
have time to be working on,

565
00:26:44,656 --> 00:26:48,047
like, personal projects or other
things. It's like a full time

566
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:48,217
job.

567
00:26:48,616 --> 00:26:50,386
Sadie: [Laughs] Exactly.
Exactly. Yeah. That was one of

568
00:26:50,386 --> 00:26:52,156
the tips that I

569
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:58,126
got while job hunting and with
the career coach, was that

570
00:26:58,132 --> 00:27:00,349
like, you can, like, stop trying
to keep up with personal

571
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:02,566
projects.

572
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:05,154
Like, this is what you need to
be doing. And, like, once you

573
00:27:05,154 --> 00:27:07,682
secure your

574
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:09,211
job, then you can start your
personal projects back up and

575
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,740
be,

576
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:16,711
like, getting paid for it. But,
yeah. Like, the idea was that

577
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:19,501
like, you could do both, but
like, you probably better off

578
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:22,291
not,

579
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:26,281
so you can completely focus on
-- like, your time and energy on

580
00:27:26,342 --> 00:27:27,700
interviewing. And then when
you're not interviewing, you

581
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,852
can, like, be off and like, live
your life. So, yeah. You know?

582
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:36,671
Bekah: Yeah. I like the idea
too, of like giving yourself

583
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:40,060
permission. You can have
permission. It's okay to not be

584
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,451
working on these personal
projects. And I even think that

585
00:27:43,451 --> 00:27:46,510
it's okay to take a break from
interviewing, you know? I know

586
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:50,141
that people feel like they're
losing momentum or they're not

587
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:51,970
ever going to be able to find
the next interview if they're

588
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,799
not

589
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,310
doing it all the time. But, you
know, if you're burning yourself

590
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,530
out before you start, then
you're gonna start burnt out

591
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,750
too. And

592
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,800
that's not where you wanna be.

593
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,131
Sadie: Mm. Mm. Very true.

594
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:12,790
Bekah: So, as you were looking
for a job, what was your method

595
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,330
of applying? Were you applying?
Were you reaching out to people

596
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,780
personally? What kind of was the
right direction for you?

597
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:25,675
Sadie: Ooh, that's a great
question. First, I started off

598
00:28:25,675 --> 00:28:30,605
just applying. So, I- I think, I
started off using like LinkedIn

599
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:33,115
and ... maybe just LinkedIn at
first. But then I started

600
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:35,545
getting more

601
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:38,500
plugged into, like, the
different job sites, like remote

602
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,476
and -- like

603
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:42,281
different remote job boards cuz
I knew I wanted to be remote.

604
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:45,086
Then

605
00:28:45,086 --> 00:28:50,816
the further along I got into my,
like, application groove, I

606
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:55,316
started reaching out to hiring
managers on LinkedIn, and even,

607
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,191
like, other engineers that were
at companies that I saw were

608
00:28:57,191 --> 00:28:59,066
either

609
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:02,700
hiring or that I thought would
be interesting to work at. And

610
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,788
from there, I would try to make
a connection and be like, "Hey,"

611
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:06,371
like,

612
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:07,930
"I'm looking for engineering
roles," or, "I see that you

613
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,489
have, like, a

614
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:14,171
software engineer role open. Who
should I talk to, basically?"

615
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:16,826
And so, sometimes I wouldn't get
a response, which is fine. But

616
00:29:16,826 --> 00:29:18,971
when

617
00:29:18,971 --> 00:29:23,770
I did get a response, it would
-- usually I would get an

618
00:29:23,776 --> 00:29:26,383
interview and like, be able to
put a name to a face and, like,

619
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:28,990
start a

620
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,038
conversation. So that- that was
also another thing that I

621
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:33,086
learned that

622
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:35,996
I feel like I would probably do
more of, would be to actually

623
00:29:35,996 --> 00:29:39,000
reach out to people on LinkedIn
and like, have a conversation,

624
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,730
as opposed to just applying or
even not even apply. Cuz I found

625
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,535
that,

626
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:51,415
like ... sometimes I would apply
to a job and like, have the

627
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,410
conversation with the hiring
manager, and then they would

628
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,405
say,

629
00:29:55,405 --> 00:29:57,355
"Okay, maybe you're not so much
of a fit for this role per se,

630
00:29:57,355 --> 00:29:59,305
but

631
00:29:59,306 --> 00:30:00,970
we have something coming down
the pipeline that you may be a

632
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,634
better

633
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:06,000
fit for." And it just kind of
opened my eyes of like, "Oh,"

634
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,118
like, "Wait a minute." Like, "I
just need to talk to people

635
00:30:08,118 --> 00:30:09,700
[laughs]."

636
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,161
Like, this is -- I

637
00:30:11,161 --> 00:30:13,363
feel like I unlocked the key.
Like, I didn't know this before.

638
00:30:13,363 --> 00:30:15,565
But,

639
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:22,046
yeah. Yeah. I would -- yeah.
That was ... very eye opening.

640
00:30:23,414 --> 00:30:25,125
Dan: So, the people you were
reaching out to-

641
00:30:25,154 --> 00:30:25,375
Sadie: Mm.

642
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:28,700
Dan: -wait. Explain to me again.
Like, how you were choosing who

643
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,015
to reach out to?

644
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:34,288
Sadie: So, I would -- okay. Say,
I would find a role that was

645
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:38,159
interesting. So I would then go
into LinkedIn, and search the

646
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,398
company name, and then, like,
quote hiring or manager or

647
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:44,637
director or

648
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:46,483
something -- like, some higher
up or someone that's gonna be in

649
00:30:46,483 --> 00:30:47,938
the,

650
00:30:48,118 --> 00:30:52,800
like, hiring panel or something.
And then I'd pick someone-

651
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

652
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,778
Sadie: -whose title matched, and
then reach out to them. Yeah.

653
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,288
Dan: Yeah, yeah. Okay. So you'd
find a- you'd find a job opening

654
00:31:01,288 --> 00:31:02,808
on a- on a board or something
like that. And then-

655
00:31:02,808 --> 00:31:03,000
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

656
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,814
Dan: -and then you'd

657
00:31:03,814 --> 00:31:04,500
do some homework and --

658
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,000
Sadie: Mm-hmm [laughs].

659
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,679
Dan: Yeah, that's really cool. I
love that.

660
00:31:07,683 --> 00:31:08,910
I like -- that's a great- that's
a great tip. I mean -- and I

661
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,137
think

662
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:12,069
that's like a -- I mean, aside
from the sneakiness of it

663
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:14,000
[laughs]-

664
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:14,500
Sadie: Yeah [laughs].

665
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,239
Dan: -it seems like a

666
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:16,874
really good, you know, a- a --
like, connecting with people is

667
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,509
--

668
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,118
almost always a good thing, you
know what I mean? And- and like,

669
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:24,700
as long as, I assume, you're --
I'm sure you are doing it sort

670
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,568
of respectfully and with some
knowledge, you know? And not

671
00:31:27,568 --> 00:31:33,028
just blasting out the same thing
to everybody used -- you know,

672
00:31:33,118 --> 00:31:33,500
whatever-

673
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:33,700
Sadie: Yeah, yeah.

674
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,929
Dan: -a million different
people. Yeah, that's great. I

675
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:37,558
love- I love that idea.

676
00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:39,179
Sadie: Yeah. Yeah.

677
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:41,959
Bekah: It- it- it personalizes
it, right? Because before,

678
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,169
you're a

679
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:47,489
name on a sheet of a paper or an
internet form or whatever. But

680
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,469
now, there's more. There's a
face to it, there's a voice to

681
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:51,449
who

682
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:55,199
they're looking at. And then,
hiring managers or whoever can

683
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:58,048
make that connection, like, "Oh,
okay. I know this person," you

684
00:31:58,054 --> 00:32:00,509
know? Even if you haven't had an
in depth conversation, there's

685
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:02,504
something about like, oh, I- I
do -- there is already a

686
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,499
connection

687
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:06,558
there that makes it -- you're-
you're already a half, a step

688
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,617
above -- in

689
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,700
front of everybody else in that
pile. And that, you know, that

690
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,300
can make the difference, you
know?

691
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:14,500
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

692
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,808
Bekah: So, is that the job that
you're

693
00:32:16,814 --> 00:32:18,311
currently at? Did that start
with you reaching out to

694
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,808
somebody?

695
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:27,500
Sadie: No. It's funny. I- I saw
that job in like a- like a

696
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,643
email list. It's called Words of
Mouth, I believe? And they post

697
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:32,952
like all

698
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:34,753
these cool jobs. But -- so, I
saw that one. And then I was

699
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:36,553
about to

700
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,714
reach out to someone when
someone in my bootcamp at

701
00:32:38,714 --> 00:32:40,874
Skillcrush

702
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:43,453
was like, "Hey, you should apply
to this job. Like, we've been

703
00:32:43,453 --> 00:32:47,834
talking, and they think that you
might be a great fit." So I was

704
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,979
like, "Okay," like, "Sweet,"
like, "I just saw this job." So,

705
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:52,124
yeah. Like,

706
00:32:52,124 --> 00:32:55,356
it was, again, like that
community connection of like,

707
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:58,588
"Hey --," like,

708
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:01,709
yeah. The community connection.

709
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Dan: That's really cool.

710
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,489
Bekah: That --

711
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,300
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

712
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,200
Dan: So they had already heard
of you before you even-

713
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,459
Sadie: Yeah.

714
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:07,000
Dan: -chat? [Chuckles] Nice.

715
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Sadie: [Laughs] Yeah. Yeah.

716
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,924
Dan: [Laughs] Isn't it funny
that, the way that that works

717
00:33:10,924 --> 00:33:12,148
out, lots of

718
00:33:12,148 --> 00:33:14,878
times, where you've done so many
applications and stuff, and then

719
00:33:14,878 --> 00:33:15,700
this- this one that actually
works?

720
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,200
Sadie: Right. [Laughs] Right.

721
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,269
Dan: Like, came about in some s-
some

722
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:20,068
strange connection in some other
way?

723
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Sadie: Yes [laughs].

724
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:20,800
Dan: Yeah.

725
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:21,500
Sadie: Exactly.

726
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,500
Dan: That's awesome.

727
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:22,788
Sadie: Exactly.

728
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:26,023
Bekah: One of my favorite things
is when people reach out to me

729
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:27,703
and they're like, "Hey, do you
know anybody that would be good

730
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:29,601
for this job?" And then like, "I
can -- like, yes, I do," you

731
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:31,499
know?

732
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,200
Sadie: Yes. Yes [laughs].

733
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,211
Bekah: I think, like, I'm about
to maybe submit my fifth

734
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:35,922
referral to

735
00:33:35,923 --> 00:33:39,000
somebody -- for somebody at
Deepgram. I just like --

736
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,300
[chuckles] eventually,
somebody's gonna be a good fit-

737
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:41,700
Sadie: Yes.

738
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,163
Bekah: -and I'm gonna help them
find it, you know [laughs]?

739
00:33:43,598 --> 00:33:48,689
Sadie: Yeah. Yeah. You can never
know. Like, yeah. I- I can only

740
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:50,219
imagine, or like, even in being
in that position of, like,

741
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:51,749
someone

742
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:54,308
having referred me. Like, the
gratitude, like, is

743
00:33:54,308 --> 00:33:56,863
immeasurable.

744
00:33:56,864 --> 00:34:00,614
So, yeah. You're doing amazing
work, Bekah.

745
00:34:01,364 --> 00:34:04,500
Bekah: Oh, thank you. I- I also
like-

746
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,000
Dan: Just to say -- oh, go
ahead.

747
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,884
Bekah: -well, I just wanna say,
too,

748
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:10,034
when people reach out to me from
the community, and they're like,

749
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:11,774
"Hey, I wanna apply to this job.
Would you mind, like, sending a

750
00:34:11,774 --> 00:34:13,514
DM

751
00:34:13,514 --> 00:34:16,634
on my behalf? Cuz I know you're
connected with this person."

752
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:16,724
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

753
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:19,700
Bekah: And most times I do.
Sometimes there are people that

754
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,173
I'm like, "I've

755
00:34:20,173 --> 00:34:22,235
never been in a room with you or
had a conversation with you

756
00:34:22,235 --> 00:34:24,297
prior

757
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:28,378
to this point. So I just don't
feel comfortable with that. But,

758
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:30,419
if I know somebody, if I've --,"
even it -- I would say, there

759
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:32,429
have been

760
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,909
people that I probably haven't
been in the same breakout room

761
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,663
with, but I ha -- would still
recommend because I see how they

762
00:34:37,663 --> 00:34:39,417
interact

763
00:34:39,423 --> 00:34:43,228
with other people in Slack or
I've heard them talk to other

764
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:46,300
people on a lunch and -- during
a Lunch and Learn or something

765
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,568
like that. And I'm like, "Yeah,
that person is awesome." Like,

766
00:34:48,568 --> 00:34:50,397
they're

767
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:51,718
really patient, or they're
really knowledgeable, or they're

768
00:34:51,718 --> 00:34:53,038
really

769
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,548
great at teaching. And so I feel
comfortable being able to pass

770
00:34:56,548 --> 00:35:00,028
that along. And so, if somebody
is looking and you do have a

771
00:35:00,028 --> 00:35:04,000
connection to a community member
that has a connection, then-

772
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,739
then it's okay to reach out to
them and ask them for a

773
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:11,700
recommendation. And I've even
had people in the past, when I

774
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,700
was a teacher, say, "I need a
recommendation. Do you -- I

775
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,198
wrote it already. Would you send
this?" [Laughs] I'm like, "All

776
00:35:19,198 --> 00:35:21,313
right. I'm gonna

777
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:24,614
change it up a little bit to put
it in my voice, but I agree with

778
00:35:24,614 --> 00:35:25,500
everything you've said-

779
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:25,700
Sadie: Yes.

780
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,213
Bekah: -and it makes it easier
on me. So, sure," you know?

781
00:35:28,623 --> 00:35:28,844
Sadie: Yes.

782
00:35:29,773 --> 00:35:31,244
Bekah: I don't think that's
cheating. I think it's just

783
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:33,673
making it a little bit easier.
And if the person feels

784
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,903
comfortable sending it, than
they will.

785
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:38,500
Sadie: Exactly. And like, you
can say what you wanna hype up

786
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,414
about yourself and then have
someone co-sign that. So, yeah.

787
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:41,773
Bekah: Yes.

788
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:42,443
Sadie: Absolutely. Mm-hmm.

789
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:46,168
Bekah: Dan, you were gonna say
something and I

790
00:35:46,168 --> 00:35:47,009
interrupted you.

791
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:52,000
Dan: Mm, yeah. What do you think
it was? [Bekah and Sadie laugh]

792
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,543
It was ... oh, no. I was just

793
00:35:55,543 --> 00:35:57,208
gonna talk, like, hype [??]
about -- how networking -- you

794
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:58,873
know, like,

795
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:01,514
having a network of people that
you know and could trust is- is

796
00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:03,091
so important with all this
stuff, you know? Cuz it's like

797
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:04,664
that you-

798
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:06,936
you found that reference. And
I've had people both knew they

799
00:36:06,936 --> 00:36:09,208
were

800
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,198
hiring and- and asked me, you
know? "Hey, are you looking for

801
00:36:10,198 --> 00:36:11,188
--

802
00:36:11,188 --> 00:36:12,553
like, whatever you look for a
job," or the same way as Bekah,

803
00:36:12,553 --> 00:36:13,918
like, "Do

804
00:36:13,918 --> 00:36:16,648
you know anybody that would fit
this role?" Like, "We're been --

805
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:18,000
we're- we're looking to hire
somebody."

806
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,300
Sadie: Mm.

807
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,579
Dan: It's the same kind of
thing,

808
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,298
you know? And i-if I ... I love
being able to help people, but I

809
00:36:24,304 --> 00:36:25,726
also, like, I know, like I have
-- just having a network, you

810
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:27,148
know?

811
00:36:27,148 --> 00:36:28,824
I have this, like, large safety
net [chuckles], almost, you

812
00:36:28,824 --> 00:36:30,500
know, of-

813
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:30,778
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

814
00:36:30,778 --> 00:36:32,083
Dan: -if something fell- fell
apart or whatever, you know? I-

815
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:33,388
I know I

816
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:35,361
have a bunch of people that I
can, like, lean on for help, and

817
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:37,333
support,

818
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:40,664
and stuff, in the future. So --
I dunno. It's- it's cool. It's

819
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:41,143
good stuff.

820
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:41,798
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

821
00:36:41,798 --> 00:36:41,798
Bekah: Yeah.

822
00:36:41,798 --> 00:36:44,035
Dan: I -- all of my job, all --
[chuckles] sorry. So, I'm

823
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,272
independent.

824
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:49,300
But all of my, like, clients
I've ever worked for are all

825
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,000
word of mouth, you know?

826
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,200
Sadie: Wow.

827
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,292
Dan: Like, connections of
connections, stuff like that.

828
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,384
And

829
00:36:53,384 --> 00:36:55,199
it's always the -- you know, and
I- I work -- I have- I- I have a

830
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:57,014
network

831
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,481
of people that do my kind of
work and ... it's always this --

832
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:01,948
it's

833
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:04,500
always the -- those clients and
-- are always the ones that are,

834
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,500
like, the best clients, you know
what I mean?

835
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:05,700
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

836
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,349
Dan: As opposed to, like, the
cold

837
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:10,409
call ones or like where there's
no connection at all before. And

838
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:14,188
that's not to say it can never
work, obviously. But -- a-a-and

839
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:15,658
those- those, like, word of
mouth connections are only come

840
00:37:15,658 --> 00:37:17,128
from,

841
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:19,033
you know, building a, like ... I
hate using [laughs], I don't

842
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:20,608
know. The word

843
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:23,000
network is like -- it's got like
a bunch of weird connotations,

844
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,539
you know? Cuz there's like a lot
of bad ways to do networking,

845
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,700
you know? [Sadie laughs] Like,
I've never like actively been

846
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,958
like, "I'm gonna go

847
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:34,168
network now," you know? But
that's what you end up with, you

848
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,473
know, at different communities
and- and things that -- they

849
00:37:35,473 --> 00:37:36,778
really

850
00:37:36,778 --> 00:37:40,300
are a network. It's- it's a good
word that has been poisoned

851
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,200
by ... I don't know.
Connotations-

852
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,500
Bekah: [Laughs] Bad people.

853
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,028
Dan: -of other- other things.
Yeah. I dunno.

854
00:37:45,568 --> 00:37:49,887
But, anyway, that's all. Just to
say ... I don't know what

855
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:52,700
is to say other than the
community is important [laughs].

856
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,347
Welcome to Virtual Coffee
Community Podcast [laughs].

857
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,700
Bekah: Well, and community is a
great way to gain experience

858
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,300
too, along with connections, you
know? I know there's a bunch of

859
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,188
people that put Virtual Coffee
experience on their resume. I

860
00:38:05,193 --> 00:38:07,978
actually interviewed for a job a
couple of years ago. And

861
00:38:07,978 --> 00:38:09,800
while I was interviewing, they
were like, "Oh, yeah. Somebody

862
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,383
else from Virtual Coffee is
interviewing too. We talked

863
00:38:11,383 --> 00:38:12,538
about

864
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:13,800
it in the interview." And I'm
like [Sadie and Dan laugh] -- I

865
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,438
still don't know who that person
is. But

866
00:38:16,438 --> 00:38:21,358
I'm like, "Huh, that's really
interesting." I love it though,

867
00:38:21,362 --> 00:38:23,427
you know? It's great. Like,
everybody is giving back to the

868
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:28,527
community in some way. And like,
if- if the -- their experience

869
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:31,800
doing the support that they do
at Virtual Coffee leads to a

870
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,588
job, I love it. I am 100% here
for that.

871
00:38:35,538 --> 00:38:37,648
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

872
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,958
Bekah: Now, okay. So you've gone
on all these interviews, you've

873
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:44,000
done all these things. And I --
we- we talked about how tough

874
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
the interview scene is in tech.
But are there any, like, good

875
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,807
interview stories that you have
or experiences that you're like,

876
00:38:51,813 --> 00:38:53,878
"Well, I wouldn't mind having
that one again."

877
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:57,147
Sadie: Right. Yeah. Ooh. I
think, one that stood out to me

878
00:38:57,147 --> 00:39:00,026
was -- I

879
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:03,807
think it was a two part. Like,
the first interview was, like,

880
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:06,147
me gathering a whole bunch
questions. And the space was set

881
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:08,487
up

882
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:11,668
that, like, "This is your time
to ask us any questions that you

883
00:39:11,668 --> 00:39:15,700
have." And so I was super
excited [chuckles] about the

884
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,947
role on the team. So I

885
00:39:16,947 --> 00:39:22,500
had, like, a whole list of like
40 questions and put it [laughs]

886
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:22,858
-- it's really

887
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:26,788
embarrassing now. But I really
-- I- I put it up on GitHub and,

888
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:29,458
like, created a repo of
questions and shared it with

889
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:32,038
them. And

890
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:33,867
they're like, "Oh, this is so
cool. And, like, a little

891
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:35,696
intimidated

892
00:39:35,697 --> 00:39:38,000
now cuz you have all these
questions prepared." [Laughs]

893
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,288
They were like -- but it worked

894
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:44,188
out cuz I- I passed to the next
round. And that next round was

895
00:39:44,188 --> 00:39:46,512
to present a project that I had
been working on in -- kinda like

896
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:48,267
talk to

897
00:39:48,268 --> 00:39:50,922
them about, like, the features
or like, why I built it, and

898
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,576
have a

899
00:39:53,577 --> 00:39:56,500
discussion on like maybe how it
could be improved, and things

900
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,972
like that. So I thought, like,
it was super collaborative and

901
00:40:00,972 --> 00:40:06,853
like ... I don't wanna say low
stakes, but it changed the ni-

902
00:40:07,123 --> 00:40:10,393
dynamic. Cuz it wasn't like me
getting a take-home, and then I

903
00:40:10,398 --> 00:40:13,722
had to get familiar with one of
the directions that they want me

904
00:40:13,722 --> 00:40:15,267
to follow, and then also think
of like, "Okay, how would I do

905
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:16,812
this?"

906
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:20,700
And like -- it like -- it's not
that. But it was a project that

907
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,762
I had made, and

908
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:24,418
like, was excited about, and
wanted to talk to other people

909
00:40:24,418 --> 00:40:27,043
about. And I

910
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:30,000
had an opportunity to see how
they would collaborate with me

911
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,208
on projects, and like, how they
would give feedback. And -- I

912
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:35,623
don't know.

913
00:40:35,623 --> 00:40:42,822
It just felt like a- a more ...
like big picture view of the

914
00:40:42,822 --> 00:40:44,652
interviewer or- or of me. And
so, yeah, I would totally do

915
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,482
that

916
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:48,222
again. Like, if all interviews
could be like that [laughs].

917
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:51,672
Dan: That's really cool. So,
they were -- so it was to

918
00:40:51,672 --> 00:40:53,457
present some --

919
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,500
just any random project that you
had been working on-

920
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:55,700
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

921
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,637
Dan: -personally? Yeah, yeah.

922
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:56,800
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

923
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,000
Dan: That's awesome. I love that
idea.

924
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,500
Sadie: Yeah. Me too.

925
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,297
Dan: Cuz it gives you -- yeah.
It takes all the

926
00:41:00,297 --> 00:41:03,358
pressure off of the, like,
learning some unfamiliar thing

927
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,588
and -- but you can still see --
having to present it like that

928
00:41:07,588 --> 00:41:11,500
lets you sort of show off how,
you know [chuckles], much you

929
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,373
know, or what,

930
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:14,262
like, the kinds of things you
think about that, your thinking

931
00:41:14,262 --> 00:41:16,422
process is, which is the kind of
stuff that you really wanna know

932
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:17,000
when you're interviewing.

933
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,300
Sadie: Exactly.

934
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,083
Dan: Anyway, as like an
interviewer, you don't

935
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,823
wanna know -- I mean, I've
personally like -- it's like,

936
00:41:21,823 --> 00:41:23,563
okay.

937
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:25,902
There's like different skill
levels. People might -- like,

938
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,092
nobody knows everything. People
might have holes in their

939
00:41:28,092 --> 00:41:31,932
knowledge. But the thing that
you're always looking for is-

940
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:36,313
is like, the ability to, like,
think through problems and, you

941
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:42,657
know, sort of be able to
constructively, like, talk about

942
00:41:42,657 --> 00:41:44,000
things, right? [Dan and Sadie
laugh] And- and if you're

943
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,327
talking about your own work,
then

944
00:41:45,327 --> 00:41:47,188
you don't have to -- you know,
then you don't have the whole

945
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:49,500
step of like, learning what it
was and trying to guess what

946
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,000
they were thinking or all of
that-

947
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,300
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

948
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,239
Dan: -stuff, right? You know-
you know what you were

949
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:53,300
thinking [laughs], right?

950
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:53,500
Sadie: Exactly.

951
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,947
Dan: Or like, maybe you know,
but maybe you remember

952
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:57,000
what you were thinking, but --

953
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:57,500
Sadie: Exactly.

954
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,588
Dan: I like -- that's a great
idea. I

955
00:41:58,588 --> 00:42:02,668
like- I like that. I- I don't
think I'm ever gonna hire

956
00:42:02,668 --> 00:42:05,608
anybody, but I- I always like --
I love when I hear about things

957
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:06,807
like that. That are like a
little bit different than

958
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:08,006
everybody, you

959
00:42:08,007 --> 00:42:11,847
know, than- than the usual
thing. And I take notes of 'em,

960
00:42:11,847 --> 00:42:17,789
but ... yeah. That's nice.
That's a cool one. Okay. So you

961
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:19,259
said -- I'm gonna jump all the
way to the now times. You said

962
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:20,729
you

963
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,589
work for a federal agency and
you do front-end development.

964
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:24,448
That -- I

965
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:27,599
think that's really interesting.
So are there -- well, I guess my

966
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,909
question is like, can you -- are
you able to talk a little bit

967
00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:33,329
about what that's like? Like,
working in a government agency,

968
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:34,986
especially doing front end
stuff? I- I mean, I -- that

969
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:36,643
makes me think of,

970
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:39,135
like, rules and, you know, "Oh,
you have to -- like, a bunch of

971
00:42:39,135 --> 00:42:40,700
regulations you have to follow,"
or something like that. And

972
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:40,816
maybe that's not-

973
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,000
Bekah: Forms and aliens
[chuckles]?

974
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,822
Dan: -the case, but like I --
[laughs] or, yeah. Or Bekah is

975
00:42:42,822 --> 00:42:44,894
gonna- gonna

976
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,014
call DARPA and, you know, get
the aliens coming. But I just

977
00:42:48,014 --> 00:42:49,105
like would like to hear about
it. I'm just curious.

978
00:42:49,514 --> 00:42:53,505
Sadie: Yeah. That's- that's --
yeah. Yeah. So I just started in

979
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:57,255
April. So I'm still trying to
wrap up, like, what can I do and

980
00:42:57,255 --> 00:43:03,251
what can't I do? But from my
understanding, that, all federal

981
00:43:03,251 --> 00:43:06,641
websites need to follow a set of
standards called the US Web

982
00:43:06,641 --> 00:43:09,896
Design Standard. And it's
something that's created by, I

983
00:43:09,896 --> 00:43:13,151
believe by

984
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:18,551
18F? They are like another,
like, kinda like agency — not

985
00:43:18,551 --> 00:43:23,081
like

986
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:28,000
agency, like, big agency — but
like, they create the standards

987
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,566
for websites across federal
agencies, if I understand

988
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,410
correctly. But

989
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:34,594
anyways, the US Web Design
System, it's kind of like- kind

990
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:36,777
of like

991
00:43:36,777 --> 00:43:40,737
Bootstrap where you put your
classes into the HTML to make

992
00:43:40,737 --> 00:43:42,671
sure that the website is
accessible. So, like, button

993
00:43:42,671 --> 00:43:44,605
sizes,

994
00:43:44,606 --> 00:43:48,000
and like screen sizes, and media
queries, and things like that

995
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,626
are all sort of set by these
standards, and you just kind of

996
00:43:51,626 --> 00:43:57,117
drop it into the HTML. Yeah. I'm
still trying to learn that,

997
00:43:57,476 --> 00:44:01,151
but ... yeah. Outside of that,
like, I- I haven't played too

998
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:04,826
much outside of

999
00:44:04,827 --> 00:44:08,697
that. And like, tried to really
customize the website per se,

1000
00:44:08,757 --> 00:44:15,117
because I inherited this- this
website and the properties

1001
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:20,000
for the- for the agency. And so
I don't have the really built

1002
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
out too much, like, by hand.

1003
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:22,700
Dan: Right.

1004
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,481
Sadie: Which is ... good and
bad? [Laughs] But --

1005
00:44:26,952 --> 00:44:28,632
Dan: Well, I mean, like, over
time you'll -- yeah.

1006
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:33,000
Sadie: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It'll
take some time. But, yeah. That

1007
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,371
-- that's what I'm finding most
interesting. It seems like

1008
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:41,532
Jekyll is very favored. And
also, a-all of -- not all. But a

1009
00:44:41,532 --> 00:44:46,271
lot of the websites are on
GitHub. So you can actually see,

1010
00:44:46,302 --> 00:44:50,021
like, how these sites are built.
And if you want to, like, poke

1011
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,056
around, like, it's all there.
Yeah.

1012
00:44:53,487 --> 00:44:54,327
Dan: Nice. That's cool.

1013
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:57,416
Sadie: Yeah [laughs]. Yeah.
Yeah.

1014
00:44:58,211 --> 00:44:59,291
Bekah: So you -- you're using a
lot of Jekyll? Is that what you

1015
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:00,371
said?

1016
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:02,126
Sadie: Yeah. It's Jekyll. Yeah
[laughs].

1017
00:45:02,552 --> 00:45:02,972
Bekah: That's interesting.

1018
00:45:03,936 --> 00:45:04,226
Sadie: Yeah.

1019
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:08,156
Bekah: I -- both of my blogs are
using Jekyll because I'm not

1020
00:45:08,156 --> 00:45:10,481
really

1021
00:45:10,481 --> 00:45:13,500
even sure [chuckles] that's the
direction I went when I first

1022
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:13,871
started. And so

1023
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:16,129
I just kept going with it. And I
feel like Jekyll — this is a

1024
00:45:16,129 --> 00:45:18,382
Jekyll

1025
00:45:18,402 --> 00:45:20,500
tangent — I love using Jekyll,
but I feel like their

1026
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,500
documentation is terrible.

1027
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,000
Sadie: Mm. Mm-hmm.

1028
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,711
Bekah: And I keep hearing people
that love Jekyll they're

1029
00:45:25,711 --> 00:45:28,211
like, "But their community is
great. So you can ask lots of

1030
00:45:28,211 --> 00:45:31,300
questions and they'll get
answered." But I- I just want to

1031
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,512
read it in the

1032
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:35,700
documentation. Just, like,
explain this to me.

1033
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,000
Sadie: [Laughs] Right.

1034
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,581
Bekah: But also, I've never,
like,

1035
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:39,261
contributed to their
documentation. So, that's also

1036
00:45:39,261 --> 00:45:40,941
...

1037
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:43,056
something I should probably do
instead of complaining about it

1038
00:45:43,056 --> 00:45:44,091
[laughs].

1039
00:45:45,146 --> 00:45:48,567
Sadie: I hear that [laughs].
Yeah. I feel that.

1040
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:49,481
Dan: You can complain once in a
while.

1041
00:45:51,442 --> 00:45:53,032
Bekah: That's it. I'm done my
Jekyll rant. Sorry.

1042
00:45:54,472 --> 00:45:55,492
Dan: Oh, man. I- I just --
that's very interesting. I mean,

1043
00:45:55,492 --> 00:45:56,512
I've

1044
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:57,937
done -- I've concentrated on the
front end for, you know, my

1045
00:45:57,937 --> 00:45:59,362
whole

1046
00:45:59,367 --> 00:46:03,411
career. And so -- but I've never
worked with anything, you know,

1047
00:46:03,442 --> 00:46:05,547
that have any external standards
that anybody's looking at in

1048
00:46:05,547 --> 00:46:07,652
the-

1049
00:46:07,652 --> 00:46:09,177
in the code. You know what I
mean? You -- we try to, like, be

1050
00:46:09,177 --> 00:46:10,702
ex- as,

1051
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:11,976
like, accessible as possible and
every- you know, all that stuff,

1052
00:46:11,976 --> 00:46:13,250
but

1053
00:46:13,251 --> 00:46:15,771
it's always just me that's doing
those and en-enforcing it on

1054
00:46:15,771 --> 00:46:18,291
myself

1055
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:19,326
or whatever, you know, or- or
any teammates that I'm working

1056
00:46:19,326 --> 00:46:20,361
with.

1057
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:21,816
But it- it's never coming down
from above, you know what I

1058
00:46:21,816 --> 00:46:23,270
mean?

1059
00:46:23,271 --> 00:46:23,391
Sadie: Mm.

1060
00:46:23,391 --> 00:46:25,300
Dan: And so, that's- that's,
like, gotta be in- a really

1061
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,300
interesting experience to be in
that role-

1062
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:29,500
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

1063
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,791
Dan: -you know? And ... that's

1064
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:34,161
awesome that they're -- that
they are doing to open source

1065
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:35,902
stuff. That's really cool.

1066
00:46:36,262 --> 00:46:40,000
Sadie: Yes. Yeah. There's a lot
of open source of projects from

1067
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,672
the government [chuckles].

1068
00:46:41,512 --> 00:46:42,802
Dan: That's awesome. Yeah. That-
that makes me, like, wonder.

1069
00:46:42,802 --> 00:46:44,092
Yeah,

1070
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:46,500
just now [laughs] -- you know,
I- I always just assume that

1071
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,452
it's all, like, locked

1072
00:46:47,452 --> 00:46:50,000
down, and it's all, whatever --
super-

1073
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,300
Bekah: DARPA?

1074
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,342
Dan: -custom, you know, DARPA-

1075
00:46:52,431 --> 00:46:56,000
DARPA static sites. But no,
they're just open source. I see

1076
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,442
some Jekyll. That's awesome.

1077
00:46:57,672 --> 00:46:58,161
Sadie: [Laughs] Exactly.

1078
00:46:58,311 --> 00:47:02,000
Dan: That's so cool [laughs].
Yeah. Mm. That's cool. Thank you

1079
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,681
for sharing about that. That --
I find that really interesting.

1080
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,300
Sadie: Yeah.

1081
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:07,936
Bekah: Where -- what do you like
best about your job?

1082
00:47:08,822 --> 00:47:12,632
Sadie: Ooh, that's a good
question. I don't know. I feel

1083
00:47:12,632 --> 00:47:16,981
like I'm- I'm gonna get kind of
meta. But that I am at a federal

1084
00:47:17,192 --> 00:47:21,271
agency [laughs], it feels like
it completes, like, a cycle or

1085
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:23,821
something, because my
grandmother and my grandfather

1086
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:26,371
were both in

1087
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:29,551
the army. And my uncles were in,
like, the army and marines. My

1088
00:47:29,551 --> 00:47:32,731
mom

1089
00:47:32,731 --> 00:47:36,931
retired military, like, retired
air force. And so I grew up in

1090
00:47:36,931 --> 00:47:41,822
the military family and always,
like, had that, like, "Ooh, am I

1091
00:47:41,827 --> 00:47:43,864
gonna join the military or not?"
Or, "Am I gonna be, like

1092
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:45,901
[chuckles],

1093
00:47:45,902 --> 00:47:47,431
a contractor or something?" And
I always felt like, "Nah, that's

1094
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:48,960
not

1095
00:47:48,961 --> 00:47:52,501
for me. Nah, that's not- that's
not what I'm gonna do." And I'm

1096
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:55,636
here. Like, I'm- I'm a
contractor now. Like [laughs] --

1097
00:47:55,636 --> 00:47:58,771
so, it's

1098
00:47:59,282 --> 00:48:01,592
just like, "Oh, wow." Like, "A
family cycles are- are a thing."

1099
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:05,000
Bekah: That's such a great
story.

1100
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,300
Sadie: Thank you [laughs].

1101
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:05,500
Dan: Yeah, it's really cool.

1102
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,500
Bekah: I loved that.

1103
00:48:06,871 --> 00:48:09,841
Sadie: Yeah. Yeah. It's so
funny. Yeah. Like ... yeah, my

1104
00:48:09,841 --> 00:48:12,811
mom

1105
00:48:12,811 --> 00:48:16,546
retired, like, two months out
from my 18th birthday. So like,

1106
00:48:16,546 --> 00:48:20,281
it's, like, the

1107
00:48:20,282 --> 00:48:22,576
military and, like, that
connection is just like a part

1108
00:48:22,576 --> 00:48:24,870
of my

1109
00:48:24,876 --> 00:48:27,842
identity. And like, I feel like
that's something that, like, not

1110
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:30,046
too many people know. It's like,
I -- like, I'm- I'm, like,

1111
00:48:30,046 --> 00:48:32,250
looking

1112
00:48:32,251 --> 00:48:33,406
around right now — you can't see
this — but, like, where I am

1113
00:48:33,406 --> 00:48:34,561
right

1114
00:48:34,561 --> 00:48:39,001
now, I grew up actually on the
military base. Like, that's

1115
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:42,751
probably, like, five miles away
from my house. And, I don't

1116
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,761
know. It was just a lot of like,
"Wow," like- like, I've always

1117
00:48:44,761 --> 00:48:46,771
been

1118
00:48:46,771 --> 00:48:49,351
aware of contractors and like
... just that relationship, but

1119
00:48:49,351 --> 00:48:51,931
just

1120
00:48:52,442 --> 00:48:54,136
now being on the other side and
saying like, "Oh," like, "Huh,

1121
00:48:54,136 --> 00:48:55,830
this

1122
00:48:55,831 --> 00:48:58,700
is how- this is how it works."
And like, I can also see, like,

1123
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,791
how intense it is to be in the
military and like the- the sort

1124
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:05,491
of, like, expectations you have
to fulfill that role. Like-

1125
00:49:05,491 --> 00:49:08,191
like, I

1126
00:49:08,192 --> 00:49:11,700
came into this job thinking
like, "Oh," like, "Now I can't,

1127
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:16,000
like, [chuckles] be late for my
job. Or I can't, like, take-

1128
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,092
[chuckles] take off work."
Because

1129
00:49:18,092 --> 00:49:25,081
that's what I saw my mom, like,
having to, like ... I guess

1130
00:49:25,081 --> 00:49:27,136
fulfill or, like, be secure in
her job, but that's -- it's not

1131
00:49:27,136 --> 00:49:29,191
like

1132
00:49:29,192 --> 00:49:31,396
that at all. Like, I- I have a
wonderful team that, like,

1133
00:49:31,396 --> 00:49:33,600
respects

1134
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:37,561
work life balance and like,
people have kids, and like, they

1135
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:40,862
understand, like, you know,
today's not the day, like, just

1136
00:49:40,862 --> 00:49:43,082
come back tomorrow, and it'll be
okay. Like, that sort of thing.

1137
00:49:43,082 --> 00:49:45,302
So,

1138
00:49:45,306 --> 00:49:48,229
yeah. It- it's a -- it's really
deep. But, yeah. That's my

1139
00:49:48,229 --> 00:49:51,152
answer [chuckles].

1140
00:49:53,266 --> 00:49:55,577
Bekah: I like that. I mean,
there's- there's familiarity

1141
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:57,181
there, right? And then there's
comfort that comes with that.

1142
00:49:57,181 --> 00:49:58,785
And

1143
00:49:59,086 --> 00:50:02,700
when you're talking about taking
on a new job, it's really nice

1144
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,686
to be able to have something
like that, where you can feel

1145
00:50:05,686 --> 00:50:07,547
comfortable in some aspect of
what you're doing.

1146
00:50:08,251 --> 00:50:11,311
Sadie: Right. Exactly. Exactly.

1147
00:50:14,086 --> 00:50:18,047
Bekah: Well, we're at just about
time here. Is- is there any last

1148
00:50:18,047 --> 00:50:22,217
piece of advice you have for our
listeners who are prepping for

1149
00:50:22,277 --> 00:50:26,117
interviews or leaving bootcamps
and about to discover the next

1150
00:50:26,117 --> 00:50:27,047
stage of their journey?

1151
00:50:27,467 --> 00:50:33,300
Sadie: Ooh, that's -- okay. I
could say so much. But [laughs]

1152
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:33,646
I hate to say,

1153
00:50:33,646 --> 00:50:37,157
like, something trite, but like,
also, like, one, trust the

1154
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:42,436
process. And then two, you know
more than you think. Like, for

what you can, explain what you-

1160
00:51:00,302 --> 00:51:03,121

you will find your job and you
