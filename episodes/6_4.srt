00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:09,516
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 6, Episode 4 of

2
00:00:09,516 --> 00:00:15,214
the Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:18,693
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:21,393
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:24,094
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:27,213
stories and what they've learned.
And we're here to share it with

7
00:00:27,213 --> 00:00:30,814
you. Here with me today is my
cohost, Dan.

8
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:35,914
Dan Ott: Wuddup, Bek? [Bekah and
Dan laugh] Ho-how's it going?

9
00:00:36,844 --> 00:00:38,433
Bekah: It- it's going wonderfully
[laughs].

10
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:45,694
Dan: Excellent. Today we are
talking with Sadie Jay who is a

11
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:48,993
front-end developer with a
federal agency. We talked about

12
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:54,314
her long experience doing the
interview process, and, yeah. And

13
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:56,834
her experience working at a- at a
government agency as well.

14
00:00:56,954 --> 00:01:00,179
Bekah: Yeah, it was really
interesting to hear how she kind

15
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:04,528
of started in tech. She burnt out,
and left tech for a while, and

16
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:08,278
then decided to give it a second
shot, and she's back doing it

17
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:11,308
again. And it sounds like she's
really excited. But also like,

18
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:14,444
took those lessons that she
learned from that burnout

19
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:18,284
experience and brought them with
her so she doesn't get burnout

20
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:21,343
again. And I think that's really,
really useful because I see that

21
00:01:21,343 --> 00:01:22,513
happen to a lot of people.

22
00:01:23,364 --> 00:01:26,054
Dan: Yeah, totally. I -- it was-
it was interesting hearing her talk

23
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:29,864
about her thought process,
you know, when she was

24
00:01:29,864 --> 00:01:34,903
experiencing the burnout stuff
and- and just taking a break

25
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:38,114
like that, you know, and- and
dealing with it head on. I

26
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:40,364
think it was- it was really cool.
And I think there's a lot of valuable

27
00:01:40,364 --> 00:01:41,084
stuff in there.

28
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:44,914
Bekah: Yep. And we start every
episode of the podcast like we

29
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:48,243
start every Virtual Coffee. We
introduce ourselves with our

30
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:51,993
name, where we're from, what we
do, and a random check-in

31
00:01:52,054 --> 00:02:04,209
question. And we hope you enjoy
this episode. Hi, I'm Bekah. I am

32
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:10,299
a technical community builder
from a small town in Ohio. And an

33
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,028
imaginary class that I wish was
offered. I feel like this is hard

34
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:21,748
because I'm not sure what would
be practical for an imaginary

35
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:29,218
class. And maybe imaginary
classes aren't practical?

36
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:32,300
Dan: Did the imaginary class teach
imaginary things? Or is this like

37
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,193
a chance to learn, you know?

38
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:35,100
Bekah: Oh, for sure. It can teach-

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,500
Dan: Magic or whatever? Mm.

40
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,299
Bekah: -imaginary things. Yeah, I
think I

39
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:47,618
would like to definitely
take a class that watches people

40
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:54,633
have brain scans. And that's not
an imaginary class. I'm kind of

41
00:02:54,633 --> 00:03:00,123
like neurobiology class. But there's
[laughs] gotta be some kind of

42
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:11,508
imaginary aspect to brain scans and
... people. I'm really bad at this

43
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:15,498
question [Dan laughs]. I was the one
that chose it too. So I'd just like

44
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:19,218
makes it worse. I'm just
gonna like look at people's

45
00:03:19,218 --> 00:03:24,408
brains and see what they do.
That's it. It's not imaginary.

46
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:28,248
It's wishful. That's what I wish.
I wish to watch people's brains.

47
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:31,739
Dan: Less of a class and more of
a profession you wish you had?

48
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:37,218
Bekah: [Laughs] Yes, I would love to
be a neurobiologist. That would be

49
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:41,989
fantastic. What? Okay. Maybe an
imaginary class on like studying

50
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,408
black holes by like actually
physically exploring them. Cuz

51
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:46,800
that's not possible.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,200
Dan: Mm.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,568
Bekah: So, is that better?

52
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:54,079
Dan: I don't know [laughs]. I don't
know what to do with this question.

53
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:59,239
Hi, I'm Dan. I do computer
development things in

54
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:03,378
Cleveland, and, yeah.
Imaginary class. I have no -- I

55
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:08,269
mean, I don't really understand this
question [laughs] to tell you the truth.

56
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:14,239
I- I don't know. I guess I'm
gonna go with ... like

57
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:19,278
spaceship flying? Yeah. But, like,
not the boring ones that we have

58
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:21,319
in the reality though, you
know? Or like "Star Wars".

59
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:22,038
Bekah: "Star Wars" spaceship
flying?

60
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:23,538
Dan: Like -- yeah, yeah. Like
teach me how to fly the-

61
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:24,918
Bekah: That's a good imaginary
class.

62
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:26,569
Dan: -the Millennium Falcon or
something, you know? That'd be

63
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:26,778
cool.

64
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,218
Bekah: Yeah, that's what I --
oh, yeah.

65
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:31,158
Dan: As long as I actually got to
fly it. Yeah. All right. That's gonna

66
00:04:31,158 --> 00:04:31,728
be my answer [laughs].

67
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:38,014
Sadie Jay: Okay. Hi, I'm Sadie.
I'm from a small town in the

68
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:42,514
Panhandle, Florida. I am a
front-end developer for a federal

69
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:49,774
agency. And ... an- an imaginary
class. I think I would take -- I

70
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:52,863
don't know. I -- this makes me
think of like when I was in

71
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,244
elementary school and like super
obsessed with like ESP and like

72
00:04:57,274 --> 00:05:01,744
being psychic and things like
that. So I would probably pick

73
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:03,663
some class that develops like
your psychic abilities. I don't know.

74
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:06,319
Bekah: I think-

75
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:06,619
Dan: I like that.

76
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:09,798
Bekah: -that is a good -- an
excellent answer. You have

77
00:05:09,803 --> 00:05:13,769
definitely won this round of
intro questions [laughs].

78
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:16,000
Sadie: [Laughs] Thank you.

78
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:19,428
Dan: Yeah. My first answer was
gonna be like, learn, you know,

79
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:20,569
learn the Force, you know?

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,200
Sadie: Ooh.

80
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:23,000
Bekah: Mm. That's a good one.

81
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:24,319
Dan: Then I was thinking about
spaceships would be fun too, so

82
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:27,949
-- and a little more practical.
I was worried that -- I think that,

83
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:28,500
canonically-

84
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:28,700
Bekah: How will you --

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,778
Dan: -you have to, like, have
the -- be able to use

84
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:34,800
the force to learn -- like in the
net -- it's not like everybody

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,119
can learn it,

85
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:38,000
you know? It would be a bummer to
sign up for that class, and make

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,329
it there, and

86
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:39,000
then you find out you-

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,000
Sadie: Can't work it. You aren't
eligible [laughs].

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,319
Dan: -can't- can't -- right
[laughs].

87
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:45,064
Bekah: You can watch everybody
else use the Force, but you're

88
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:45,334
stuck.

89
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:46,000
Dan: Right, right.

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Sadie: You miss the
[unintelligible] [laughs].

00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,108
Dan: It's not like everybody can
use a --

90
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:51,108
everybody could use a- a -- or
learn how to fly spaceships.

91
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:54,139
Bekah: I feel like I want a class
on communicating with aliens, but

92
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:57,649
I feel like DARPA already has
that or something like -- it's out

93
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:02,781
there. We just don't know about it
yet [laughs]. Well, welcome Sadie.

94
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:06,122
Thanks for being here with us
today. We're very, very excited

95
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:10,041
to have you. and we always like
to start off with your tech

96
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:13,762
origin stories. So how did you get
to this point in your tech journey?

97
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:21,516
Sadie: Oh, wow. Yeah. That's ...
a good question. I feel like it

98
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:25,956
was a winding journey for sure.
Like, I- I didn't really grow

99
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:32,137
up with a desire to be in tech.
Like. my household computer

100
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,406
was just the computer that let me
get on cartoonnetwork.com and

101
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:41,797
play games. Like, it wasn't much
past that. But I would say,

102
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:48,276
right after I graduated with
my bachelor's degree in

103
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:53,932
psychology, I got into drawing
and painting. Like, and this was

104
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:57,112
just like a random desire that I
had. I was like, "Ah, I just wanna

105
00:06:57,112 --> 00:07:02,391
learn painting. I'm just gonna take
a class." So I did [chuckles]. And, like,

106
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:07,312
fell in love. And from that I
wanted to like find a career that

107
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:12,141
let me combine psychology and,
like, drawing or visual arts. So I

108
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:15,951
was like, "Okay, maybe web design
somehow? Cuz that would also let

109
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:21,192
me work remotely and give me some
flexibility." So I went to a bootcamp.

110
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:25,927
I went to Skill Crush and
signed up for one of their

111
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:28,956
courses. It was like a web design
course or visual design course.

112
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:36,187
This was back in like 2017 ... like,
several years ago. But I wanted

113
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:38,677
to, like, test out the waters to
see if that was something I would

114
00:07:38,682 --> 00:07:44,137
be interested in. And, like, it- it
seemed good enough. Like, I- I

115
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:47,317
felt like I could do it. So then
I signed up for my master -- my

116
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:52,101
master's, specializing in web
design and online communication.

117
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:57,081
And in that program, like, we did
both web design and also web

118
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:01,072
development. And I realized that
like, actually web development

119
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:06,891
was more my thing and not so much
the web design. So, yeah. So

120
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:11,122
that was like the really -- the
kickoff to my tech journey, for

121
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:15,351
sure. But after I graduated, I --
there was another pivot. Like, I

122
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:20,317
was completely burnt out on tech
and anything tech related. Like, I

123
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:24,966
couldn't bear to think about like
coding. And I remember like I

124
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:29,257
applied to some internship and
got a LeetCode challenge, but at

125
00:08:29,257 --> 00:08:32,736
the time I didn't know what that
was. So I was like, "Oh, wow. I

126
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:35,437
just graduated with this degree,"
and like, "I can't even use it."

127
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:40,206
Like, I don't know what, like, how
to do this thing with JavaScript

128
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:44,106
that they want me to do. So it
just completely, like, demoralized

129
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:48,621
me and like crushed my
confidence. So I became a yoga

130
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:52,701
teacher. I was out in Brooklyn
and doing that, like, yoga life and-

00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:53,152
Bekah: Awesome.

131
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:56,500
Sadie: -like [chuckles] meeting
with cool people. And then I

00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,231
got into the travel

132
00:08:57,231 --> 00:09:02,692
industry and did that for a year.
But all of that ended around 2020

133
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:07,192
when I left the job, and then the
pandemic started, and all that. So

134
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:13,086
it gave me time to reflect. And I
had to move back home after being

135
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,267
in Brooklyn for a few years. And
I really thought, I was like,

136
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:20,496
"Okay, what am I gonna do next?"
Cuz, like, I don't want to be here,

137
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,736
like Florida, which is home for
me. Like, I don't wanna be here

138
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:27,277
forever, but I do wanna take the
time to, like, make sure that, like,

139
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:33,547
I'm going in a direction that I
feel good about and kind of came

140
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:40,687
to the conclusion that, like, I
didn't really give tech a try. Like, I-

141
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:45,547
I let the burnout, like, kind of
like take over. I don't know. I

142
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:52,417
guess, like, my direction or just
like ... I dunno, just had me stopping

143
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,996
my tracks. So I was like, "You
know what? I'm gonna give this a

144
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:59,647
college try," like, "Imma- imma
do this again." And this

145
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:03,547
time I'm going to make sure I
have community around me. And

146
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:07,912
that's how I found y'all, I found
Virtual Coffee. So I restarted my

147
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:11,631
bootcamp, restarted Skill Crush,
and did the front-end developer

148
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:15,892
intensive. But this time, I was
very intentional about joining

149
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:19,642
community, like being very active
in Virtual Coffee, and I wanted

150
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:23,991
to do the open source thing. So
it would just so happen that

151
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:31,971
the kickoff for the Hacktoberfest
month was like a week or two

152
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:34,807
away. So that's when I joined
Virtual Coffee. I got to sit in

153
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:38,407
and watch Dan do the -- like,
how to contribute to open source.

154
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:41,000
And, yeah. So it- it all just went
from there.

155
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,000
Dan: Awesome.

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,376
Sadie: [Chuckles] Yeah, so I ended

155
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:47,647
up like contributing to like five
projects and like, I contributed

156
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,976
to a couple of IBM projects. I
got to do a demo day with them.

157
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:58,537
And then, started the job search
or -- in, like, February? And

158
00:10:58,956 --> 00:11:02,437
that was another beast of its own
where it took like nine weeks.

159
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:08,317
And just hundreds of applications
to get this job that I have now.

160
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:10,927
Yeah. That's how I got here.
Yeah [laughs].

161
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,000
Dan: I mean, that --

161
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:17,692
Bekah: That's awesome. I love
that story. I -- there's just --

162
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:24,741
I like that you have gone through
a lot of different, like,

163
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:28,000
different journeys on this
journey here, right?

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,312
Sadie: Absolutely.

164
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,402
Bekah: You've done a lot of different
things, but also, like, coming back from

165
00:11:31,402 --> 00:11:35,932
burnout. I imagine that's gotta
be kind of a hard decision to

166
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:41,782
make. What really kind of pushed
you in that directions? Like,

167
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:44,331
"Okay, fine. I'm gonna do this one
more time."

168
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:49,792
Sadie: Right. That's- that's a
good question. I think, one, time.

169
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:55,701
Time helped. Cuz I had graduated
2018 and then I felt like I could

170
00:11:55,701 --> 00:12:00,000
entertain the thought of tech
again, like, what? A few years

171
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,532
later? So,

171
00:12:00,532 --> 00:12:06,412
2021? So, really, it was just time
and space that helped, I would

172
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:11,721
say for the most part. But also,
I don't know. I know, like, I

173
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:16,042
wanted flexibility in my job and
like, where I worked. Like, that

174
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:19,912
was also the catalyst of going
into the master's degree program.

175
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:24,201
So, like, I think that thread just
continued. And I was like, "Okay, I

176
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:28,672
think I could do tech again."
Because I've tried, like, also

177
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:31,942
tried writing on the side a
little bit, but that didn't feel

178
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:38,841
quite as a fit. So I think just
... I dunno. The reflection and

179
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:43,522
wanting to like challenge myself
and see something to completion

180
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:44,392
also helped.

181
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:48,703
Dan: Can you talk a little bit
about your experience?

182
00:12:48,823 --> 00:12:53,234
So, if I have this right, you did a --
the bootcamp, and then you went to

183
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:54,500
a master's program after that?

184
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:54,800
Sadie: Mm-hmm. I did, yeah.

185
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,803
Dan: So, that's like a lot of
school, like, [laughs]

184
00:12:56,808 --> 00:13:00,104
in all together. Can you talk a little --
I- I don't think I've actually -- we've

185
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:03,923
talked to anybody who is learn
web design stuff or web

186
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:07,524
development stuff in a master's
program. Could you -- would you

187
00:13:07,524 --> 00:13:09,300
mind sharing a little bit about
what that was like?

188
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Sadie: Sure. Yeah.

189
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,033
Dan: And- and,

188
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,283
especially, like, compared to --
since you did it right after the

189
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:16,823
bootcamp, maybe- maybe compared
to what- what it was like-

191
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:17,004
Sadie: Right.

190
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,193
Dan: -yep. Yeah, you know, the
different approaches and everything.

191
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:24,203
Sadie: Yeah. So, okay. So I did
the bootcamp. And I- I don't even

192
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:28,313
can know if I completed the
course, like, before I did the

193
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:31,464
master's. Like, it was just
enough to be like, "Okay, this

194
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:35,994
seems like something I could do."
So I went into my master's

195
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:40,673
program without any knowledge of
code or anything. But that was

196
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:44,604
the -- like the setup for the
degree. Like, you didn't have to

197
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:50,364
have any prior knowledge. But,
I don't know. I don't -- I kind of

198
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:56,859
don't know how to, like, give more
details, cuz it was -- it- it -- like

199
00:13:56,859 --> 00:14:03,188
college. Like you -- like, we
had four classes a semester.

200
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:06,879
That's what I signed up for. And,
like, the very first class was

201
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:13,058
like a web design principles, and
like, it went into HTML, and maybe

202
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:15,639
a little bit of CSS, and I don't
even think we touched JavaScript

203
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,553
that much in that first class.
And then it built up from there. We

204
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:23,063
learned like -- it was mostly DOM
manipulation. Cuz it- it wasn't

205
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:27,173
like a computer science class, so
we didn't learn, like, algorithms

206
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:30,293
or data structures or anything
like that. But basically, like,

207
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:36,293
how to create websites, and, like,
webpages with an eye for design.

208
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:44,514
We also learn like Adobe
Suite, and social media, and

209
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:48,818
like, analytics for websites, and
things like that. Like, the capstone

210
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:56,078
project was to create a WordPress
site for a local company. And our

211
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:01,389
cohort was divided up into teams.
And that was like -- that was

212
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:06,519
the peak, like the end of the
program. But I say all that to

213
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:12,339
say, like -- so, I did that, finished
in 2018, and then went back into

214
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:19,719
the bootcamp 2021. And I- I
feel like I retained enough

215
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:23,408
information, but it was enough to
know that like, "Oh, yeah. I

216
00:15:23,408 --> 00:15:30,038
remember learning that in school."
So I felt like what I learned in

217
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:33,339
the bootcamp and what I learned
in school were comparable, but it

218
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:37,538
was just that I had more time in
school to learn the things and to

219
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:42,639
like, kinda like, dive into each
thing that was taught, like each

220
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:47,964
aspect of HTML or CSS or JavaScript.
Whereas the bootcamp was like,

221
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:52,163
basically, the same topics but
just in a more condensed

222
00:15:52,224 --> 00:15:57,894
time space even though it was
self-paced. So, yeah. It was

223
00:15:57,894 --> 00:15:58,524
really interesting.

224
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,683
Dan: Yeah, I guess it makes
sense.

225
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:06,129
Bekah: So, the -- so, after you did
the master's program, then you went

226
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:11,198
into the bootcamp, was there
any interview prep that you did

227
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:14,739
as part of the master's program
or was that -- did you do that in

228
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:14,918
the [laughs] -- you face it.
[Laughs] No.

229
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:23,649
Sadie: [Laughs] Yeah, no. For the
master's program absolutely not.

230
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:27,759
And I feel like that's why,
like, I was so blindsided by the

231
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:35,048
LeetCode challenge, but, yeah.
What -- the- the, like, real

232
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:40,239
world aspect of the bootcamp --
oh, not the bootcamp. Of the

233
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:43,568
master's degree was like a
internship. So I did an

234
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:48,698
internship at American
Document POV, a media company.

235
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:53,589
And I'm- I'm smiling because
like, I don't -- y'all can't see me,

236
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:57,889
but I'm smiling. And [laughs] and I'm
laughing because, like, it was an

237
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:01,899
internship in the digital team,
but it didn't have anything to do

238
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:05,108
with, like, the website or
anything. So I had to, like,

239
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:08,439
shoehorn, like, "Hey, I- I need to
do something with WordPress. I need

240
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:12,338
to do something [laughs]." But what
it ended up being was more like me

241
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:16,628
working with the producers and
doing like other cool stuff. But

242
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:19,298
yeah, no. That was the extent of
like the real world application

243
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:23,798
for the master's program. So
I was like completely lost when I

244
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:27,578
was job hunting and ... yeah
[laughs].

245
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,993
Bekah: I think most people are
completely lost when they're job

246
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:34,114
hun- hunting, you know? It's just
like, there's not a lot of

247
00:17:34,114 --> 00:17:37,804
preparation and job interviews
are all over the place. So you

248
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:41,943
just never know what to expect.
And like, having to prepare so

249
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:46,263
much for each one of them makes
it really, really hard. Did you

250
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:48,453
do interview prep with Skill
Crush?

251
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:53,019
Sadie: I did. Yeah. So the front-end
developer intensive includes

252
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:59,409
a job hunting. Coach — like a
career coach — that helps you, like,

253
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:04,088
with prepare your resume, and like,
prepare your cover letter, and get

254
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:09,068
your like one minute, like ...
what's it called? Like a one

255
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:12,489
minute, like, spiel about yourself
and ... I don't know. Just

256
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:13,000
interview practice and-

257
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,000
Bekah: An elevator pitch.

258
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,608
Sadie: -how to answer
questions. Exactly. Elevator

257
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:19,989
pitch. Yeah, so Skill Crush had
that. And that really opened my

258
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:26,138
eyes to, like, how to be strategic
when job hunting. And like -- kinda

259
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:28,898
like understand what to expect
when interviewing in the tech

260
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:33,909
field. And, yeah. Without that, I-
I really don't think I would've --

261
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:38,798
or it- it either would have
taken me a lot longer to find my

262
00:18:38,804 --> 00:18:44,078
job or I would have stopped again.
And probably would've said maybe

263
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:45,048
tech just not for me.

264
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:49,304
Bekah: Yeah. And that's so
unfortunate that there are so

265
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:53,534
many people trying to break into
tech and are just quitting before

266
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:57,344
they get there, because the inter-
and the interview process is not

267
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,693
reflective of most of the stuff
that you're going to be doing.

268
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:05,753
Sadie: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And like, without
that knowledge of like, "Oh, like, I

269
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:10,554
actually don't maybe need to know
how to, like, do this LeetCode-y

270
00:19:10,554 --> 00:19:16,314
thing," like, if you don't have
that understanding, then like -- I feel

271
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:19,134
like that's what feels like the-
the tutorial loop were like, "Oh,

272
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:23,364
I need to know how to do this
weird niche thing." Or like, "Maybe

273
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:27,144
I actually don't know enough, so
I need to keep going." Like ...

274
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:30,804
I don't know. It -- the interview
process is so, like, demoralizing.

275
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:32,034
Or it can be.

276
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:35,814
Bekah: That's a really good word
for -- I even think, like, some of

277
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:40,703
the best interview processes are
still very exhausting and tough

278
00:19:40,703 --> 00:19:46,644
to get through. So, why don't you
-- can you walk us through what it

279
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,534
was like to prepare for an
interview?

280
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:54,909
Sadie: Oh, that's a good question
[chuckles]. Hmm. That's a good

281
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:59,423
question. I feel like what I did
would be to like, look at the job

282
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:02,213
website, and like, look at the
people that I'm interviewing with,

283
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:04,824
and like, kinda stalk their
Instagram -- or not Instagram [laughs].

284
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:09,743
Their LinkedIn. I dunno why I
said Instagram. But, yeah.

285
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:13,044
Stalk their LinkedIn a little bit
and try to find, like, some sort of

286
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:18,173
commonality that I may have with
them and have the idea to bring

287
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:23,003
it up. Even though, like, I'm
really shy and I probably won't

288
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:26,378
ever bring up like, "Hey, I looked
at your LinkedIn." And I noticed,

289
00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:29,739
like, I'm not that kind of
person. But just having that, like,

290
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:33,128
background behind that person
that I'm gonna be interviewing

291
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:38,318
help me feel a little more
confident. I would also try

292
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:42,818
to gather a few questions.
VC-er, Jennifer, I don't

293
00:20:42,848 --> 00:20:46,179
remember how to say her last
name. But she has a list of

294
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:49,959
questions to ask during an
interview. Like, to the

295
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:53,979
interviewer, to try and engage
like you're fit with the role in

296
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:58,628
the company. And I would like,
look -- go back to that, to

297
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:02,138
that page, and like, pick out
questions for every single

298
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:05,858
interview that I had to make sure
that like, "Okay, this is what I

299
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:08,858
need to know about this role and
about the company to make sure

300
00:21:08,864 --> 00:21:16,058
that I'm going to fit with them."
So in order to make it a- a- a process

301
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:19,013
of like I'm also interviewing
the interviewer. Like, it's not

302
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:23,034
just me. It's- it's a two way
thing that I need to also be fit

303
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:24,894
-- a fit, and they need to be a
fit with me.

304
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:28,086
Dan: Yeah, I think that's- I
think that's really important. And

305
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:30,425
it can get lost sometimes,
especially-

306
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:31,391
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

307
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,641
Dan: -I don't know. On long
journeys [laughs], on long, you know,

308
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,931
struggles. But I -- so I- I was
gonna ask them -- it made me think,

309
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:43,461
did you run into any, you know,
you said you were doing this for

310
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:44,000
so long and-

311
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,300
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

312
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,820
Dan: -how many did you say
you did? How many interviews did

311
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,260
you say? I- can't remember how
many, but like a lot-

312
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:49,086
Sadie: That was at least --

313
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:49,760
Dan: -right?

314
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:51,300
Sadie: It was a lot of interviews,
for sure.

315
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:51,500
Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

315
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,455
Sadie: It was like 250
applications and ... yeah.

316
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,700
Dan: Yeah. Wow. A-and so, like,
were- were there -- I mean,

00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,691
you don't have to, like, call

317
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:02,990
them out or anything [chuckles], but
were there any times where you were --

318
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,780
you got down the road a little
bit and were like, "Oh, I don't

319
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,451
know if this is actually a good
fit for me," you know, on your

320
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:08,840
side?

321
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:12,622
Sadie: Right. That's a good
question. There's been a few

322
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:17,785
times, I would say. But even when
that happened, I would try to go

323
00:22:17,785 --> 00:22:21,474
into it thinking like, "Okay, this
is interview practice." Or like,

324
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,125
say, I got a take-home or some,
like, technical test. I would say,

325
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:29,545
"Okay, this may be outta my
wheelhouse, but I may -- I'm still

326
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:33,115
gonna give X amount of time to
it, just to see what I can learn

327
00:22:33,115 --> 00:22:37,884
from this." Like take-home or from
this interview or from this

328
00:22:37,884 --> 00:22:41,464
interaction that I can then
hopefully improve, the next time I

329
00:22:41,464 --> 00:22:42,105
have an interview.

330
00:22:42,746 --> 00:22:45,115
Dan: Hm. I think that's an awesome
attitude. I, you know, I've-

331
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:48,655
I've -- we've had several people
suggest, like, taking interviews

332
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:51,776
even when you're not actively
looking for jobs [laughs].

333
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:55,945
Sometimes to do that practice
cuz -- and it's just like you both

334
00:22:55,945 --> 00:23:00,596
were saying, it's- it's so hard
and -- emotionally hard, and also

335
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:03,895
just like intellectually hard.
And I- I feel -- I mean,

336
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:06,476
interviewing is absolutely a
skill that is separate from

337
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,700
everything else, right?

338
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,000
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

339
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,391
Dan: And ... like any skill, I
think you can

338
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:14,770
get better at it with practice.
But I- I love that attitude

339
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,621
that you have. I mean, it's just
like, "Okay, this might not be

340
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:20,665
perfect or whatever, but I'm
still gonna go through, and build

341
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,546
up the skills or whatever
[laughs]." That's awesome.

342
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:23,550
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

343
00:23:23,931 --> 00:23:26,810
Bekah: Yeah, it's really hard.
Even that idea of, like, practicing

344
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,201
an interview -- you know, like
going on practice interviews, I

345
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:36,770
find to be incredibly
overwhelming to -- I have to

346
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,701
mentally prepare myself and I'm
trying to, like, make that shift

347
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,840
in mindset of, you know, "What --
there aren't stakes here. I'm not

348
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,101
being judged. This is practice to
learn something." And- and try and

349
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:52,010
flip it, kind of like how you said,
'Where you're interviewing the

350
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,211
company as well.' Because it's
-- it might not be a good fit.

351
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:59,480
And I would say, like, that's some
of the most advice that I give to

352
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,790
people who are interviewing for
their first job. They're like,

353
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:05,445
"Oh, well, what do you think about
this?" Like, that's a- that's a

354
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:09,226
red flag. I wouldn't go through
that. And I think maybe as I

355
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:13,246
identify what red flags are -- I
will say the more I interview,

356
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:16,875
the more I'm able to identify
what flags are. Because I put

357
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:19,726
myself in situations where I'm
like, "This is great." And then I'm

358
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:22,546
like, "This is not great." And I
should have been able to figure

359
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,000
this out before I got into this
position.

360
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,300
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

361
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,766
Bekah: So at least, like,

360
00:24:27,826 --> 00:24:31,006
keeping track of that maybe feels
like, "All right, this is

361
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:36,066
progress. I'm learning something."
And now -- next time, I'm never, never

362
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:38,000
gonna interview for anything
ever again. I've just [laughs]

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,405
-- want starting my

363
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:45,276
own company next because I don't
wanna have to go through that.

364
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:49,715
But if- if- if in the off chance
I do have to go through it, I- I

365
00:24:49,715 --> 00:24:53,615
really want to approach it with
the 'I'm interviewing you first.'

366
00:24:53,615 --> 00:24:54,111
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

366
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:59,601
Bekah: And- and that kind of like
changes the power dynamic in the

367
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:02,810
situation. And I think kind of
alleviates some of that stress

368
00:25:02,816 --> 00:25:06,351
that you get going into those
interviews where it's like

369
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:10,250
somebody is staring at me right
now. Well, like, "Hey, I'm staring

370
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:11,381
right back at you, buddy." So --

371
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:13,550
Sadie: Right, right. Exactly.

372
00:25:14,176 --> 00:25:16,817
Bekah: So, how long did you prep
for your interviews?

373
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:23,116
Sadie: That's a good
question. It would depend.

374
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:27,196
Like, I know when I was first
starting out my job- my job

375
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:30,406
hunting process, I would be
really diligent about, "Okay. I'm

376
00:25:30,406 --> 00:25:33,826
gonna like, make sure I have my
list of questions ready, make

377
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,886
sure I, like, review the website,
make sure I look at everybody, and

378
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:41,866
all this stuff." But the more I
got, like, used to interviewing, I

379
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:45,047
would say the- the less I actually
like sat down and prepped for the

380
00:25:45,047 --> 00:25:51,376
interviews which I don't know if I
would recommend or not, but ... I

381
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:55,576
don't know. I just -- I guess, I got
just more comfortable, like, being

382
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:58,876
in that space of, "Okay, this is
the thing that we're doing. Like,

383
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:01,666
we're both trying to gauge
whether or not we're a fit, and

384
00:26:03,676 --> 00:26:07,366
we'll see what happens from there."
So -- if that makes sense [Chuckles].

385
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,791
Bekah: Yeah. No, I love that. It
shows that you're gaining

386
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:15,432
confidence as you go forward and
you've done these practices. So, you

387
00:26:15,432 --> 00:26:18,942
know, that- that's more -- I think
that, you know, that's also one

388
00:26:18,942 --> 00:26:22,872
of those issues where people who
are continually interviewing are

389
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:27,281
just pushing themselves so hard
to do this prep over and over and

390
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:30,642
over. And that also kind of leads
to that situation of, like, you

391
00:26:30,642 --> 00:26:34,727
talked about. Like, burning out in
tech. There's definitely that

392
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:39,287
burnout in the interview process.
And so sometimes you have to take

393
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:41,386
a break. And the- the other part
of that is, like, when you're

394
00:26:41,386 --> 00:26:44,656
interviewing so much, you don't
have time to be working on, like,

395
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:48,047
personal projects or other
things. It's like a full time

396
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:48,217
job.

397
00:26:48,616 --> 00:26:52,156
Sadie: [Laughs] Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.
That was one of the tips that I

398
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:58,126
got while job hunting and
with the career coach, was that

399
00:26:58,132 --> 00:27:02,567
like, you can like stop trying to
keep up with personal projects.

400
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:07,682
Like, this is what you need to be
doing. And, like, once you secure your

401
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:10,741
job, then you can start your
personal projects back up and be,

402
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:16,711
like, getting paid for it. But,
yeah. Like, the idea was that

403
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:22,291
like, you could do both, but
like, you probably better off not

404
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:26,281
so you can completely focus on --
like your time and energy on

405
00:27:26,342 --> 00:27:28,442
interviewing. And then when
you're not interviewing, you can,

406
00:27:28,622 --> 00:27:32,852
like, be off and like, live your
life. So, yeah. You know?

407
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:36,671
Bekah: Yeah. I like the idea too,
of like giving yourself

408
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:40,060
permission. You can have
permission. It's okay to not be

409
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,451
working on these personal
projects. And I even think that

410
00:27:43,451 --> 00:27:46,510
it's okay to take a break from
interviewing, you know? I know

411
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:50,141
that people feel like they're
losing momentum or they're not

412
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:53,800
ever going to be able to find the
next interview if they're not

413
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,310
doing it all the time. But, you
know, if you're burning yourself

414
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:01,750
out before you start, then you're
gonna start burnt out too. And

415
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,800
that's not where you wanna be.

416
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,131
Sadie: Mm. Mm. Very true.

417
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:12,790
Bekah: So, as you were looking
for a job, what was your method

418
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,330
of applying? Were you applying?
Were you reaching out to people

419
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,780
personally? What kind of was the
right direction for you?

420
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:25,675
Sadie: Oh, that's a great
question. First, I started off

421
00:28:25,675 --> 00:28:30,605
just applying. So, I- I think, I
started off using like LinkedIn

422
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:35,546
and ... maybe just LinkedIn at first.
But then I started getting more

423
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:39,476
plugged into like the different
job sites, like remote and -- like

424
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:45,086
different remote job boards cuz I
knew I wanted to be remote. Then

425
00:28:45,086 --> 00:28:50,816
the further along I got into my,
like, application groove, I

426
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:55,316
started reaching out to hiring
managers on LinkedIn, and even,

427
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:59,066
like, other engineers that were at
companies that I saw were either

428
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:03,205
hiring or that I thought would be
interesting to work at. And from

429
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:06,371
there I would try to make a
connection and be like, "Hey," like,

430
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:09,490
"I'm looking for engineering roles,"
or, "I see that you have, like, a

431
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:14,171
software engineer role open.
Who should I talk to, basically?"

432
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:18,971
And so, sometimes I wouldn't get a
response, which is fine. But when

433
00:29:18,971 --> 00:29:23,770
I did get a response, it would
-- usually I would get an

434
00:29:23,776 --> 00:29:28,990
interview and like, be able to put
a name to a face and, like, start a

435
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,086
conversation. So that- that was also
another thing that I learned that

436
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:35,996
I feel like I would probably do
more of, would be to actually

437
00:29:35,996 --> 00:29:39,925
reach out to people on LinkedIn
and like, have a conversation, as

438
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:45,536
opposed to just applying or even
not even apply. Cuz I found that,

439
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:51,415
like ... sometimes I would apply
to a job and like, have the

440
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:55,405
conversation with the hiring
manager, and then they would say,

441
00:29:55,405 --> 00:29:59,306
"Okay, maybe you're not so much of
a fit for this role per se, but

442
00:29:59,306 --> 00:30:02,635
we have something coming down the
pipeline that you may be a better

443
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:06,506
fit for." And it just kind of
opened my eyes of like, "Oh," like,

444
00:30:06,536 --> 00:30:09,700
"Wait a minute." Like, "I just
need to talk to people [laughs]."

00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,155
Like, this is -- I

445
00:30:11,161 --> 00:30:15,566
feel like I unlocked the key. Like,
I didn't know this before. But,

446
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:22,046
yeah. Yeah. I would -- yeah.
That was ... very eye opening.

447
00:30:23,414 --> 00:30:25,125
Dan: So, the people you were
reaching out to-

448
00:30:25,154 --> 00:30:25,375
Sadie: Mm.

449
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:29,265
Dan: -wait. Explain to me again.
Like, how you were choosing who to

450
00:30:29,265 --> 00:30:30,015
reach out to?

451
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:34,288
Sadie: So, I would -- okay. Say,
I would find a role that was

452
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:38,159
interesting. So I would then go
into LinkedIn, and search the

453
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,638
company name, and then, like, quote
hiring or manager or director or

454
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:47,939
something -- like, some higher up
or someone that's gonna be in the,

455
00:30:48,118 --> 00:30:52,800
like, hiring panel or something.
And then I'd pick someone-

456
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

456
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,778
Sadie: -whose title matched, and
then reach out to them. Yeah.

457
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,288
Dan: Yeah, yeah. Okay. So you'd
find a- you'd find a job opening

458
00:31:01,288 --> 00:31:02,808
on a- on a board or something
like that. And then-

459
00:31:02,808 --> 00:31:03,000
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

460
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,814
Dan: -and then you'd

459
00:31:03,814 --> 00:31:07,679
do some homework and -- yeah,
that's really cool. I love that.

460
00:31:07,683 --> 00:31:10,138
I like -- that's a great- that's a
great tip. I mean -- and I think

461
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:14,000
that's like a -- I mean, aside from
the sneakiness of it [laughs]-

462
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:14,500
Sadie: Yeah [laughs].

463
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,239
Dan: -it seems like a

462
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:18,509
really good, you know, a- a --
like, connecting with people is --

463
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,118
almost always a good thing, you
know what I mean? And- and like,

464
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:24,959
as long as, I assume, you're --
I'm sure you are doing it sort of

465
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:27,568
respectfully and with some
knowledge, you know? And not

466
00:31:27,568 --> 00:31:33,028
just blasting out the same thing
to everybody used -- you know,

467
00:31:33,118 --> 00:31:33,500
whatever-

468
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:33,700
Sadie: Yeah, yeah.

469
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,929
Dan: -a million different
people. Yeah, that's great. I

468
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:37,558
love- I love that idea.

469
00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:39,179
Sadie: Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:43,169
Bekah: It- it- it personalizes it,
right? Because before, you're a

471
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:47,489
name on a sheet of a paper or an
internet form or whatever, but

472
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:51,449
now there's more. There's a face
to it, there's a voice to who

473
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:55,199
they're looking at. And then,
hiring managers or whoever can

474
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:58,048
make that connection, like, "Oh,
okay. I know this person," you

475
00:31:58,054 --> 00:32:00,509
know? Even if you haven't had an
in depth conversation, there's

476
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:04,499
something about like, oh, I- I do
-- there is already a connection

477
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:08,618
there that makes it -- you're- you're
already a half, a step above -- in

478
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,788
front of everybody else in that
pile. And that, you know, that can

479
00:32:12,788 --> 00:32:14,300
make the difference, you know?

480
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:14,500
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

481
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,808
Bekah: So, is that the job that
you're

480
00:32:16,814 --> 00:32:19,808
currently at? Did that start with
you reaching out to somebody?

481
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:28,124
Sadie: No. It's funny. I- I saw that
job in like a- like an email

482
00:32:28,334 --> 00:32:32,953
list. It's called Words of Mouth,
I believe? And they post like all

483
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:36,554
these cool jobs. But -- so, I saw
that one. And then I was about to

484
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,874
reach out to someone when someone
in my bootcamp at Skill Crush

485
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:43,453
was like, "Hey, you should apply
to this job. Like, we've been

486
00:32:43,453 --> 00:32:47,834
talking, and they think that you
might be a great fit." So I was

487
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:52,124
like, "Okay," like, "Sweet," like,
"I just saw this job." So, yeah. Like,

488
00:32:52,124 --> 00:32:58,588
it was, again, like that community
connection of like, "Hey --," like,

489
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:01,709
yeah. The community connection.

490
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Dan: That's really cool.

490
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,489
Bekah: That --

491
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,300
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

492
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,200
Dan: So they had already heard
of you before you even-

491
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,459
Sadie: Yeah.

491
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:07,000
Dan: -chat? Nice.

492
00:33:07,000--> 00:33:09,000
Sadie: [Laughs] Yeah. Yeah.

493
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,148
Dan: [Laughs] Isn't it funny that,
the way that that works out, lots of

492
00:33:12,148 --> 00:33:14,878
times, where you've done so many
applications and stuff, and then

493
00:33:14,878 --> 00:33:15,700
this- this one that actually
works?

494
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,200
Sadie: Right. [Laughs] Right.

495
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,269
Dan: Like, came about in some s-
some

494
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:20,068
strange connection in some other
way?

495
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Sadie: Yes [laughs].

496
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:20,800
Dan: Yeah? 

495
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:21,500
Sadie: Exactly.

496
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,500
Dan: That's awesome.

497
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:22,788
Sadie: Exactly.

496
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:26,023
Bekah: One of my favorite things
is when people reach out to me

497
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:27,703
and they're like, "Hey, do you
know anybody that would be good

498
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:31,500
for this job?" And then like, "I
can -- like, yes, I do," you know?

499
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,2,00 
Sadie: Yes [laughs]. I understand
[laughs].

499
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,923
Bekah: I think, like, I'm about to
maybe submit my fifth referral to

500
00:33:35,923 --> 00:33:39,000
somebody -- for somebody at
Deepgram. I just like --

501
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,300
[chuckles] eventually, somebody's
gonna be a good fit-

502
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:41,700
Sadie: Yes.

503
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,163
Bekah: -and I'm gonna help
them find it, you know [laughs]?

502
00:33:43,598 --> 00:33:48,689
Sadie: [Unintelligible] Yeah. You
never know, like, yeah. I- I can only

503
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:51,749
imagine, or like, even in being
in that position of, like, someone

504
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:56,864
having referred me. Like, the
gratitude, like, is immeasurable.

505
00:33:56,864 --> 00:34:00,614
So, yeah. You're doing amazing
work, Bekah.

506
00:34:01,364 --> 00:34:04,500
Bekah: Oh, thank you. I- I also
like-

507
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,000
Dan: Just to say -- oh, go ahead.

508
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,884
Bekah: -well, I just wanna say,
too,

507
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:10,034
when people reach out to me from
the community, and they're like,

508
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:13,514
"Hey, I wanna apply to this job.
Would you mind, like, sending a DM

509
00:34:13,514 --> 00:34:16,634
on my behalf? Cuz I know you're
connected with this person."

510
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:16,724
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

510
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:19,700
Bekah: And most times I do.
Sometimes there are people that

511
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,173
I'm like, "I've

511
00:34:20,173 --> 00:34:24,298
never been in a room with you or
had a conversation with you prior

512
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:28,378
to this point. So I just don't
feel comfortable with that. But,

513
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:32,429
if I know somebody, if I've --,"
even it -- I would say, there have been

514
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,909
people that I probably haven't
been in the same breakout room

515
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:39,418
with, but I ha -- would still recommend
because I see how they interact

516
00:34:39,423 --> 00:34:43,228
with other people in Slack or
I've heard them talk to other

517
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:46,739
people on a lunch and -- during a
Lunch and Learn and something like

518
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:50,398
that. And I'm like, "Yeah, that
person is awesome." Like, they're

519
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:53,039
really patient, or they're really
knowledgeable, or they're really

520
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,548
great at teaching. And so I feel
comfortable being able to pass

521
00:34:56,548 --> 00:35:00,028
that along. And so, if somebody is
looking and you do have a

522
00:35:00,028 --> 00:35:04,469
connection to a community member
that has a connection, then- then

523
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:07,739
it's okay to reach out to them
and ask them for a

524
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:12,208
recommendation. And I've even had
people in the past, when I was a

525
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:17,083
teacher, say, "I need a
recommendation. Do you -- I wrote

526
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:21,313
it already. Would you send this?"
[Laughs] I'm like, "All right. I'm gonna

527
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:24,614
change it up a little bit to put
it in my voice, but I agree with

528
00:35:24,614 --> 00:35:25,500
everything you've said-

529
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:25,700
Sadie: Yes.

530
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,213
Bekah: -and it makes it easier on
me. So, sure," you know?

530
00:35:28,623 --> 00:35:28,844
Sadie: Yes.

531
00:35:29,773 --> 00:35:31,244
Bekah: I don't think that's
cheating. I think it's just

532
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:33,673
making it a little bit easier.
And if the person feels

533
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,903
comfortable sending it, than they
will.

534
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:38,983
Sadie: Exactly. And like, you can
say what you wanna hype up about

535
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:41,414
yourself and then have someone
co-sign that. So, yeah.

536
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:41,773
Bekah: Yes.

536
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:42,443
Sadie: Absolutely. Mm-hmm.

537
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:46,168
Bekah: Dan, you were
gonna say something and I

538
00:35:46,168 --> 00:35:47,009
interrupted you.

539
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:52,000
Dan: Mm, yeah. What do you think
it was? [Bekah and Sadie laugh]

541
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,543
It was ... oh, no. I was just

540
00:35:55,543 --> 00:35:58,873
gonna talk, like, hhype [??] about
how networking -- you know, like,

541
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:01,514
having a network of people that
you know and could trust is- is

542
00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:04,664
so important with all this stuff,
you know? Cuz it's like that you-

543
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:09,208
you found that reference. And I've
had people both knew they were

544
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,188
hiring and- and asked me, you
know? "Hey, are you looking for --

545
00:36:11,188 --> 00:36:13,918
like, whatever you look for a job,"
or the same way as Bekah, like, "Do

546
00:36:13,918 --> 00:36:16,648
you know anybody that would fit
this role?" Like, "We're been --

547
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:18,000
we're- we're looking to hire
somebody."

548
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,300
Sadie: Mm.

549
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,579
Dan: It's the same kind of thing,

548
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,298
you know? And i-if I ... I love
being able to help people, but I

549
00:36:24,304 --> 00:36:27,148
also, like, I know, like I have --
just having a network, you know?

550
00:36:27,148 --> 00:36:30,500
I have this, like, large safety net
[chuckles], almost, you know, of-

551
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:30,778
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

551
00:36:30,778 --> 00:36:33,389
Dan: -if something fell- fell apart
or whatever, you know? I- I know I

552
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:37,333
have a bunch of people that I can,
like, lean on for help, and support,

553
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:40,664
and stuff, in the future. So --
I dunno. It's- it's cool. It's

554
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:41,143
good stuff.

555
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:41,798
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

556
00:36:41,798 --> 00:36:41,798
Bekah: Yeah.

557
00:36:41,798 --> 00:36:46,273
Dan: I -- all of my job, all --
[chuckles] sorry. So, I'm independent.

558
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:49,700
But all of my, like, clients I've
ever worked for are all word of

559
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,000
mouth, you know?

560
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,200
Sadie: Wow.

561
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,384
Dan: Like, connections of
connections, stuff like that. And

560
00:36:53,384 --> 00:36:57,014
it's always the -- you know, and I-
I work -- I have- I- I have a network

561
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:01,949
of people that do my kind of work
and ... it's always this -- it's

562
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:04,679
always the -- those clients and -- are
always the ones that are, like, the

563
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:05,500
best clients, you know what I
mean?

564
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:05,700
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

565
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,349
Dan: As opposed to, like, the
cold

564
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:10,409
call ones or like where there's
no connection at all before. And

565
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:14,188
that's not to say it can never
work, obviously. But -- a-a-and

566
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:17,128
those- those, like, word of mouth
connections are only come from,

567
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,608
you know, building a, like, I hate
using [laughs], I don't know. The word

568
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:23,518
network is like -- it's got like a
bunch of weird connotations, you

569
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:27,539
know? Cuz there's like a lot
of bad ways to do networking,

570
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,700
you know? [Sadie laughs] Like,
I've never like actively been

00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,958
like, "I'm gonna go

571
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:34,168
network now," you know? But
that's what you end up with, you

572
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,778
know, at different communities and-
and things that -- they really

573
00:37:36,778 --> 00:37:40,679
are in network. It's- it's a good
word that has been poisoned by ...

574
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:43,200
I don't know. Connotations-

575
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,500
Bekah: [Laughs] Bad people.

576
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,028
Dan: -of other- other things.
Yeah. I dunno.

575
00:37:45,568 --> 00:37:49,887
But, anyway, that's all. Just
to say ... I don't know what

576
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:52,700
is to say other than the
community is important [laughs].

577
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,347
Welcome to Virtual Coffee
Community Podcast [laughs].

578
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,038
Bekah: Well, and community is a
great way to gain experience too,

579
00:37:59,038 --> 00:38:01,677
along with connections, you know?
I know there's a bunch of people

580
00:38:01,677 --> 00:38:05,188
that put Virtual Coffee
experience on their resume. I

581
00:38:05,193 --> 00:38:07,978
actually interviewed for a
job a couple of years ago. And

582
00:38:07,978 --> 00:38:10,228
while I was interviewing, they
were like, "Oh, yeah. Somebody else

583
00:38:10,228 --> 00:38:12,538
from Virtual Coffee is
interviewing too. We talked about

584
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:13,800
it in the interview." And I'm
like [Sadie and Dan laugh] -- I

585
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,438
still don't know who that person
is. But

585
00:38:16,438 --> 00:38:21,358
I'm like, "Huh, that's really
interesting." I love it though,

586
00:38:21,362 --> 00:38:23,427
you know? It's great. Like,
everybody is giving back to the

587
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:28,527
community in some way. And like,
if- if the -- their experience

588
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:32,697
doing the support that they do at
Virtual Coffee leads to a job, I

589
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:34,588
love it. I am 100% here for that.

590
00:38:35,538 --> 00:38:35,757
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

591
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,958
Bekah: Now, okay. So you've gone
on all these interviews, you've

592
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:44,487
done all these things. And I --
we- we talked about how tough the

593
00:38:44,577 --> 00:38:48,838
interview scene is in tech. But
are there any, like, good interview

594
00:38:48,842 --> 00:38:51,807
stories that you have or
experiences that you're like,

595
00:38:51,813 --> 00:38:53,878
"Well, I wouldn't mind having that
one again."

596
00:38:54,268 --> 00:39:00,027
Sadie: Right. Yeah. Ooh. I think,
one that stood out to me was -- I

597
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:03,807
think it was a two part. Like,
the first interview was like, me

598
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:08,487
gathering a whole bunch questions.
And the space was set up

599
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:11,668
that, like, "This is your time to
ask us any questions that you

600
00:39:11,668 --> 00:39:16,500
have." And so I was super excited 
[chuckles] about the role on the

601
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:16,947
team. So I

601
00:39:16,947 --> 00:39:22,500
had like a whole list of like 40
questions and put it [laughs] --

602
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:22,858
it's really

602
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:26,788
embarrassing now. But I really --
I- I put it up on GitHub and,

603
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:32,038
like, created a repo of questions
and shared it with them. And

604
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:35,697
they're like, "Oh, this is so cool.
And, like, a little intimidated

605
00:39:35,697 --> 00:39:38,000
now cuz you have all these
questions prepared." [Laughs]

606
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,288
They were like -- but it worked

606
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:44,188
out cuz I- I passed to the next
round. And that next round was to

607
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:48,268
present a project that I had been
working on in -- kinda like talk to

608
00:39:48,268 --> 00:39:53,577
them about, like, the features or
like, why I built it, and have a

609
00:39:53,577 --> 00:39:56,608
discussion on like maybe how it
could be improved, and things like

610
00:39:56,728 --> 00:40:00,972
that. So I thought, like, it was
super collaborative and

611
00:40:00,972 --> 00:40:06,853
like ... I don't wanna say low
stakes, but it changed the ni-

612
00:40:07,123 --> 00:40:10,393
dynamic. Cuz it wasn't like me
getting a take home, and then I

613
00:40:10,398 --> 00:40:13,722
had to get familiar with one of
the directions that they want me

614
00:40:13,722 --> 00:40:16,813
to follow, and then also think of
like, "Okay, how would I do this?"

615
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:20,700
And like -- it like -- it's not
that. But it was a project that

616
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,762
I had made, and

616
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:27,043
like, was excited about, and wanted
to talk to other people about. And I

617
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:30,793
had an opportunity to see how
they would collaborate with me on

618
00:40:30,793 --> 00:40:35,623
projects and like, how they would
give feedback. And -- I don't know.

619
00:40:35,623 --> 00:40:42,822
It just felt like a- a more ...
like big picture view of the

620
00:40:42,822 --> 00:40:46,483
interviewer or- or of me. And so,
yeah, I would totally do that

621
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:48,222
again. Like, if all interviews
could be like that [laughs].

622
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:53,458
Dan: That's really cool. So, they
were -- so it was to present some --

623
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,500
just any random project that you
had been working on-

624
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:55,700
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

625
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,637
Dan: -personally? Yeah, yeah.

00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:56,800
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

624
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,000
Dan: That's awesome. I love that
idea.

625
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,500
Sadie: Yeah. Me too.

626
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,297
Dan: Cuz it gives you -- yeah.
It takes all the

625
00:41:00,297 --> 00:41:03,358
pressure off of the, like,
learning some unfamiliar thing

626
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,588
and -- but you can still see --
having to present it like that

627
00:41:07,588 --> 00:41:11,500
lets you sort of show off how,
you know [chuckles], much you

628
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,373
know, or what,

628
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:14,262
like, the kinds of things you
think about that, your thinking

629
00:41:14,262 --> 00:41:16,422
process is, which is the kind of
stuff that you really wanna know

630
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:17,000
when you're interviewing.

631
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,300
Sadie: Exactly.

632
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,083
Dan: Anyway, as like an
interviewer, you don't

631
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:23,563
wanna know -- I mean, I've
personally like -- it's like, okay.

632
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:25,902
There's like different skill
levels. People might -- like,

633
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,092
nobody knows everything. People
might have holes in their

634
00:41:28,092 --> 00:41:31,932
knowledge. But the thing that
you're always looking for is-

635
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:36,313
is like, the ability to like
think through problems and, you

636
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:42,657
know, sort of be able to
constructively, like, talk about

637
00:41:42,657 --> 00:41:44,500
things, right? [Dan and Sadie
laugh] And- and if you're talking

00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,327
about your own work, then

638
00:41:45,327 --> 00:41:47,188
you don't have to -- you know,
then you don't have the whole

639
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:49,677
step of like, learning what it
was and trying to guess what they

640
00:41:49,677 --> 00:41:50,000
were thinking or all of that-

641
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,300
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

642
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,239
Dan: -stuff, right? You
know- you know what you were

641
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:53,300
thinking [laughs], right?

642
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:53,500
Sadie: Exactly.

643
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,947
Dan: Or like, maybe
you know, but maybe you remember

642
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:57,000
what you were thinking, but --

643
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:57,500
Sadie: Exactly.

644
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,588
Dan: I like -- that's a great
idea. I

643
00:41:58,588 --> 00:42:02,668
like- I like that. I- I don't
think I'm ever gonna hire

644
00:42:02,668 --> 00:42:05,608
anybody, but I- I always like --
I love when I hear about things

645
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:08,007
like that. That are like a little
bit different than everybody, you

646
00:42:08,007 --> 00:42:11,847
know, than- than the usual thing.
And I take notes of 'em,

647
00:42:11,847 --> 00:42:17,789
but ... yeah. That's nice.
That's a cool one. Okay. So you

648
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:20,730
said -- I'm gonna jump all the way
to the now times. You said you

649
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:24,449
work for a federal agency and you
do front-end development. That -- I

650
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:27,599
think that's really interesting.
So are there -- well, I guess my

651
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,909
question is like, can you -- are
you able to talk a little bit

652
00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:33,329
about what that's like? Like,
working in a government agency,

653
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:36,644
especially doing front end stuff? I-
I mean, I -- that makes me think of,

654
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:39,135
like, rules and, you know,
oh, you have to like a bunch of

655
00:42:39,135 --> 00:42:40,815
regulations you have to follow or
something like that. And maybe

656
00:42:40,815 --> 00:42:40,700
that's not-

657
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,000
Bekah: [Unintelligible] and
aliens [chuckles]?

658
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:44,894
Dan: -the case, but like I -- [laughs]
or, yeah. Or Bekah is gonna- gonna

657
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,014
call DARPA and, you know, get the
aliens coming. But I just

658
00:42:48,014 --> 00:42:49,105
like would like to hear about
it. I'm just curious.

659
00:42:49,514 --> 00:42:53,505
Sadie: Yeah. That's- that's --
yeah. Yeah. So I just started in

660
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:57,255
April. So I'm still trying to
wrap up, like, what can I do and

661
00:42:57,255 --> 00:43:03,251
what can't I do? But from my
understanding, that all federal

662
00:43:03,251 --> 00:43:06,641
websites need to follow a set of
standards called the US web

663
00:43:06,641 --> 00:43:13,152
design standard. And it's something
that's created by, I believe by

664
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:23,081
18F? They are like another, like,
kinda like agency — not like

665
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:28,632
agency, like, big agency — but
like, they create the standards for

666
00:43:28,722 --> 00:43:32,411
websites across federal agencies,
if I understand correctly. But

667
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:36,777
anyways, the US Web Design System, it's
kind of like- kind of like

668
00:43:36,777 --> 00:43:40,737
Bootstrap where you put your
classes into the HTML to make

669
00:43:40,737 --> 00:43:44,606
sure that the website is
accessible. So, like, button sizes,

670
00:43:44,606 --> 00:43:48,266
and like screen sizes, and media
queries, and things like that are

671
00:43:48,266 --> 00:43:51,626
all sort of set by these
standards, and you just kind of

672
00:43:51,626 --> 00:43:57,117
drop it into the HTML. Yeah.
I'm still trying to learn that,

673
00:43:57,476 --> 00:44:04,827
but ... yeah. Outside of that, like,
I- I haven't played too much outside of

674
00:44:04,827 --> 00:44:08,697
that. And like, tried to really
customize the website per se,

675
00:44:08,757 --> 00:44:15,117
because I inherited this-
this website and the properties

676
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:20,336
for the- for the agency. And so I
don't have the really built out

677
00:44:20,336 --> 00:44:22,000
too much, like, by hand.

678
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:22,700
Dan: Right.

679
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,481
Sadie: Which is ... good and bad?
[Laughs] But --

678
00:44:26,952 --> 00:44:28,632
Dan: Well, I mean, like, over time
you'll -- yeah.

679
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:33,132
Sadie: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It'll
take some time. But, yeah. That --

680
00:44:33,132 --> 00:44:36,371
that's what I'm finding most
interesting. It seems like

681
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:41,532
Jekyll is very favored. And
also, a-all of -- not all. But a

682
00:44:41,532 --> 00:44:46,271
lot of the websites are on
GitHub. So you can actually see,

683
00:44:46,302 --> 00:44:50,021
like, how these sites are built.
And if you want to, like, poke

684
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,056
around, like, it's all there.
Yeah.

685
00:44:53,487 --> 00:44:54,327
Dan: Nice. That's cool.

686
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:57,416
Sadie: Yeah [laughs]. Yeah. Yeah.

688
00:44:58,211 --> 00:45:00,371
Bekah: So you -- you're using a lot
of Jekyll? Is that what you said?

689
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:02,126
Sadie: Yeah. It's Jekyll. Yeah
[laughs].

690
00:45:02,552 --> 00:45:02,972
Bekah: That's interesting.

691
00:45:03,936 --> 00:45:04,226
Sadie: Yeah.

692
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:10,481
Bekah: I -- both of my blogs are
using Jekyll because I'm not really

693
00:45:10,481 --> 00:45:13,500
even sure [chuckles] that's the
direction I went when I first

694
000:45:13,500 --> 0:45:13,871
started. And so

694
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:18,382
I just kept going with it. And I
feel like Jekyll — this is a Jekyll

695
00:45:18,402 --> 00:45:21,581
tangent — I love using Jekyll, but
I feel like their documentation

696
00:45:21,581 --> 00:45:22,500
is terrible.

697
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,000
Sadie: Mm. Mm-hmm.

698
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,711
Bekah: And I keep hearing
people that love Jekyll they're

697
00:45:25,711 --> 00:45:28,211
like, "But their community is
great. So you can ask lots of

698
00:45:28,211 --> 00:45:31,300
questions and they'll get
answered." But I- I just want to

00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,512
read it in the

699
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:35,700
documentation. Just, like, explain
this to me.

700
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,000
Sadie: [Laughs] Right.

701
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,581
Bekah: But also, I've never, like,

700
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:40,942
contributed to their documentation.
So, that's also ...

701
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:44,092
something I should probably do
instead of complaining about it [laughs].

702
00:45:45,146 --> 00:45:48,567
Sadie: I hear that [laughs].
Yeah. I feel that.

703
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:49,481
Dan: You can complain once in
a while.

704
00:45:51,442 --> 00:45:53,032
Bekah: That's it. I'm done my
Jekyll rant. Sorry.

705
00:45:54,472 --> 00:45:56,512
Dan: Oh, man. I- I just -- that's
very interesting. I mean, I've

706
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:59,362
done -- I've concentrated on the
front end for, you know, my whole

707
00:45:59,367 --> 00:46:03,411
career. And so -- but I've never
worked with anything, you know,

708
00:46:03,442 --> 00:46:07,652
that have any external standards
that anybody's looking at in the-

709
00:46:07,652 --> 00:46:10,702
in the code. You know what I mean?
You -- we try to, like, be ex- as,

710
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:13,251
like, accessible as possible and every-
you know, all that stuff, but

711
00:46:13,251 --> 00:46:18,291
it's always just me that's doing
those and en-enforcing it on myself

712
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:20,362
or whatever, you know, or- or any
teammates that I'm working with.

713
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:23,271
But it- it's never coming down
from above, you know what I mean?

714
00:46:23,271 --> 00:46:23,391
Sadie: Mm.

714
00:46:23,391 --> 00:46:26,092
Dan: And so, that's- that's, like,
gotta be in- a really interesting

715
00:46:26,092 --> 00:46:29,300
experience to be in that
role-

716
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:29,500
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

717
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,791
Dan: -you know? And ... that's

716
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:34,161
awesome that they're -- that
they are doing to open source

717
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:35,902
stuff. That's really cool.

718
00:46:36,262 --> 00:46:40,222
Sadie: Yes. Yeah. There's a lot of
open source of projects from the

719
00:46:40,222 --> 00:46:40,672
government [chuckles].

720
00:46:41,512 --> 00:46:44,092
Dan: That's awesome. Yeah. That-
that makes me, like, wonder. Yeah,

721
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:47,000
just now [laughs] -- you know, I-
I always just assume that it's

722
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,452
all, like, locked

722
00:46:47,452 --> 00:46:50,000
down, and it's all, whatever --
super-

723
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,300
Bekah: DARPA?

724
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,342
Dan: -custom, you know, DARPA-

723
00:46:52,431 --> 00:46:56,422
DARPA static sites. But no, they're
just open source season [??]

724
00:46:57,262 --> 00:46:57,442
[unintelligible]. That's awesome.

725
00:46:57,672 --> 00:46:58,161
Sadie: [Laughs] Exactly.

726
00:46:58,311 --> 00:47:02,500
Dan: That's so cool [laughs]. Yeah.
Mm. That's cool. Thank you for

727
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,302
sharing about that. That --

727
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,681
I find that really interesting.

728
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,300
Sadie: Yeah.

728
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:07,936
Bekah: Where -- what do you like
best about your job?

729
00:47:08,822 --> 00:47:12,632
Sadie: Oh, that's a good
question. I don't know. I feel

730
00:47:12,632 --> 00:47:16,981
like I'm- I'm gonna get kind of
meta. But that I am at a federal

731
00:47:17,192 --> 00:47:21,271
agency [laughs], it feels like
it completes, like, a cycle or

732
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:26,371
something, because my grandmother
and my grandfather were both in

733
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:32,731
the army. And my uncles were in,
like, the army and marines. My mom

734
00:47:32,731 --> 00:47:36,931
retired military, like, retired
air force. And so I grew up in

735
00:47:36,931 --> 00:47:41,822
the military family and always
like, had that, like, "Ooh, am I

736
00:47:41,827 --> 00:47:45,902
gonna join the military or not?"
Or, "Am I gonna be, like [chuckles],

737
00:47:45,902 --> 00:47:48,961
a contractor or something?" And I
always felt like, "Nah, that's not

738
00:47:48,961 --> 00:47:52,501
for me. Nah, that's not- that's
not what I'm gonna do." And I'm

739
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:58,771
here. Like, I'm- I'm a contractor
now. Like [laughs] -- so, it's

740
00:47:59,282 --> 00:48:01,592
just like, "Oh, wow." Like, "A
family cycles are- are a thing."

741
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:05,000
Bekah: That's such a great story.

742
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,300
Sadie: Thank you [laughs].

743
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:05,500
Dan: Yeah, it's really cool.

744
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,500
Bekah: I loved that.

742
00:48:06,871 --> 00:48:12,811
Sadie: Yeah. Yeah. It's so funny.
Yeah. Like ... yeah, my mom

743
00:48:12,811 --> 00:48:20,282
retired, like, two months out from my
18th birthday. So like, it's, like, the

744
00:48:20,282 --> 00:48:24,871
military and, like, that connection
is just like a part of my

745
00:48:24,876 --> 00:48:27,842
identity. And like, I feel like
that's something that, like, not

746
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:32,251
too many people know. It's like,
I -- like, I'm- I'm, like, looking

747
00:48:32,251 --> 00:48:34,561
around right now — you can't see
this — but, like, where I am right

748
00:48:34,561 --> 00:48:39,001
now, I grew up actually on the
military base. Like, that's

749
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:42,751
probably, like, five miles away
from my house. And, I don't know.

750
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:46,771
It was just a lot of like, "Wow,"
like- like, I've always been

751
00:48:46,771 --> 00:48:51,931
aware of contractors and like ...
just that relationship, but just

752
00:48:52,442 --> 00:48:55,831
now being on the other side and
saying like, "Oh," like, "Huh, this

753
00:48:55,831 --> 00:48:58,981
is how- this is how it works." And
like, I can also see, like, how

754
00:48:58,981 --> 00:49:02,791
intense it is to be in the
military and like the- the sort

755
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:08,192
of, like, expectations you have to
fulfill that role. Like- like, I

756
00:49:08,192 --> 00:49:12,181
came into this job thinking like,
"Oh," like, "Now I can't, like,

757
00:49:13,382 --> 00:49:16,000
[chuckles] be late for my job. Or
I can't, like, take- [chuckles]

758
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,092
take off work." Because

758
00:49:18,092 --> 00:49:25,081
that's what I saw my mom, like,
having to, like ... I guess

759
00:49:25,081 --> 00:49:29,192
fulfill or, like, be secure in her
job, but that's -- it's not like

760
00:49:29,192 --> 00:49:33,601
that at all. Like, I- I have a
wonderful team that, like, respects

761
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:37,561
work life balance and like, people
have kids, and like, they

762
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:40,862
understand, like, you know,
today's not the day, like, just

763
00:49:40,862 --> 00:49:45,302
come back tomorrow, and it'll be
okay. Like, that sort of thing. So,

764
00:49:45,306 --> 00:49:51,152
yeah. It- it's a -- it's really deep.
But, yeah. That's my answer [chuckles].

765
00:49:53,266 --> 00:49:55,577
Bekah: I like that. I mean,
there's- there's familiarity

766
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:58,786
there, right? And then there's
comfort that comes with that. And

767
00:49:59,086 --> 00:50:02,936
when you're talking about taking
on a new job, it's really nice to

768
00:50:02,936 --> 00:50:05,686
be able to have something like
that, where you can feel

769
00:50:05,686 --> 00:50:07,547
comfortable in some aspect of
what you're doing.

770
00:50:08,251 --> 00:50:11,311
Sadie: Right. Exactly. Exactly.

771
00:50:14,086 --> 00:50:18,047
Bekah: Well, we're at just about
time here. Is- is there any last

772
00:50:18,047 --> 00:50:22,217
piece of advice you have for our
listeners who are prepping for

773
00:50:22,277 --> 00:50:26,117
interviews or leaving bootcamps
and about to discover the next

774
00:50:26,117 --> 00:50:27,047
stage of their journey?

775
00:50:27,467 --> 00:50:33,300
Sadie: Ooh, that's -- okay. I
could say so much. But [laughs]

776
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:33,646
I hate to

776
00:50:33,646 --> 00:50:37,157
say, like, something trite, but
like, also, like, one, trust

777
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:42,436
process. And then two, you know
more than you think. Like, for

778
00:50:42,436 --> 00:50:45,677
example, I didn't know Jekyll at
all when I was interviewing for

779
00:50:45,677 --> 00:50:50,911
this job. But, one, I reached out
to my community. So, if you need a

780
00:50:50,911 --> 00:50:55,442
community, find your community.
VC's here, but there's also

781
00:50:55,442 --> 00:51:00,121
others. And then two, like, do
what you can, explain what you-

782
00:51:00,302 --> 00:51:03,121
what you did and, like, your
thought processes. And if it's

783
00:51:03,121 --> 00:51:06,302
not the fit, it's not a fit. But
you will find your job and you

784
00:51:06,302 --> 00:51:06,661
can do it.

785
00:51:07,021 --> 00:51:08,552
Dan: I love that. Trust the
process.

787
00:51:10,262 --> 00:51:12,552
Bekah: Yeah, I love that. Thanks
so much, Sadie, for being here

788
00:51:12,811 --> 00:51:15,661
with us today. We've grabbed all
the links for the stuff that you

789

00:51:18,722 --> 00:51:22,862
preparation advice, and we'll put
those in the show notes. And so

791
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:23,431
thanks for being here.

792
00:51:23,851 --> 00:51:24,500
Sadie: Yay. Thank you.
