00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:08,016
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 6, Episode 4

2
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:09,516
of

3
00:00:09,516 --> 00:00:12,365
the Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

4
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:15,214
that

5
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:18,693
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

6
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:20,043
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

7
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:21,393
their

8
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:24,094
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

9
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:25,656
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

10
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:27,213
it with

11
00:00:27,213 --> 00:00:30,814
you. Here with me today is my
cohost, Dan.

12
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:35,914
Dan Ott: Wuddup, Bek? [Bekah and
Dan laugh] Ho-how's it going?

13
00:00:36,844 --> 00:00:38,433
Bekah: It- it's going
wonderfully [laughs].

14
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:45,694
Dan: Excellent. Today we are
talking with Sadie Jay who is a

15
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:48,993
front-end developer with a
federal agency. We talked about

16
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:51,653
her long experience doing the
interview process, and, yeah.

17
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:54,313
And

18
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:56,834
her experience working at a- at
a government agency as well.

19
00:00:56,954 --> 00:01:00,179
Bekah: Yeah, it was really
interesting to hear how she kind

20
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:02,353
of started in tech. She burnt
out, and left tech for a while,

21
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,527
and

22
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:08,278
then decided to give it a second
shot, and she's back doing it

23
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:11,308
again. And it sounds like she's
really excited. But also like,

24
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:14,444
took those lessons that she
learned from that burnout

25
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:18,284
experience and brought them with
her so she doesn't get burnout

26
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:19,813
again. And I think that's
really, really useful because I

27
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,342
see that

28
00:01:21,343 --> 00:01:22,513
happen to a lot of people.

29
00:01:23,364 --> 00:01:24,709
Dan: Yeah, totally. I -- it was-
it was interesting hearing her

30
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,054
talk

31
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:29,864
about her thought process, you
know, when she was

32
00:01:29,864 --> 00:01:34,903
experiencing the burnout stuff
and- and just taking a break

33
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:38,114
like that, you know, and- and
dealing with it head on. I

34
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:39,239
think it was- it was really
cool. And I think there's a lot

35
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,364
of valuable

36
00:01:40,364 --> 00:01:41,084
stuff in there.

37
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:44,914
Bekah: Yep. And we start every
episode of the podcast like we

38
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:48,243
start every Virtual Coffee. We
introduce ourselves with our

39
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:51,993
name, where we're from, what we
do, and a random check-in

40
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:58,131
question. And we hope you enjoy
this episode. Hi, I'm Bekah. I

41
00:01:58,131 --> 00:02:04,208
am

42
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:07,254
a technical community builder
from a small town in Ohio. And

43
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:10,299
an

44
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,166
imaginary class that I wish was
offered. I feel like this is

45
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,028
hard

46
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:21,748
because I'm not sure what would
be practical for an imaginary

47
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:29,218
class. And maybe imaginary
classes aren't practical?

48
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:30,886
Dan: Did the imaginary class
teach imaginary things? Or is

49
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:32,299
this like

50
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,193
a chance to learn, you know?

51
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:35,100
Bekah: Oh, for sure. It can
teach-

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,500
Dan: Magic or whatever? Mm.

53
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,299
Bekah: -imaginary things. Yeah,
I think I

54
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:47,618
would like to definitely take a
class that watches people

55
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:54,633
have brain scans. And that's not
an imaginary class. I'm kind of

56
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,378
like neurobiology class. But
there's [laughs] gotta be some

57
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:00,123
kind of

58
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:06,041
imaginary aspect to brain scans
and ... people. I'm really bad

59
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:11,508
at this

60
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:13,503
question [Dan laughs]. I was the
one that chose it too. So I'd

61
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:15,498
just like

62
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:19,218
makes it worse. I'm just gonna
like look at people's

63
00:03:19,218 --> 00:03:24,408
brains and see what they do.
That's it. It's not imaginary.

64
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:26,658
It's wishful. That's what I
wish. I wish to watch people's

65
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:28,248
brains.

66
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:31,739
Dan: Less of a class and more of
a profession you wish you had?

67
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:35,108
Bekah: [Laughs] Yes, I would
love to be a neurobiologist.

68
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:37,218
That would be

69
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:41,989
fantastic. What? Okay. Maybe an
imaginary class on like studying

70
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,408
black holes by like actually
physically exploring them. Cuz

71
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:46,800
that's not possible.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,200
Dan: Mm.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,568
Bekah: So, is that better?

74
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:52,734
Dan: I don't know [laughs]. I
don't know what to do with this

75
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:54,079
question.

76
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:59,239
Hi, I'm Dan. I do computer
development things in

77
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:03,378
Cleveland, and, yeah. Imaginary
class. I have no -- I

78
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:05,823
mean, I don't really understand
this question [laughs] to tell

79
00:04:05,823 --> 00:04:08,268
you the truth.

80
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:14,239
I- I don't know. I guess I'm
gonna go with ... like

81
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,773
spaceship flying? Yeah. But,
like, not the boring ones that

82
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:19,277
we have

83
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:21,319
in the reality though, you know?
Or like "Star Wars".

84
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:22,038
Bekah: "Star Wars" spaceship
flying?

85
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:23,538
Dan: Like -- yeah, yeah. Like
teach me how to fly the-

86
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:24,918
Bekah: That's a good imaginary
class.

87
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:26,569
Dan: -the Millennium Falcon or
something, you know? That'd be

88
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:26,778
cool.

89
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,218
Bekah: Yeah, that's what I --
oh, yeah.

90
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:29,703
Dan: As long as I actually got
to fly it. Yeah. All right.

91
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,157
That's gonna

92
00:04:31,158 --> 00:04:31,728
be my answer [laughs].

93
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:38,014
Sadie Jay: Okay. Hi, I'm Sadie.
I'm from a small town in the

94
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:40,264
Panhandle, Florida. I am a
front-end developer for a

95
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:42,514
federal

96
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:49,774
agency. And ... an- an imaginary
class. I think I would take -- I

97
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:52,863
don't know. I -- this makes me
think of like when I was in

98
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,244
elementary school and like super
obsessed with like ESP and like

99
00:04:57,274 --> 00:05:01,744
being psychic and things like
that. So I would probably pick

100
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:02,703
some class that develops like
your psychic abilities. I don't

101
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:03,662
know.

102
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:06,319
Bekah: I think-

103
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:06,619
Dan: I like that.

104
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:09,798
Bekah: -that is a good -- an
excellent answer. You have

105
00:05:09,803 --> 00:05:13,769
definitely won this round of
intro questions [laughs].

106
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:16,000
Sadie: [Laughs] Thank you.

107
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:19,428
Dan: Yeah. My first answer was
gonna be like, learn, you know,

108
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:20,569
learn the Force, you know?

109
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:21,163
Sadie: Ooh.

110
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:23,000
Bekah: Mm. That's a good one.

111
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:24,319
Dan: Then I was thinking about
spaceships would be fun too, so

112
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,194
-- and a little more practical.
I was worried that -- I think

113
00:05:26,194 --> 00:05:27,949
that,

114
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:28,500
canonically-

115
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:28,700
Bekah: How will you --

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,778
Dan: -you have to, like, have
the -- be able to use

117
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:33,789
the force to learn -- like in
the net -- it's not like

118
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:35,119
everybody can learn it,

119
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,559
you know? It would be a bummer
to sign up for that class, and

120
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,999
make

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,329
it there, and

122
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:39,000
then you find out you-

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Sadie: Can't work it. You aren't
eligible [laughs].

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,033
Dan: -can't- can't -- right.
Like [laughs] --

125
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:45,064
Bekah: You can watch everybody
else use the Force, but you're

126
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:45,334
stuck.

127
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:46,000
Dan: Right. Right, right.

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Sadie: You miss the
[unintelligible] [laughs].

129
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,468
Dan: It's not like everybody can
use a --

130
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:51,108
everybody could use a- a -- or
learn how to fly spaceships.

131
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:52,894
Bekah: I feel like I want a
class on communicating with

132
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,139
aliens, but

133
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:55,894
I feel like DARPA already has
that or something like -- it's

134
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:57,649
out

135
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,215
there. We just don't know about
it yet [laughs]. Well, welcome

136
00:06:00,215 --> 00:06:02,781
Sadie.

137
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:06,122
Thanks for being here with us
today. We're very, very excited

138
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:10,041
to have you. and we always like
to start off with your tech

139
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:11,917
origin stories. So how did you
get to this point in your tech

140
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:13,762
journey?

141
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:21,516
Sadie: Oh, wow. Yeah. That's ...
a good question. I feel like it

142
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:25,956
was a winding journey for sure.
Like, I- I didn't really grow

143
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:32,137
up with a desire to be in tech.
Like. my household computer

144
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,406
was just the computer that let
me get on cartoonnetwork.com and

145
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:41,797
play games. Like, it wasn't much
past that. But I would say,

146
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:48,276
right after I graduated with my
bachelor's degree in

147
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:53,932
psychology, I got into drawing
and painting. Like, and this was

148
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:55,522
just like a random desire that I
had. I was like, "Ah, I just

149
00:06:55,522 --> 00:06:57,112
wanna

150
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:59,751
learn painting. I'm just gonna
take a class." So I did

151
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:02,390
[chuckles]. And, like,

152
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:04,854
fell in love. And from that I
wanted to like find a career

153
00:07:04,854 --> 00:07:07,312
that

154
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:09,729
let me combine psychology and,
like, drawing or visual arts. So

155
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,141
I

156
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,046
was like, "Okay, maybe web
design somehow? Cuz that would

157
00:07:14,046 --> 00:07:15,951
also let

158
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:18,571
me work remotely and give me
some flexibility." So I went to

159
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,191
a bootcamp.

160
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:25,927
I went to Skillcrush and signed
up for one of their

161
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:27,441
courses. It was like a web
design course or visual design

162
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:28,955
course.

163
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:32,601
This was back in like 2017 ...
like, several years ago. But I

164
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:36,186
wanted

165
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:37,432
to, like, test out the waters to
see if that was something I

166
00:07:37,432 --> 00:07:38,677
would

167
00:07:38,682 --> 00:07:41,409
be interested in. And, like, it-
it seemed good enough. Like, I-

168
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:44,136
I

169
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:47,317
felt like I could do it. So then
I signed up for my master -- my

170
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:52,101
master's, specializing in web
design and online communication.

171
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:57,081
And in that program, like, we
did both web design and also web

172
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:01,072
development. And I realized that
like, actually web development

173
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:03,983
was more my thing and not so
much the web design. So, yeah.

174
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,890
So

175
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:11,122
that was like the really -- the
kickoff to my tech journey, for

176
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:13,236
sure. But after I graduated, I
-- there was another pivot.

177
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:15,350
Like, I

178
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:18,231
was completely burnt out on tech
and anything tech related. Like,

179
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,316
I

180
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:22,641
couldn't bear to think about
like coding. And I remember like

181
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:24,965
I

182
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:29,257
applied to some internship and
got a LeetCode challenge, but at

183
00:08:29,257 --> 00:08:32,736
the time I didn't know what that
was. So I was like, "Oh, wow. I

184
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:34,089
just graduated with this
degree," and like, "I can't even

185
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,437
use it."

186
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:37,956
Like, I don't know what, like,
how to do this thing with

187
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:40,206
JavaScript

188
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:42,156
that they want me to do. So it
just completely, like,

189
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:44,106
demoralized

190
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:48,621
me and like crushed my
confidence. So I became a yoga

191
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:50,661
teacher. I was out in Brooklyn
and doing that, like, yoga life

192
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:52,701
and-

193
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:53,152
Bekah: Awesome.

194
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:56,500
Sadie: -like [chuckles] meeting
with cool people. And then I

195
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,231
got into the travel

196
00:08:57,231 --> 00:08:59,961
industry and did that for a
year. But all of that ended

197
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:02,691
around 2020

198
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:04,942
when I left the job, and then
the pandemic started, and all

199
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:07,192
that. So

200
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:10,139
it gave me time to reflect. And
I had to move back home after

201
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:13,086
being

202
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,267
in Brooklyn for a few years. And
I really thought, I was like,

203
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:18,381
"Okay, what am I gonna do next?"
Cuz, like, I don't want to be

204
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:20,495
here,

205
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,736
like Florida, which is home for
me. Like, I don't wanna be here

206
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:25,509
forever, but I do wanna take the
time to, like, make sure that,

207
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:27,277
like,

208
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:33,547
I'm going in a direction that I
feel good about and kind of came

209
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:37,117
to the conclusion that, like, I
didn't really give tech a try.

210
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:40,687
Like, I-

211
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:45,547
I let the burnout, like, kind of
like take over. I don't know. I

212
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:48,982
guess, like, my direction or
just like ... I dunno, just had

213
00:09:48,982 --> 00:09:52,417
me stopping

214
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,996
my tracks. So I was like, "You
know what? I'm gonna give this a

215
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:59,647
college try," like, "Imma- imma
do this again." And this

216
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:03,547
time I'm going to make sure I
have community around me. And

217
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:05,729
that's how I found y'all, I
found Virtual Coffee. So I

218
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:07,911
restarted my

219
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:11,631
bootcamp, restarted Skillcrush,
and did the front-end developer

220
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:15,892
intensive. But this time, I was
very intentional about joining

221
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:17,767
community, like being very
active in Virtual Coffee, and I

222
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,642
wanted

223
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:23,991
to do the open source thing. So
it would just so happen that

224
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:28,096
the kickoff for the
Hacktoberfest month was like a

225
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:31,971
week or two

226
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:34,807
away. So that's when I joined
Virtual Coffee. I got to sit in

227
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:36,607
and watch Dan do the -- like,
how to contribute to open

228
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:38,407
source.

229
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:41,000
And, yeah. So it- it all just
went from there.

230
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,000
Dan: Awesome.

231
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,376
Sadie: [Chuckles] Yeah, so I
ended

232
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:46,011
up like contributing to like
five projects and like, I

233
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:47,646
contributed

234
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,976
to a couple of IBM projects. I
got to do a demo day with them.

235
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:58,537
And then, started the job search
or -- in, like, February? And

236
00:10:58,956 --> 00:11:00,696
that was another beast of its
own where it took like nine

237
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:02,436
weeks.

238
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:05,797
And just hundreds of
applications to get this job

239
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:08,317
that I have now.

240
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:10,927
Yeah. That's how I got here.
Yeah [laughs].

241
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,000
Dan: I mean, that --

242
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:17,692
Bekah: That's awesome. I love
that story. I -- there's just --

243
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:21,576
I like that you have gone
through a lot of different,

244
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:24,740
like,

245
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:28,000
different journeys on this
journey here, right?

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,312
Sadie: Absolutely.

247
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,857
Bekah: You've done a lot of
different things, but also,

248
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,402
like, coming back from

249
00:11:31,402 --> 00:11:35,932
burnout. I imagine that's gotta
be kind of a hard decision to

250
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:41,782
make. What really kind of pushed
you in that directions? Like,

251
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:44,331
"Okay, fine. I'm gonna do this
one more time."

252
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:47,691
Sadie: Right. That's- that's a
good question. I think, one,

253
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:49,791
time.

254
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:52,806
Time helped. Cuz I had graduated
2018 and then I felt like I

255
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:55,700
could

256
00:11:55,701 --> 00:12:00,000
entertain the thought of tech
again, like, what? A few years

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,532
later? So,

258
00:12:00,532 --> 00:12:03,472
2021? So, really, it was just
time and space that helped, I

259
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,412
would

260
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:11,721
say for the most part. But also,
I don't know. I know, like, I

261
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:16,042
wanted flexibility in my job and
like, where I worked. Like, that

262
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:17,977
was also the catalyst of going
into the master's degree

263
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:19,912
program.

264
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:22,056
So, like, I think that thread
just continued. And I was like,

265
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:24,200
"Okay, I

266
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:28,672
think I could do tech again."
Because I've tried, like, also

267
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:31,942
tried writing on the side a
little bit, but that didn't feel

268
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:38,841
quite as a fit. So I think just
... I dunno. The reflection and

269
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:43,522
wanting to like challenge myself
and see something to completion

270
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:44,392
also helped.

271
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:48,703
Dan: Can you talk a little bit
about your experience?

272
00:12:48,823 --> 00:12:51,028
So, if I have this right, you
did a -- the bootcamp, and then

273
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:53,233
you went to

274
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:54,500
a master's program after that?

275
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:54,800
Sadie: Mm-hmm. I did, yeah.

276
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,803
Dan: So, that's like a lot of
school, like, [laughs]

277
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:58,456
in all together. Can you talk a
little -- I- I don't think I've

278
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:00,104
actually -- we've

279
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:03,923
talked to anybody who is learn
web design stuff or web

280
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:07,524
development stuff in a master's
program. Could you -- would you

281
00:13:07,524 --> 00:13:09,300
mind sharing a little bit about
what that was like?

282
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Sadie: Sure. Yeah.

283
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,033
Dan: And- and,

284
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,283
especially, like, compared to --
since you did it right after the

285
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:16,823
bootcamp, maybe- maybe compared
to what- what it was like-

286
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:17,004
Sadie: Right.

287
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,098
Dan: -yep. Yeah, you know, the
different approaches and

288
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,192
everything.

289
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:21,863
Sadie: Yeah. So, okay. So I did
the bootcamp. And I- I don't

290
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:24,202
even

291
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:28,313
can know if I completed the
course, like, before I did the

292
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:31,464
master's. Like, it was just
enough to be like, "Okay, this

293
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:35,994
seems like something I could
do." So I went into my master's

294
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:40,673
program without any knowledge of
code or anything. But that was

295
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:44,604
the -- like the setup for the
degree. Like, you didn't have to

296
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:50,364
have any prior knowledge. But, I
don't know. I don't -- I kind of

297
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:53,611
don't know how to, like, give
more details, cuz it was -- it-

298
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:56,858
it -- like

299
00:13:56,859 --> 00:14:03,188
college. Like you -- like, we
had four classes a semester.

300
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:05,033
That's what I signed up for.
And, like, the very first class

301
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:06,878
was

302
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:09,971
like a web design principles,
and like, it went into HTML, and

303
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:13,058
maybe

304
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:15,639
a little bit of CSS, and I don't
even think we touched JavaScript

305
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,596
that much in that first class.
And then it built up from there.

306
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:19,553
We

307
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:21,308
learned like -- it was mostly
DOM manipulation. Cuz it- it

308
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:23,063
wasn't

309
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,118
like a computer science class,
so we didn't learn, like,

310
00:14:25,118 --> 00:14:27,173
algorithms

311
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:30,293
or data structures or anything
like that. But basically, like,

312
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:33,295
how to create websites, and,
like, webpages with an eye for

313
00:14:33,295 --> 00:14:36,292
design.

314
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:44,514
We also learn like Adobe Suite,
and social media, and

315
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:46,666
like, analytics for websites,
and things like that. Like, the

316
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,818
capstone

317
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:52,448
project was to create a
WordPress site for a local

318
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:56,078
company. And our

319
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,733
cohort was divided up into
teams. And that was like -- that

320
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:01,388
was

321
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:06,519
the peak, like the end of the
program. But I say all that to

322
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:09,429
say, like -- so, I did that,
finished in 2018, and then went

323
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:12,339
back into

324
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:19,719
the bootcamp 2021. And I- I feel
like I retained enough

325
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:23,408
information, but it was enough
to know that like, "Oh, yeah. I

326
00:15:23,408 --> 00:15:26,723
remember learning that in
school." So I felt like what I

327
00:15:26,723 --> 00:15:30,038
learned in

328
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:31,688
the bootcamp and what I learned
in school were comparable, but

329
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:33,338
it

330
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,438
was just that I had more time in
school to learn the things and

331
00:15:35,438 --> 00:15:37,537
to

332
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:42,639
like, kinda like, dive into each
thing that was taught, like each

333
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:45,346
aspect of HTML or CSS or
JavaScript. Whereas the bootcamp

334
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:47,963
was like,

335
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:52,163
basically, the same topics but
just in a more condensed

336
00:15:52,224 --> 00:15:57,894
time space even though it was
self-paced. So, yeah. It was

337
00:15:57,894 --> 00:15:58,524
really interesting.

338
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,683
Dan: Yeah, I guess it makes
sense.

339
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,744
Bekah: So, the -- so, after you
did the master's program, then

340
00:16:03,744 --> 00:16:06,129
you went

341
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:11,198
into the bootcamp, was there any
interview prep that you did

342
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,088
as part of the master's program
or was that -- did you do that

343
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:14,738
in

344
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:14,918
the [laughs] -- you face it.
[Laughs] No.

345
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:19,824
Sadie: [Laughs] Yeah, no. For
the master's program absolutely

346
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:23,649
not.

347
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:27,759
And I feel like that's why,
like, I was so blindsided by the

348
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:35,048
LeetCode challenge, but, yeah.
What -- the- the, like, real

349
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:40,239
world aspect of the bootcamp --
oh, not the bootcamp. Of the

350
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:43,568
master's degree was like a
internship. So I did an

351
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:48,698
internship at American Document
POV, a media company.

352
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:51,383
And I'm- I'm smiling because
like, I don't -- y'all can't see

353
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:53,588
me,

354
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:55,739
but I'm smiling. And [laughs]
and I'm laughing because, like,

355
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:57,889
it was an

356
00:16:57,889 --> 00:16:59,894
internship in the digital team,
but it didn't have anything to

357
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,899
do

358
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:05,108
with, like, the website or
anything. So I had to, like,

359
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,773
shoehorn, like, "Hey, I- I need
to do something with WordPress.

360
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:08,438
I need

361
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:10,390
to do something [laughs]." But
what it ended up being was more

362
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,337
like me

363
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:16,628
working with the producers and
doing like other cool stuff. But

364
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:19,298
yeah, no. That was the extent of
like the real world application

365
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:23,798
for the master's program. So I
was like completely lost when I

366
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:27,578
was job hunting and ... yeah
[laughs].

367
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,993
Bekah: I think most people are
completely lost when they're job

368
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:34,114
hun- hunting, you know? It's
just like, there's not a lot of

369
00:17:34,114 --> 00:17:37,804
preparation and job interviews
are all over the place. So you

370
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:41,943
just never know what to expect.
And like, having to prepare so

371
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:46,263
much for each one of them makes
it really, really hard. Did you

372
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:48,453
do interview prep with Skill
Crush?

373
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:50,964
Sadie: I did. Yeah. So the
front-end developer intensive

374
00:17:50,964 --> 00:17:53,019
includes

375
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:56,243
a job hunting. Coach — like a
career coach — that helps you,

376
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:59,408
like,

377
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:02,333
with prepare your resume, and
like, prepare your cover letter,

378
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,088
and get

379
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:09,068
your like one minute, like ...
what's it called? Like a one

380
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:10,781
minute, like, spiel about
yourself and ... I don't know.

381
00:18:10,781 --> 00:18:12,488
Just

382
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:13,000
interview practice and-

383
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,000
Bekah: An elevator pitch.

384
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,608
Sadie: -how to answer questions.
Exactly. Elevator

385
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:19,989
pitch. Yeah, so Skillcrush had
that. And that really opened my

386
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:23,063
eyes to, like, how to be
strategic when job hunting. And

387
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:26,137
like -- kinda

388
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:28,898
like understand what to expect
when interviewing in the tech

389
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:31,403
field. And, yeah. Without that,
I- I really don't think I

390
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,908
would've --

391
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:38,798
or it- it either would have
taken me a lot longer to find my

392
00:18:38,804 --> 00:18:41,441
job or I would have stopped
again. And probably would've

393
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:44,078
said maybe

394
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:45,048
tech just not for me.

395
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:49,304
Bekah: Yeah. And that's so
unfortunate that there are so

396
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:51,419
many people trying to break into
tech and are just quitting

397
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,534
before

398
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,439
they get there, because the
inter- and the interview process

399
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:57,344
is not

400
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,693
reflective of most of the stuff
that you're going to be doing.

401
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:04,298
Sadie: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And like,
without that knowledge of like,

402
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:05,752
"Oh, like, I

403
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:08,153
actually don't maybe need to
know how to, like, do this

404
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:10,553
LeetCode-y

405
00:19:10,554 --> 00:19:13,434
thing," like, if you don't have
that understanding, then like --

406
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:16,314
I feel

407
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:17,724
like that's what feels like the-
the tutorial loop were like,

408
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,134
"Oh,

409
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:21,249
I need to know how to do this
weird niche thing." Or like,

410
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:23,364
"Maybe

411
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:27,144
I actually don't know enough, so
I need to keep going." Like ...

412
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:28,974
I don't know. It -- the
interview process is so, like,

413
00:19:28,974 --> 00:19:30,804
demoralizing.

414
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:32,034
Or it can be.

415
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:34,599
Bekah: That's a really good word
for -- I even think, like, some

416
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,814
of

417
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:40,703
the best interview processes are
still very exhausting and tough

418
00:19:40,703 --> 00:19:43,673
to get through. So, why don't
you -- can you walk us through

419
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:46,643
what it

420
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,534
was like to prepare for an
interview?

421
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:52,118
Sadie: Oh, that's a good
question [chuckles]. Hmm. That's

422
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:54,908
a good

423
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:57,166
question. I feel like what I did
would be to like, look at the

424
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,423
job

425
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:00,818
website, and like, look at the
people that I'm interviewing

426
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:02,213
with,

427
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:03,564
and like, kinda stalk their
Instagram -- or not Instagram

428
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:04,824
[laughs].

429
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:09,743
Their LinkedIn. I dunno why I
said Instagram. But, yeah.

430
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:11,396
Stalk their LinkedIn a little
bit and try to find, like, some

431
00:20:11,396 --> 00:20:13,043
sort of

432
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:18,173
commonality that I may have with
them and have the idea to bring

433
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:23,003
it up. Even though, like, I'm
really shy and I probably won't

434
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:24,693
ever bring up like, "Hey, I
looked at your LinkedIn." And I

435
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:26,377
noticed,

436
00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:28,058
like, I'm not that kind of
person. But just having that,

437
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:29,738
like,

438
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:33,128
background behind that person
that I'm gonna be interviewing

439
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:38,318
help me feel a little more
confident. I would also try

440
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:42,818
to gather a few questions.
VC-er, Jennifer, I don't

441
00:20:42,848 --> 00:20:46,179
remember how to say her last
name. But she has a list of

442
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:49,959
questions to ask during an
interview. Like, to the

443
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:53,979
interviewer, to try and engage
like you're fit with the role in

444
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:58,628
the company. And I would like,
look -- go back to that, to

445
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:02,138
that page, and like, pick out
questions for every single

446
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:03,998
interview that I had to make
sure that like, "Okay, this is

447
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:05,858
what I

448
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:08,858
need to know about this role and
about the company to make sure

449
00:21:08,864 --> 00:21:12,461
that I'm going to fit with
them." So in order to make it a-

450
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:16,058
a- a process

451
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:19,013
of like I'm also interviewing
the interviewer. Like, it's not

452
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:23,034
just me. It's- it's a two way
thing that I need to also be fit

453
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:24,894
-- a fit, and they need to be a
fit with me.

454
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:26,931
Dan: Yeah, I think that's- I
think that's really important.

455
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:28,086
And

456
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:30,425
it can get lost sometimes,
especially-

457
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:31,391
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

458
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,350
Dan: -I don't know. On long
journeys [laughs], on long, you

459
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,640
know,

460
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,845
struggles. But I -- so I- I was
gonna ask them -- it made me

461
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:38,930
think,

462
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:43,461
did you run into any, you know,
you said you were doing this for

463
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:44,000
so long and-

464
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,300
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

465
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,820
Dan: -how many did you say you
did? How many interviews did

466
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,260
you say? I- can't remember how
many, but like a lot-

467
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:49,086
Sadie: That was at least --

468
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:49,760
Dan: -right?

469
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:51,300
Sadie: It was a lot of
interviews, for sure.

470
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:51,500
Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

471
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,455
Sadie: It was like 250
applications and ... yeah.

472
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,700
Dan: Yeah. Wow. A-and so, like,
were- were there -- I mean,

473
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,691
you don't have to, like, call

474
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:01,340
them out or anything [chuckles],
but were there any times where

475
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,989
you were --

476
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,780
you got down the road a little
bit and were like, "Oh, I don't

477
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,451
know if this is actually a good
fit for me," you know, on your

478
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:08,840
side?

479
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:12,622
Sadie: Right. That's a good
question. There's been a few

480
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:15,205
times, I would say. But even
when that happened, I would try

481
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:17,784
to go

482
00:22:17,785 --> 00:22:19,629
into it thinking like, "Okay,
this is interview practice." Or

483
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,473
like,

484
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,802
say, I got a take-home or some,
like, technical test. I would

485
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:26,124
say,

486
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,835
"Okay, this may be outta my
wheelhouse, but I may -- I'm

487
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:29,545
still

488
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:33,115
gonna give X amount of time to
it, just to see what I can learn

489
00:22:33,115 --> 00:22:37,884
from this." Like take-home or
from this interview or from this

490
00:22:37,884 --> 00:22:39,674
interaction that I can then
hopefully improve, the next time

491
00:22:39,674 --> 00:22:41,464
I

492
00:22:41,464 --> 00:22:42,105
have an interview.

493
00:22:42,746 --> 00:22:43,930
Dan: Hm. I think that's an
awesome attitude. I, you know,

494
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,114
I've-

495
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:48,655
I've -- we've had several people
suggest, like, taking interviews

496
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:51,776
even when you're not actively
looking for jobs [laughs].

497
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:53,875
Sometimes to do that practice
cuz -- and it's just like you

498
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,944
both

499
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:58,270
were saying, it's- it's so hard
and -- emotionally hard, and

500
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,595
also

501
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:03,895
just like intellectually hard.
And I- I feel -- I mean,

502
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:06,476
interviewing is absolutely a
skill that is separate from

503
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,700
everything else, right?

504
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,000
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

505
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,391
Dan: And ... like any skill, I
think you can

506
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:14,770
get better at it with practice.
But I- I love that attitude

507
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,621
that you have. I mean, it's just
like, "Okay, this might not be

508
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:19,278
perfect or whatever, but I'm
still gonna go through, and

509
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:20,665
build

510
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,546
up the skills or whatever
[laughs]." That's awesome.

511
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:23,550
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

512
00:23:23,931 --> 00:23:25,370
Bekah: Yeah, it's really hard.
Even that idea of, like,

513
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,809
practicing

514
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,201
an interview -- you know, like
going on practice interviews, I

515
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:36,770
find to be incredibly
overwhelming to -- I have to

516
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,701
mentally prepare myself and I'm
trying to, like, make that shift

517
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,785
in mindset of, you know, "What
-- there aren't stakes here. I'm

518
00:23:42,785 --> 00:23:44,840
not

519
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,970
being judged. This is practice
to learn something." And- and

520
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,100
try and

521
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:50,555
flip it, kind of like how you
said, 'Where you're interviewing

522
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,009
the

523
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,211
company as well.' Because it's
-- it might not be a good fit.

524
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:57,845
And I would say, like, that's
some of the most advice that I

525
00:23:57,845 --> 00:23:59,479
give to

526
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,790
people who are interviewing for
their first job. They're like,

527
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:03,828
"Oh, well, what do you think
about this?" Like, that's a-

528
00:24:03,828 --> 00:24:05,445
that's a

529
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:09,226
red flag. I wouldn't go through
that. And I think maybe as I

530
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:13,246
identify what red flags are -- I
will say the more I interview,

531
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:16,875
the more I'm able to identify
what flags are. Because I put

532
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:18,303
myself in situations where I'm
like, "This is great." And then

533
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:19,725
I'm

534
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:22,546
like, "This is not great." And I
should have been able to figure

535
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,000
this out before I got into this
position.

536
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,300
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

537
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,766
Bekah: So at least, like,

538
00:24:27,826 --> 00:24:31,006
keeping track of that maybe
feels like, "All right, this is

539
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:33,536
progress. I'm learning
something." And now -- next

540
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,066
time, I'm never, never

541
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:38,000
gonna interview for anything
ever again. I've just [laughs]

542
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,405
-- want starting my

543
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:45,276
own company next because I don't
wanna have to go through that.

544
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:49,715
But if- if- if in the off chance
I do have to go through it, I- I

545
00:24:49,715 --> 00:24:51,665
really want to approach it with
the 'I'm interviewing you

546
00:24:51,665 --> 00:24:53,615
first.'

547
00:24:53,615 --> 00:24:54,111
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

548
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:56,856
Bekah: And- and that kind of
like changes the power dynamic

549
00:24:56,856 --> 00:24:59,601
in the

550
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:02,810
situation. And I think kind of
alleviates some of that stress

551
00:25:02,816 --> 00:25:06,351
that you get going into those
interviews where it's like

552
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:08,695
somebody is staring at me right
now. Well, like, "Hey, I'm

553
00:25:08,695 --> 00:25:10,249
staring

554
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:11,381
right back at you, buddy." So --

555
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:13,550
Sadie: Right, right. Exactly.

556
00:25:14,176 --> 00:25:16,817
Bekah: So, how long did you prep
for your interviews?

557
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:23,116
Sadie: That's a good question.
It would depend.

558
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:27,196
Like, I know when I was first
starting out my job- my job

559
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:28,816
hunting process, I would be
really diligent about, "Okay.

560
00:25:28,816 --> 00:25:30,405
I'm

561
00:25:30,406 --> 00:25:33,826
gonna like, make sure I have my
list of questions ready, make

562
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,359
sure I, like, review the
website, make sure I look at

563
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,886
everybody, and

564
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:39,376
all this stuff." But the more I
got, like, used to interviewing,

565
00:25:39,376 --> 00:25:41,866
I

566
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:43,456
would say the- the less I
actually like sat down and

567
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:45,046
prepped for the

568
00:25:45,047 --> 00:25:48,211
interviews which I don't know if
I would recommend or not, but

569
00:25:48,211 --> 00:25:51,375
... I

570
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:53,476
don't know. I just -- I guess, I
got just more comfortable, like,

571
00:25:53,476 --> 00:25:55,576
being

572
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:57,226
in that space of, "Okay, this is
the thing that we're doing.

573
00:25:57,226 --> 00:25:58,876
Like,

574
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:01,666
we're both trying to gauge
whether or not we're a fit, and

575
00:26:03,676 --> 00:26:05,521
we'll see what happens from
there." So -- if that makes

576
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:07,366
sense [Chuckles].

577
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,791
Bekah: Yeah. No, I love that. It
shows that you're gaining

578
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:12,611
confidence as you go forward and
you've done these practices. So,

579
00:26:12,611 --> 00:26:15,431
you

580
00:26:15,432 --> 00:26:17,187
know, that- that's more -- I
think that, you know, that's

581
00:26:17,187 --> 00:26:18,942
also one

582
00:26:18,942 --> 00:26:22,872
of those issues where people who
are continually interviewing are

583
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,076
just pushing themselves so hard
to do this prep over and over

584
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:27,280
and

585
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:28,961
over. And that also kind of
leads to that situation of,

586
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:30,641
like, you

587
00:26:30,642 --> 00:26:34,727
talked about. Like, burning out
in tech. There's definitely that

588
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:37,007
burnout in the interview
process. And so sometimes you

589
00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:39,287
have to take

590
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:41,386
a break. And the- the other part
of that is, like, when you're

591
00:26:41,386 --> 00:26:43,021
interviewing so much, you don't
have time to be working on,

592
00:26:43,021 --> 00:26:44,656
like,

593
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:48,047
personal projects or other
things. It's like a full time

594
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:48,217
job.

595
00:26:48,616 --> 00:26:50,386
Sadie: [Laughs] Exactly.
Exactly. Yeah. That was one of

596
00:26:50,386 --> 00:26:52,156
the tips that I

597
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:58,126
got while job hunting and with
the career coach, was that

598
00:26:58,132 --> 00:27:00,349
like, you can like stop trying
to keep up with personal

599
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:02,566
projects.

600
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:05,154
Like, this is what you need to
be doing. And, like, once you

601
00:27:05,154 --> 00:27:07,682
secure your

602
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:09,211
job, then you can start your
personal projects back up and

603
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,740
be,

604
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:16,711
like, getting paid for it. But,
yeah. Like, the idea was that

605
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:19,501
like, you could do both, but
like, you probably better off

606
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:22,291
not

607
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:26,281
so you can completely focus on
-- like your time and energy on

608
00:27:26,342 --> 00:27:27,392
interviewing. And then when
you're not interviewing, you

609
00:27:27,392 --> 00:27:28,442
can,

610
00:27:28,622 --> 00:27:32,852
like, be off and like, live your
life. So, yeah. You know?

611
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:36,671
Bekah: Yeah. I like the idea
too, of like giving yourself

612
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:40,060
permission. You can have
permission. It's okay to not be

613
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,451
working on these personal
projects. And I even think that

614
00:27:43,451 --> 00:27:46,510
it's okay to take a break from
interviewing, you know? I know

615
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:50,141
that people feel like they're
losing momentum or they're not

616
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:51,970
ever going to be able to find
the next interview if they're

617
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,799
not

618
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,310
doing it all the time. But, you
know, if you're burning yourself

619
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,530
out before you start, then
you're gonna start burnt out

620
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,750
too. And

621
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,800
that's not where you wanna be.

622
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,131
Sadie: Mm. Mm. Very true.

623
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:12,790
Bekah: So, as you were looking
for a job, what was your method

624
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,330
of applying? Were you applying?
Were you reaching out to people

625
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,780
personally? What kind of was the
right direction for you?

626
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:25,675
Sadie: Oh, that's a great
question. First, I started off

627
00:28:25,675 --> 00:28:30,605
just applying. So, I- I think, I
started off using like LinkedIn

628
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:33,115
and ... maybe just LinkedIn at
first. But then I started

629
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:35,545
getting more

630
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:37,511
plugged into like the different
job sites, like remote and --

631
00:28:37,511 --> 00:28:39,476
like

632
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:42,281
different remote job boards cuz
I knew I wanted to be remote.

633
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:45,086
Then

634
00:28:45,086 --> 00:28:50,816
the further along I got into my,
like, application groove, I

635
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:55,316
started reaching out to hiring
managers on LinkedIn, and even,

636
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,191
like, other engineers that were
at companies that I saw were

637
00:28:57,191 --> 00:28:59,066
either

638
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:01,135
hiring or that I thought would
be interesting to work at. And

639
00:29:01,135 --> 00:29:03,204
from

640
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:04,788
there I would try to make a
connection and be like, "Hey,"

641
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:06,371
like,

642
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:07,930
"I'm looking for engineering
roles," or, "I see that you

643
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,489
have, like, a

644
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:14,171
software engineer role open. Who
should I talk to, basically?"

645
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:16,826
And so, sometimes I wouldn't get
a response, which is fine. But

646
00:29:16,826 --> 00:29:18,971
when

647
00:29:18,971 --> 00:29:23,770
I did get a response, it would
-- usually I would get an

648
00:29:23,776 --> 00:29:26,383
interview and like, be able to
put a name to a face and, like,

649
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:28,990
start a

650
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,038
conversation. So that- that was
also another thing that I

651
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:33,086
learned that

652
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:35,996
I feel like I would probably do
more of, would be to actually

653
00:29:35,996 --> 00:29:37,960
reach out to people on LinkedIn
and like, have a conversation,

654
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,924
as

655
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:42,730
opposed to just applying or even
not even apply. Cuz I found

656
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,535
that,

657
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:51,415
like ... sometimes I would apply
to a job and like, have the

658
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,410
conversation with the hiring
manager, and then they would

659
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,405
say,

660
00:29:55,405 --> 00:29:57,355
"Okay, maybe you're not so much
of a fit for this role per se,

661
00:29:57,355 --> 00:29:59,305
but

662
00:29:59,306 --> 00:30:00,970
we have something coming down
the pipeline that you may be a

663
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,634
better

664
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:04,573
fit for." And it just kind of
opened my eyes of like, "Oh,"

665
00:30:04,573 --> 00:30:06,505
like,

666
00:30:06,536 --> 00:30:08,118
"Wait a minute." Like, "I just
need to talk to people

667
00:30:08,118 --> 00:30:09,700
[laughs]."

668
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,161
Like, this is -- I

669
00:30:11,161 --> 00:30:13,363
feel like I unlocked the key.
Like, I didn't know this before.

670
00:30:13,363 --> 00:30:15,565
But,

671
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:22,046
yeah. Yeah. I would -- yeah.
That was ... very eye opening.

672
00:30:23,414 --> 00:30:25,125
Dan: So, the people you were
reaching out to-

673
00:30:25,154 --> 00:30:25,375
Sadie: Mm.

674
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:27,989
Dan: -wait. Explain to me again.
Like, how you were choosing who

675
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:29,264
to

676
00:30:29,265 --> 00:30:30,015
reach out to?

677
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:34,288
Sadie: So, I would -- okay. Say,
I would find a role that was

678
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:38,159
interesting. So I would then go
into LinkedIn, and search the

679
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,398
company name, and then, like,
quote hiring or manager or

680
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:44,637
director or

681
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:46,483
something -- like, some higher
up or someone that's gonna be in

682
00:30:46,483 --> 00:30:47,938
the,

683
00:30:48,118 --> 00:30:52,800
like, hiring panel or something.
And then I'd pick someone-

684
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

685
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,778
Sadie: -whose title matched, and
then reach out to them. Yeah.

686
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,288
Dan: Yeah, yeah. Okay. So you'd
find a- you'd find a job opening

687
00:31:01,288 --> 00:31:02,808
on a- on a board or something
like that. And then-

688
00:31:02,808 --> 00:31:03,000
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

689
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,814
Dan: -and then you'd

690
00:31:03,814 --> 00:31:07,679
do some homework and -- yeah,
that's really cool. I love that.

691
00:31:07,683 --> 00:31:08,910
I like -- that's a great- that's
a great tip. I mean -- and I

692
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,137
think

693
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:12,069
that's like a -- I mean, aside
from the sneakiness of it

694
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:14,000
[laughs]-

695
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:14,500
Sadie: Yeah [laughs].

696
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,239
Dan: -it seems like a

697
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:16,874
really good, you know, a- a --
like, connecting with people is

698
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,509
--

699
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,118
almost always a good thing, you
know what I mean? And- and like,

700
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:23,041
as long as, I assume, you're --
I'm sure you are doing it sort

701
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:24,958
of

702
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:27,568
respectfully and with some
knowledge, you know? And not

703
00:31:27,568 --> 00:31:33,028
just blasting out the same thing
to everybody used -- you know,

704
00:31:33,118 --> 00:31:33,500
whatever-

705
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:33,700
Sadie: Yeah, yeah.

706
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,929
Dan: -a million different
people. Yeah, that's great. I

707
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:37,558
love- I love that idea.

708
00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:39,179
Sadie: Yeah. Yeah.

709
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:41,959
Bekah: It- it- it personalizes
it, right? Because before,

710
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,169
you're a

711
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:47,489
name on a sheet of a paper or an
internet form or whatever, but

712
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:51,449
now there's more. There's a face
to it, there's a voice to who

713
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:55,199
they're looking at. And then,
hiring managers or whoever can

714
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:58,048
make that connection, like, "Oh,
okay. I know this person," you

715
00:31:58,054 --> 00:32:00,509
know? Even if you haven't had an
in depth conversation, there's

716
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:02,504
something about like, oh, I- I
do -- there is already a

717
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,499
connection

718
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:06,558
there that makes it -- you're-
you're already a half, a step

719
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,617
above -- in

720
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:10,793
front of everybody else in that
pile. And that, you know, that

721
00:32:10,793 --> 00:32:12,788
can

722
00:32:12,788 --> 00:32:14,300
make the difference, you know?

723
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:14,500
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

724
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,808
Bekah: So, is that the job that
you're

725
00:32:16,814 --> 00:32:18,311
currently at? Did that start
with you reaching out to

726
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,808
somebody?

727
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:24,239
Sadie: No. It's funny. I- I saw
that job in like a- like an

728
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:28,124
email

729
00:32:28,334 --> 00:32:30,643
list. It's called Words of
Mouth, I believe? And they post

730
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:32,952
like all

731
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:34,753
these cool jobs. But -- so, I
saw that one. And then I was

732
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:36,553
about to

733
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,714
reach out to someone when
someone in my bootcamp at Skill

734
00:32:38,714 --> 00:32:40,874
Crush

735
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:43,453
was like, "Hey, you should apply
to this job. Like, we've been

736
00:32:43,453 --> 00:32:47,834
talking, and they think that you
might be a great fit." So I was

737
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,979
like, "Okay," like, "Sweet,"
like, "I just saw this job." So,

738
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:52,124
yeah. Like,

739
00:32:52,124 --> 00:32:55,356
it was, again, like that
community connection of like,

740
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:58,588
"Hey --," like,

741
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:01,709
yeah. The community connection.

742
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Dan: That's really cool.

743
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,489
Bekah: That --

744
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,300
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

745
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,200
Dan: So they had already heard
of you before you even-

746
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,459
Sadie: Yeah.

747
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:07,000
Dan: -chat? Nice.

748
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Sadie: [Laughs] Yeah. Yeah.

749
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,924
Dan: [Laughs] Isn't it funny
that, the way that that works

750
00:33:10,924 --> 00:33:12,148
out, lots of

751
00:33:12,148 --> 00:33:14,878
times, where you've done so many
applications and stuff, and then

752
00:33:14,878 --> 00:33:15,700
this- this one that actually
works?

753
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,200
Sadie: Right. [Laughs] Right.

754
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,269
Dan: Like, came about in some s-
some

755
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:20,068
strange connection in some other
way?

756
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Sadie: Yes [laughs].

757
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:20,800
Dan: Yeah?

758
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:21,500
Sadie: Exactly.

759
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,500
Dan: That's awesome.

760
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:22,788
Sadie: Exactly.

761
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:26,023
Bekah: One of my favorite things
is when people reach out to me

762
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:27,703
and they're like, "Hey, do you
know anybody that would be good

763
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:29,601
for this job?" And then like, "I
can -- like, yes, I do," you

764
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:31,499
know?

765
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,200
Sadie: Yes [laughs]. I
understand [laughs].

766
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,211
Bekah: I think, like, I'm about
to maybe submit my fifth

767
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:35,922
referral to

768
00:33:35,923 --> 00:33:39,000
somebody -- for somebody at
Deepgram. I just like --

769
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,300
[chuckles] eventually,
somebody's gonna be a good fit-

770
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:41,700
Sadie: Yes.

771
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,163
Bekah: -and I'm gonna help them
find it, you know [laughs]?

772
00:33:43,598 --> 00:33:46,143
Sadie: [Unintelligible] Yeah.
You never know, like, yeah. I- I

773
00:33:46,143 --> 00:33:48,688
can only

774
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:50,219
imagine, or like, even in being
in that position of, like,

775
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:51,749
someone

776
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:54,308
having referred me. Like, the
gratitude, like, is

777
00:33:54,308 --> 00:33:56,863
immeasurable.

778
00:33:56,864 --> 00:34:00,614
So, yeah. You're doing amazing
work, Bekah.

779
00:34:01,364 --> 00:34:04,500
Bekah: Oh, thank you. I- I also
like-

780
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,000
Dan: Just to say -- oh, go
ahead.

781
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,884
Bekah: -well, I just wanna say,
too,

782
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:10,034
when people reach out to me from
the community, and they're like,

783
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:11,774
"Hey, I wanna apply to this job.
Would you mind, like, sending a

784
00:34:11,774 --> 00:34:13,514
DM

785
00:34:13,514 --> 00:34:16,634
on my behalf? Cuz I know you're
connected with this person."

786
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:16,724
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

787
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:19,700
Bekah: And most times I do.
Sometimes there are people that

788
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,173
I'm like, "I've

789
00:34:20,173 --> 00:34:22,235
never been in a room with you or
had a conversation with you

790
00:34:22,235 --> 00:34:24,297
prior

791
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:28,378
to this point. So I just don't
feel comfortable with that. But,

792
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:30,419
if I know somebody, if I've --,"
even it -- I would say, there

793
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:32,429
have been

794
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,909
people that I probably haven't
been in the same breakout room

795
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,663
with, but I ha -- would still
recommend because I see how they

796
00:34:37,663 --> 00:34:39,417
interact

797
00:34:39,423 --> 00:34:43,228
with other people in Slack or
I've heard them talk to other

798
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:44,986
people on a lunch and -- during
a Lunch and Learn and something

799
00:34:44,986 --> 00:34:46,739
like

800
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,568
that. And I'm like, "Yeah, that
person is awesome." Like,

801
00:34:48,568 --> 00:34:50,397
they're

802
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:51,718
really patient, or they're
really knowledgeable, or they're

803
00:34:51,718 --> 00:34:53,038
really

804
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,548
great at teaching. And so I feel
comfortable being able to pass

805
00:34:56,548 --> 00:35:00,028
that along. And so, if somebody
is looking and you do have a

806
00:35:00,028 --> 00:35:02,248
connection to a community member
that has a connection, then-

807
00:35:02,248 --> 00:35:04,468
then

808
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:07,739
it's okay to reach out to them
and ask them for a

809
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,973
recommendation. And I've even
had people in the past, when I

810
00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:12,207
was a

811
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,645
teacher, say, "I need a
recommendation. Do you -- I

812
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,082
wrote

813
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:19,198
it already. Would you send
this?" [Laughs] I'm like, "All

814
00:35:19,198 --> 00:35:21,313
right. I'm gonna

815
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:24,614
change it up a little bit to put
it in my voice, but I agree with

816
00:35:24,614 --> 00:35:25,500
everything you've said-

817
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:25,700
Sadie: Yes.

818
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,213
Bekah: -and it makes it easier
on me. So, sure," you know?

819
00:35:28,623 --> 00:35:28,844
Sadie: Yes.

820
00:35:29,773 --> 00:35:31,244
Bekah: I don't think that's
cheating. I think it's just

821
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:33,673
making it a little bit easier.
And if the person feels

822
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,903
comfortable sending it, than
they will.

823
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:37,288
Sadie: Exactly. And like, you
can say what you wanna hype up

824
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:38,982
about

825
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:41,414
yourself and then have someone
co-sign that. So, yeah.

826
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:41,773
Bekah: Yes.

827
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:42,443
Sadie: Absolutely. Mm-hmm.

828
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:46,168
Bekah: Dan, you were gonna say
something and I

829
00:35:46,168 --> 00:35:47,009
interrupted you.

830
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:52,000
Dan: Mm, yeah. What do you think
it was? [Bekah and Sadie laugh]

831
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,543
It was ... oh, no. I was just

832
00:35:55,543 --> 00:35:57,208
gonna talk, like, hhype [??]
about how networking -- you

833
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:58,873
know, like,

834
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:01,514
having a network of people that
you know and could trust is- is

835
00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:03,091
so important with all this
stuff, you know? Cuz it's like

836
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:04,664
that you-

837
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:06,936
you found that reference. And
I've had people both knew they

838
00:36:06,936 --> 00:36:09,208
were

839
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,198
hiring and- and asked me, you
know? "Hey, are you looking for

840
00:36:10,198 --> 00:36:11,188
--

841
00:36:11,188 --> 00:36:12,553
like, whatever you look for a
job," or the same way as Bekah,

842
00:36:12,553 --> 00:36:13,918
like, "Do

843
00:36:13,918 --> 00:36:16,648
you know anybody that would fit
this role?" Like, "We're been --

844
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:18,000
we're- we're looking to hire
somebody."

845
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,300
Sadie: Mm.

846
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,579
Dan: It's the same kind of
thing,

847
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,298
you know? And i-if I ... I love
being able to help people, but I

848
00:36:24,304 --> 00:36:25,726
also, like, I know, like I have
-- just having a network, you

849
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:27,148
know?

850
00:36:27,148 --> 00:36:28,824
I have this, like, large safety
net [chuckles], almost, you

851
00:36:28,824 --> 00:36:30,500
know, of-

852
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:30,778
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

853
00:36:30,778 --> 00:36:32,083
Dan: -if something fell- fell
apart or whatever, you know? I-

854
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:33,388
I know I

855
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:35,361
have a bunch of people that I
can, like, lean on for help, and

856
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:37,333
support,

857
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:40,664
and stuff, in the future. So --
I dunno. It's- it's cool. It's

858
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:41,143
good stuff.

859
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:41,798
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

860
00:36:41,798 --> 00:36:41,798
Bekah: Yeah.

861
00:36:41,798 --> 00:36:44,035
Dan: I -- all of my job, all --
[chuckles] sorry. So, I'm

862
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,272
independent.

863
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:47,986
But all of my, like, clients
I've ever worked for are all

864
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:49,699
word of

865
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,000
mouth, you know?

866
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,200
Sadie: Wow.

867
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,292
Dan: Like, connections of
connections, stuff like that.

868
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,384
And

869
00:36:53,384 --> 00:36:55,199
it's always the -- you know, and
I- I work -- I have- I- I have a

870
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:57,014
network

871
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,481
of people that do my kind of
work and ... it's always this --

872
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:01,948
it's

873
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:03,314
always the -- those clients and
-- are always the ones that are,

874
00:37:03,314 --> 00:37:04,679
like, the

875
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:05,500
best clients, you know what I
mean?

876
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:05,700
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

877
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,349
Dan: As opposed to, like, the
cold

878
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:10,409
call ones or like where there's
no connection at all before. And

879
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:14,188
that's not to say it can never
work, obviously. But -- a-a-and

880
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:15,658
those- those, like, word of
mouth connections are only come

881
00:37:15,658 --> 00:37:17,128
from,

882
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:19,033
you know, building a, like, I
hate using [laughs], I don't

883
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:20,608
know. The word

884
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:22,063
network is like -- it's got like
a bunch of weird connotations,

885
00:37:22,063 --> 00:37:23,518
you

886
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:27,539
know? Cuz there's like a lot of
bad ways to do networking,

887
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,700
you know? [Sadie laughs] Like,
I've never like actively been

888
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,958
like, "I'm gonna go

889
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:34,168
network now," you know? But
that's what you end up with, you

890
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,473
know, at different communities
and- and things that -- they

891
00:37:35,473 --> 00:37:36,778
really

892
00:37:36,778 --> 00:37:38,728
are in network. It's- it's a
good word that has been poisoned

893
00:37:38,728 --> 00:37:40,678
by ...

894
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:43,200
I don't know. Connotations-

895
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,500
Bekah: [Laughs] Bad people.

896
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,028
Dan: -of other- other things.
Yeah. I dunno.

897
00:37:45,568 --> 00:37:49,887
But, anyway, that's all. Just to
say ... I don't know what

898
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:52,700
is to say other than the
community is important [laughs].

899
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,347
Welcome to Virtual Coffee
Community Podcast [laughs].

900
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,672
Bekah: Well, and community is a
great way to gain experience

901
00:37:57,672 --> 00:37:59,037
too,

902
00:37:59,038 --> 00:38:00,357
along with connections, you
know? I know there's a bunch of

903
00:38:00,357 --> 00:38:01,676
people

904
00:38:01,677 --> 00:38:05,188
that put Virtual Coffee
experience on their resume. I

905
00:38:05,193 --> 00:38:07,978
actually interviewed for a job a
couple of years ago. And

906
00:38:07,978 --> 00:38:09,103
while I was interviewing, they
were like, "Oh, yeah. Somebody

907
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:10,228
else

908
00:38:10,228 --> 00:38:11,383
from Virtual Coffee is
interviewing too. We talked

909
00:38:11,383 --> 00:38:12,538
about

910
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:13,800
it in the interview." And I'm
like [Sadie and Dan laugh] -- I

911
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,438
still don't know who that person
is. But

912
00:38:16,438 --> 00:38:21,358
I'm like, "Huh, that's really
interesting." I love it though,

913
00:38:21,362 --> 00:38:23,427
you know? It's great. Like,
everybody is giving back to the

914
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:28,527
community in some way. And like,
if- if the -- their experience

915
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:30,614
doing the support that they do
at Virtual Coffee leads to a

916
00:38:30,614 --> 00:38:32,696
job, I

917
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:34,588
love it. I am 100% here for
that.

918
00:38:35,538 --> 00:38:37,648
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

919
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,958
Bekah: Now, okay. So you've gone
on all these interviews, you've

920
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:42,222
done all these things. And I --
we- we talked about how tough

921
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:44,486
the

922
00:38:44,577 --> 00:38:46,707
interview scene is in tech. But
are there any, like, good

923
00:38:46,707 --> 00:38:48,837
interview

924
00:38:48,842 --> 00:38:51,807
stories that you have or
experiences that you're like,

925
00:38:51,813 --> 00:38:53,878
"Well, I wouldn't mind having
that one again."

926
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:57,147
Sadie: Right. Yeah. Ooh. I
think, one that stood out to me

927
00:38:57,147 --> 00:39:00,026
was -- I

928
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:03,807
think it was a two part. Like,
the first interview was like, me

929
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:06,147
gathering a whole bunch
questions. And the space was set

930
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:08,487
up

931
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:11,668
that, like, "This is your time
to ask us any questions that you

932
00:39:11,668 --> 00:39:14,084
have." And so I was super
excited [chuckles] about the

933
00:39:14,084 --> 00:39:16,500
role on the

934
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:16,947
team. So I

935
00:39:16,947 --> 00:39:22,500
had like a whole list of like 40
questions and put it [laughs] --

936
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:22,858
it's really

937
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:26,788
embarrassing now. But I really
-- I- I put it up on GitHub and,

938
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:29,458
like, created a repo of
questions and shared it with

939
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:32,038
them. And

940
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:33,867
they're like, "Oh, this is so
cool. And, like, a little

941
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:35,696
intimidated

942
00:39:35,697 --> 00:39:38,000
now cuz you have all these
questions prepared." [Laughs]

943
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,288
They were like -- but it worked

944
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,238
out cuz I- I passed to the next
round. And that next round was

945
00:39:42,238 --> 00:39:44,188
to

946
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,512
present a project that I had
been working on in -- kinda like

947
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:48,267
talk to

948
00:39:48,268 --> 00:39:50,922
them about, like, the features
or like, why I built it, and

949
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,576
have a

950
00:39:53,577 --> 00:39:55,092
discussion on like maybe how it
could be improved, and things

951
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,607
like

952
00:39:56,728 --> 00:40:00,972
that. So I thought, like, it was
super collaborative and

953
00:40:00,972 --> 00:40:06,853
like ... I don't wanna say low
stakes, but it changed the ni-

954
00:40:07,123 --> 00:40:10,393
dynamic. Cuz it wasn't like me
getting a take home, and then I

955
00:40:10,398 --> 00:40:13,722
had to get familiar with one of
the directions that they want me

956
00:40:13,722 --> 00:40:15,267
to follow, and then also think
of like, "Okay, how would I do

957
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:16,812
this?"

958
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:20,700
And like -- it like -- it's not
that. But it was a project that

959
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,762
I had made, and

960
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:24,418
like, was excited about, and
wanted to talk to other people

961
00:40:24,418 --> 00:40:27,043
about. And I

962
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:28,920
had an opportunity to see how
they would collaborate with me

963
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,793
on

964
00:40:30,793 --> 00:40:33,208
projects and like, how they
would give feedback. And -- I

965
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:35,623
don't know.

966
00:40:35,623 --> 00:40:42,822
It just felt like a- a more ...
like big picture view of the

967
00:40:42,822 --> 00:40:44,652
interviewer or- or of me. And
so, yeah, I would totally do

968
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,482
that

969
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:48,222
again. Like, if all interviews
could be like that [laughs].

970
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:51,672
Dan: That's really cool. So,
they were -- so it was to

971
00:40:51,672 --> 00:40:53,457
present some --

972
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,500
just any random project that you
had been working on-

973
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:55,700
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

974
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,637
Dan: -personally? Yeah, yeah.

975
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:56,800
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

976
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,000
Dan: That's awesome. I love that
idea.

977
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,500
Sadie: Yeah. Me too.

978
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,297
Dan: Cuz it gives you -- yeah.
It takes all the

979
00:41:00,297 --> 00:41:03,358
pressure off of the, like,
learning some unfamiliar thing

980
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,588
and -- but you can still see --
having to present it like that

981
00:41:07,588 --> 00:41:11,500
lets you sort of show off how,
you know [chuckles], much you

982
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,373
know, or what,

983
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:14,262
like, the kinds of things you
think about that, your thinking

984
00:41:14,262 --> 00:41:16,422
process is, which is the kind of
stuff that you really wanna know

985
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:17,000
when you're interviewing.

986
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,300
Sadie: Exactly.

987
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,083
Dan: Anyway, as like an
interviewer, you don't

988
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,823
wanna know -- I mean, I've
personally like -- it's like,

989
00:41:21,823 --> 00:41:23,563
okay.

990
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:25,902
There's like different skill
levels. People might -- like,

991
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,092
nobody knows everything. People
might have holes in their

992
00:41:28,092 --> 00:41:31,932
knowledge. But the thing that
you're always looking for is-

993
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:36,313
is like, the ability to like
think through problems and, you

994
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:42,657
know, sort of be able to
constructively, like, talk about

995
00:41:42,657 --> 00:41:43,578
things, right? [Dan and Sadie
laugh] And- and if you're

996
00:41:43,578 --> 00:41:44,499
talking

997
00:41:44,499 --> 00:41:45,327
about your own work, then

998
00:41:45,327 --> 00:41:47,188
you don't have to -- you know,
then you don't have the whole

999
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:48,432
step of like, learning what it
was and trying to guess what

1000
00:41:48,432 --> 00:41:49,676
they

1001
00:41:49,677 --> 00:41:50,000
were thinking or all of that-

1002
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,300
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

1003
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,239
Dan: -stuff, right? You know-
you know what you were

1004
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:53,300
thinking [laughs], right?

1005
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:53,500
Sadie: Exactly.

1006
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,947
Dan: Or like, maybe you know,
but maybe you remember

1007
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:57,000
what you were thinking, but --

1008
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:57,500
Sadie: Exactly.

1009
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,588
Dan: I like -- that's a great
idea. I

1010
00:41:58,588 --> 00:42:02,668
like- I like that. I- I don't
think I'm ever gonna hire

1011
00:42:02,668 --> 00:42:05,608
anybody, but I- I always like --
I love when I hear about things

1012
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:06,807
like that. That are like a
little bit different than

1013
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:08,006
everybody, you

1014
00:42:08,007 --> 00:42:11,847
know, than- than the usual
thing. And I take notes of 'em,

1015
00:42:11,847 --> 00:42:17,789
but ... yeah. That's nice.
That's a cool one. Okay. So you

1016
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:19,259
said -- I'm gonna jump all the
way to the now times. You said

1017
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:20,729
you

1018
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,589
work for a federal agency and
you do front-end development.

1019
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:24,448
That -- I

1020
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:27,599
think that's really interesting.
So are there -- well, I guess my

1021
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,909
question is like, can you -- are
you able to talk a little bit

1022
00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:33,329
about what that's like? Like,
working in a government agency,

1023
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:34,986
especially doing front end
stuff? I- I mean, I -- that

1024
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:36,643
makes me think of,

1025
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:39,135
like, rules and, you know, oh,
you have to like a bunch of

1026
00:42:39,135 --> 00:42:39,975
regulations you have to follow
or something like that. And

1027
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:40,815
maybe

1028
00:42:40,815 --> 00:42:40,816
that's not-

1029
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,000
Bekah: [Unintelligible] and
aliens [chuckles]?

1030
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,822
Dan: -the case, but like I --
[laughs] or, yeah. Or Bekah is

1031
00:42:42,822 --> 00:42:44,894
gonna- gonna

1032
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,014
call DARPA and, you know, get
the aliens coming. But I just

1033
00:42:48,014 --> 00:42:49,105
like would like to hear about
it. I'm just curious.

1034
00:42:49,514 --> 00:42:53,505
Sadie: Yeah. That's- that's --
yeah. Yeah. So I just started in

1035
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:57,255
April. So I'm still trying to
wrap up, like, what can I do and

1036
00:42:57,255 --> 00:43:03,251
what can't I do? But from my
understanding, that all federal

1037
00:43:03,251 --> 00:43:06,641
websites need to follow a set of
standards called the US web

1038
00:43:06,641 --> 00:43:09,896
design standard. And it's
something that's created by, I

1039
00:43:09,896 --> 00:43:13,151
believe by

1040
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:18,551
18F? They are like another,
like, kinda like agency — not

1041
00:43:18,551 --> 00:43:23,081
like

1042
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:25,856
agency, like, big agency — but
like, they create the standards

1043
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:28,631
for

1044
00:43:28,722 --> 00:43:30,566
websites across federal
agencies, if I understand

1045
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,410
correctly. But

1046
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:34,594
anyways, the US Web Design
System, it's kind of like- kind

1047
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:36,777
of like

1048
00:43:36,777 --> 00:43:40,737
Bootstrap where you put your
classes into the HTML to make

1049
00:43:40,737 --> 00:43:42,671
sure that the website is
accessible. So, like, button

1050
00:43:42,671 --> 00:43:44,605
sizes,

1051
00:43:44,606 --> 00:43:46,436
and like screen sizes, and media
queries, and things like that

1052
00:43:46,436 --> 00:43:48,266
are

1053
00:43:48,266 --> 00:43:51,626
all sort of set by these
standards, and you just kind of

1054
00:43:51,626 --> 00:43:57,117
drop it into the HTML. Yeah. I'm
still trying to learn that,

1055
00:43:57,476 --> 00:44:01,151
but ... yeah. Outside of that,
like, I- I haven't played too

1056
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:04,826
much outside of

1057
00:44:04,827 --> 00:44:08,697
that. And like, tried to really
customize the website per se,

1058
00:44:08,757 --> 00:44:15,117
because I inherited this- this
website and the properties

1059
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:17,728
for the- for the agency. And so
I don't have the really built

1060
00:44:17,728 --> 00:44:20,335
out

1061
00:44:20,336 --> 00:44:22,000
too much, like, by hand.

1062
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:22,700
Dan: Right.

1063
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,481
Sadie: Which is ... good and
bad? [Laughs] But --

1064
00:44:26,952 --> 00:44:28,632
Dan: Well, I mean, like, over
time you'll -- yeah.

1065
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:31,076
Sadie: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It'll
take some time. But, yeah. That

1066
00:44:31,076 --> 00:44:33,131
--

1067
00:44:33,132 --> 00:44:36,371
that's what I'm finding most
interesting. It seems like

1068
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:41,532
Jekyll is very favored. And
also, a-all of -- not all. But a

1069
00:44:41,532 --> 00:44:46,271
lot of the websites are on
GitHub. So you can actually see,

1070
00:44:46,302 --> 00:44:50,021
like, how these sites are built.
And if you want to, like, poke

1071
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,056
around, like, it's all there.
Yeah.

1072
00:44:53,487 --> 00:44:54,327
Dan: Nice. That's cool.

1073
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:57,416
Sadie: Yeah [laughs]. Yeah.
Yeah.

1074
00:44:58,211 --> 00:44:59,291
Bekah: So you -- you're using a
lot of Jekyll? Is that what you

1075
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:00,371
said?

1076
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:02,126
Sadie: Yeah. It's Jekyll. Yeah
[laughs].

1077
00:45:02,552 --> 00:45:02,972
Bekah: That's interesting.

1078
00:45:03,936 --> 00:45:04,226
Sadie: Yeah.

1079
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:08,156
Bekah: I -- both of my blogs are
using Jekyll because I'm not

1080
00:45:08,156 --> 00:45:10,481
really

1081
00:45:10,481 --> 00:45:13,500
even sure [chuckles] that's the
direction I went when I first

1082
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:13,871
started. And so

1083
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:16,129
I just kept going with it. And I
feel like Jekyll — this is a

1084
00:45:16,129 --> 00:45:18,382
Jekyll

1085
00:45:18,402 --> 00:45:19,991
tangent — I love using Jekyll,
but I feel like their

1086
00:45:19,991 --> 00:45:21,580
documentation

1087
00:45:21,581 --> 00:45:22,500
is terrible.

1088
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,000
Sadie: Mm. Mm-hmm.

1089
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,711
Bekah: And I keep hearing people
that love Jekyll they're

1090
00:45:25,711 --> 00:45:28,211
like, "But their community is
great. So you can ask lots of

1091
00:45:28,211 --> 00:45:31,300
questions and they'll get
answered." But I- I just want to

1092
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,512
read it in the

1093
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:35,700
documentation. Just, like,
explain this to me.

1094
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,000
Sadie: [Laughs] Right.

1095
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,581
Bekah: But also, I've never,
like,

1096
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:39,261
contributed to their
documentation. So, that's also

1097
00:45:39,261 --> 00:45:40,941
...

1098
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:43,056
something I should probably do
instead of complaining about it

1099
00:45:43,056 --> 00:45:44,091
[laughs].

1100
00:45:45,146 --> 00:45:48,567
Sadie: I hear that [laughs].
Yeah. I feel that.

1101
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:49,481
Dan: You can complain once in a
while.

1102
00:45:51,442 --> 00:45:53,032
Bekah: That's it. I'm done my
Jekyll rant. Sorry.

1103
00:45:54,472 --> 00:45:55,492
Dan: Oh, man. I- I just --
that's very interesting. I mean,

1104
00:45:55,492 --> 00:45:56,512
I've

1105
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:57,937
done -- I've concentrated on the
front end for, you know, my

1106
00:45:57,937 --> 00:45:59,362
whole

1107
00:45:59,367 --> 00:46:03,411
career. And so -- but I've never
worked with anything, you know,

1108
00:46:03,442 --> 00:46:05,547
that have any external standards
that anybody's looking at in

1109
00:46:05,547 --> 00:46:07,652
the-

1110
00:46:07,652 --> 00:46:09,177
in the code. You know what I
mean? You -- we try to, like, be

1111
00:46:09,177 --> 00:46:10,702
ex- as,

1112
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:11,976
like, accessible as possible and
every- you know, all that stuff,

1113
00:46:11,976 --> 00:46:13,250
but

1114
00:46:13,251 --> 00:46:15,771
it's always just me that's doing
those and en-enforcing it on

1115
00:46:15,771 --> 00:46:18,291
myself

1116
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:19,326
or whatever, you know, or- or
any teammates that I'm working

1117
00:46:19,326 --> 00:46:20,361
with.

1118
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:21,816
But it- it's never coming down
from above, you know what I

1119
00:46:21,816 --> 00:46:23,270
mean?

1120
00:46:23,271 --> 00:46:23,391
Sadie: Mm.

1121
00:46:23,391 --> 00:46:24,741
Dan: And so, that's- that's,
like, gotta be in- a really

1122
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:26,091
interesting

1123
00:46:26,092 --> 00:46:29,300
experience to be in that role-

1124
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:29,500
Sadie: Mm-hmm.

1125
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,791
Dan: -you know? And ... that's

1126
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:34,161
awesome that they're -- that
they are doing to open source

1127
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:35,902
stuff. That's really cool.

1128
00:46:36,262 --> 00:46:38,242
Sadie: Yes. Yeah. There's a lot
of open source of projects from

1129
00:46:38,242 --> 00:46:40,222
the

1130
00:46:40,222 --> 00:46:40,672
government [chuckles].

1131
00:46:41,512 --> 00:46:42,802
Dan: That's awesome. Yeah. That-
that makes me, like, wonder.

1132
00:46:42,802 --> 00:46:44,092
Yeah,

1133
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:45,548
just now [laughs] -- you know,
I- I always just assume that

1134
00:46:45,548 --> 00:46:46,999
it's

1135
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,452
all, like, locked

1136
00:46:47,452 --> 00:46:50,000
down, and it's all, whatever --
super-

1137
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,300
Bekah: DARPA?

1138
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,342
Dan: -custom, you know, DARPA-

1139
00:46:52,431 --> 00:46:54,426
DARPA static sites. But no,
they're just open source season

1140
00:46:54,426 --> 00:46:56,421
[??]

1141
00:46:57,262 --> 00:46:57,442
[unintelligible]. That's
awesome.

1142
00:46:57,672 --> 00:46:58,161
Sadie: [Laughs] Exactly.

1143
00:46:58,311 --> 00:47:00,405
Dan: That's so cool [laughs].
Yeah. Mm. That's cool. Thank you

1144
00:47:00,405 --> 00:47:02,499
for

1145
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,302
sharing about that. That --

1146
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,681
I find that really interesting.

1147
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,300
Sadie: Yeah.

1148
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:07,936
Bekah: Where -- what do you like
best about your job?

1149
00:47:08,822 --> 00:47:12,632
Sadie: Oh, that's a good
question. I don't know. I feel

1150
00:47:12,632 --> 00:47:16,981
like I'm- I'm gonna get kind of
meta. But that I am at a federal

1151
00:47:17,192 --> 00:47:21,271
agency [laughs], it feels like
it completes, like, a cycle or

1152
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:23,821
something, because my
grandmother and my grandfather

1153
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:26,371
were both in

1154
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:29,551
the army. And my uncles were in,
like, the army and marines. My

1155
00:47:29,551 --> 00:47:32,731
mom

1156
00:47:32,731 --> 00:47:36,931
retired military, like, retired
air force. And so I grew up in

1157
00:47:36,931 --> 00:47:41,822
the military family and always
like, had that, like, "Ooh, am I

1158
00:47:41,827 --> 00:47:43,864
gonna join the military or not?"
Or, "Am I gonna be, like

1159
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:45,901
[chuckles],

1160
00:47:45,902 --> 00:47:47,431
a contractor or something?" And
I always felt like, "Nah, that's

1161
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:48,960
not

1162
00:47:48,961 --> 00:47:52,501
for me. Nah, that's not- that's
not what I'm gonna do." And I'm

1163
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:55,636
here. Like, I'm- I'm a
contractor now. Like [laughs] --

1164
00:47:55,636 --> 00:47:58,771
so, it's

1165
00:47:59,282 --> 00:48:01,592
just like, "Oh, wow." Like, "A
family cycles are- are a thing."

1166
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:05,000
Bekah: That's such a great
story.

1167
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,300
Sadie: Thank you [laughs].

1168
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:05,500
Dan: Yeah, it's really cool.

1169
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,500
Bekah: I loved that.

1170
00:48:06,871 --> 00:48:09,841
Sadie: Yeah. Yeah. It's so
funny. Yeah. Like ... yeah, my

1171
00:48:09,841 --> 00:48:12,811
mom

1172
00:48:12,811 --> 00:48:16,546
retired, like, two months out
from my 18th birthday. So like,

1173
00:48:16,546 --> 00:48:20,281
it's, like, the

1174
00:48:20,282 --> 00:48:22,576
military and, like, that
connection is just like a part

1175
00:48:22,576 --> 00:48:24,870
of my

1176
00:48:24,876 --> 00:48:27,842
identity. And like, I feel like
that's something that, like, not

1177
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:30,046
too many people know. It's like,
I -- like, I'm- I'm, like,

1178
00:48:30,046 --> 00:48:32,250
looking

1179
00:48:32,251 --> 00:48:33,406
around right now — you can't see
this — but, like, where I am

1180
00:48:33,406 --> 00:48:34,561
right

1181
00:48:34,561 --> 00:48:39,001
now, I grew up actually on the
military base. Like, that's

1182
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:40,876
probably, like, five miles away
from my house. And, I don't

1183
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,751
know.

1184
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,761
It was just a lot of like,
"Wow," like- like, I've always

1185
00:48:44,761 --> 00:48:46,771
been

1186
00:48:46,771 --> 00:48:49,351
aware of contractors and like
... just that relationship, but

1187
00:48:49,351 --> 00:48:51,931
just

1188
00:48:52,442 --> 00:48:54,136
now being on the other side and
saying like, "Oh," like, "Huh,

1189
00:48:54,136 --> 00:48:55,830
this

1190
00:48:55,831 --> 00:48:57,406
is how- this is how it works."
And like, I can also see, like,

1191
00:48:57,406 --> 00:48:58,981
how

1192
00:48:58,981 --> 00:49:02,791
intense it is to be in the
military and like the- the sort

1193
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:05,491
of, like, expectations you have
to fulfill that role. Like-

1194
00:49:05,491 --> 00:49:08,191
like, I

1195
00:49:08,192 --> 00:49:10,186
came into this job thinking
like, "Oh," like, "Now I can't,

1196
00:49:10,186 --> 00:49:12,180
like,

1197
00:49:13,382 --> 00:49:14,691
[chuckles] be late for my job.
Or I can't, like, take-

1198
00:49:14,691 --> 00:49:16,000
[chuckles]

1199
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,092
take off work." Because

1200
00:49:18,092 --> 00:49:25,081
that's what I saw my mom, like,
having to, like ... I guess

1201
00:49:25,081 --> 00:49:27,136
fulfill or, like, be secure in
her job, but that's -- it's not

1202
00:49:27,136 --> 00:49:29,191
like

1203
00:49:29,192 --> 00:49:31,396
that at all. Like, I- I have a
wonderful team that, like,

1204
00:49:31,396 --> 00:49:33,600
respects

1205
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:37,561
work life balance and like,
people have kids, and like, they

1206
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:40,862
understand, like, you know,
today's not the day, like, just

1207
00:49:40,862 --> 00:49:43,082
come back tomorrow, and it'll be
okay. Like, that sort of thing.

1208
00:49:43,082 --> 00:49:45,302
So,

1209
00:49:45,306 --> 00:49:48,229
yeah. It- it's a -- it's really
deep. But, yeah. That's my

1210
00:49:48,229 --> 00:49:51,152
answer [chuckles].

1211
00:49:53,266 --> 00:49:55,577
Bekah: I like that. I mean,
there's- there's familiarity

1212
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:57,181
there, right? And then there's
comfort that comes with that.

1213
00:49:57,181 --> 00:49:58,785
And

1214
00:49:59,086 --> 00:50:01,011
when you're talking about taking
on a new job, it's really nice

1215
00:50:01,011 --> 00:50:02,936
to

1216
00:50:02,936 --> 00:50:05,686
be able to have something like
that, where you can feel

1217
00:50:05,686 --> 00:50:07,547
comfortable in some aspect of
what you're doing.

1218
00:50:08,251 --> 00:50:11,311
Sadie: Right. Exactly. Exactly.

1219
00:50:14,086 --> 00:50:18,047
Bekah: Well, we're at just about
time here. Is- is there any last

1220
00:50:18,047 --> 00:50:22,217
piece of advice you have for our
listeners who are prepping for

1221
00:50:22,277 --> 00:50:26,117
interviews or leaving bootcamps
and about to discover the next

1222
00:50:26,117 --> 00:50:27,047
stage of their journey?

1223
00:50:27,467 --> 00:50:33,300
Sadie: Ooh, that's -- okay. I
could say so much. But [laughs]

1224
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:33,646
I hate to

1225
00:50:33,646 --> 00:50:37,157
say, like, something trite, but
like, also, like, one, trust

1226
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:42,436
process. And then two, you know
more than you think. Like, for

1227
00:50:42,436 --> 00:50:45,677
example, I didn't know Jekyll at
all when I was interviewing for

1228
00:50:45,677 --> 00:50:48,294
this job. But, one, I reached
out to my community. So, if you

1229
00:50:48,294 --> 00:50:50,911
need a

1230
00:50:50,911 --> 00:50:55,442
community, find your community.
VC's here, but there's also

1231
00:50:55,442 --> 00:51:00,121
others. And then two, like, do
what you can, explain what you-

1232
00:51:00,302 --> 00:51:03,121
what you did and, like, your
thought processes. And if it's

1233
00:51:03,121 --> 00:51:06,302
not the fit, it's not a fit. But
you will find your job and you

1234
00:51:06,302 --> 00:51:06,661
can do it.

1235
00:51:07,021 --> 00:51:08,552
Dan: I love that. Trust the
process.

1236
00:51:10,262 --> 00:51:12,552
Bekah: Yeah, I love that. Thanks
so much, Sadie, for being here

1237
00:51:12,811 --> 00:51:15,661
with us today. We've grabbed all
the links for the stuff that you

1238
00:51:15,661 --> 00:51:18,661
dropped, including your blog
post on technical test

1239
00:51:18,722 --> 00:51:20,792
preparation advice, and we'll
put those in the show notes. And

1240
00:51:20,792 --> 00:51:22,862
