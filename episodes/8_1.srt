00:00:35,518 --> 00:00:37,798
Bekah: It's going amazing.Dan,
how's it going with you?

10
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:41,536
Dan: I'm feeling pretty good.I'm
excited about getting back into

11
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:46,845
the podcasting thing.We got new
season,whole new set of guests

12
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:52,905
and we are kicking it off with,
uh,maintainers podcast,which is

13
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:55,185
always kind of fun to get the
maintainers group together.And

14
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:59,026
this,uh,episode kind of
introduces our brand new

15
00:00:59,085 --> 00:01:03,780
maintainer,Julia.Yeah,we're very
excited to have Julia on board as

16
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,131
a maintainer for many,many,many
reasons.And,um,and it was really

17
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:11,700
great to sit down with,with,uh,
Julia and Kirk and Bekah of

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,600
course,and,uh,talk about lots and
lots of cool stuff.

19
00:01:16,513 --> 00:01:19,153
Bekah: Yeah,it was great to be
able to share kind of a little

20
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:23,353
bit about the process that we
took to finding a new maintainer.

21
00:01:23,353 --> 00:01:28,993
It did take a while.Um,but for
us,the important factors we're

22
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:32,293
thinking about somebody who's
been active in our community is

23
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:37,694
somebody who we know that invest
time and who supports the mission

24
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:42,418
of virtual coffee and who's
willing to.Have conversations

25
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:46,468
with community folks to continue
to make this a welcoming and

26
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:51,239
supportive space.So,uh,when we
looked at our short list of folks

27
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,489
that we think,uh,we thought might
be a good maintainer for our

28
00:01:56,493 --> 00:02:01,168
community,Julia definitely stood
out and being able to do all of

29
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:05,248
those things.So we really
appreciated bringing her in as

30
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:08,998
part of our maintainers,but also
hearing her share all of the

31
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:12,359
different parts that helps to
make our community strong.

32
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,605
Dan: A Absolutely I and,and I'm.
I'm really glad that we decided

33
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:20,776
to do this as the first episode,
cuz I think you'll hear all of,

34
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:25,126
you'll hear like,evidence of all
the reasons that we wanted Julia

35
00:02:25,126 --> 00:02:28,485
to be maintainer.Were excited
about her.Um,she's like,she

36
00:02:28,485 --> 00:02:32,656
brings a lot of thoughtfulness
and,um,I don't know,good intent

37
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:36,436
to everything.Good intent is a
strange phrase.So I'm gonna,uh,

38
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:39,045
I'm gonna walk away from that
one.But like,it,it,it's just the,

39
00:02:39,346 --> 00:02:41,686
the way that Julia approaches
different things,approaches,

40
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:45,135
conflict,approaches happy things,
approaches all sorts of things is

41
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:51,496
both unique And like,uh,I don't
know.It's just,she's just like

42
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:55,816
such a comforting presence.
Empathetic.Yes.Exactly.Um,you

43
00:02:55,816 --> 00:03:02,235
know,and,and she is,I,before she
was a maintainer,she,she would

44
00:03:02,235 --> 00:03:05,574
help.She has helped many,of our
other members work through

45
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:09,008
things.Um,she's helped.You know,
when some members were having

46
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:12,038
conflicts or whatever,uh,and
nobody asked her to Right.You

47
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:16,808
know,at all.Um,and she wouldn't
insert herself,but would would

48
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:20,649
just provide opportunities for
people to,you know,maybe reflect

49
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:24,038
a little bit different on,on some
things.And,um,and I don't know.

50
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:24,579
She's great.

51
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:29,407
Bekah: Yeah,and I think that,you
know,in this episode and beyond

52
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:32,287
Virtual Coffee,we think that
culture citizenship is a really

53
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:35,917
important thing.And what is
culture citizenship?It's one of

54
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:38,826
those things that helps us to
define what makes a really

55
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:42,727
positive culture for a community.
And so whether or not you're part

56
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:45,097
of the virtual coffee community,
you're starting your own

57
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:48,516
community,or you're participating
in a current community culture,

58
00:03:48,516 --> 00:03:51,937
citizenship is one of those
things that ensures that

59
00:03:51,937 --> 00:03:56,016
everybody feels safe,heard,and
understood.And so we take some

60
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:58,866
time breaking down what that
looks for us in this episode of

61
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:05,502
Virtual Coffee to ensure that we
are constantly.Doing our best to

62
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:08,262
make sure that this is a positive
space for people,that it's

63
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:12,102
welcoming for our current and
future members of the

64
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:15,822
organization.And we wanna make
sure that we can support not only

65
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:19,961
our organization at Virtual
Coffee,but other organizations

66
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:23,711
out there that are starting or
are trying to create a positive

67
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:26,442
space for people.Because we know
that it's important to have

68
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:31,482
positive spaces for people in
tech and beyond tech.And this is

69
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:36,028
one of the ways that we can do
it.We start every episode of the

70
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:39,088
podcast,like we start every
virtual coffee.We introduce

71
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:41,999
ourselves with our name,where
we're from,and what we do.And a

72
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:53,202
random check-in question.We hope
you enjoy this episode.Uh,our

73
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:58,992
intro question today is,would you
rather be stranded on a tropical

74
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:07,892
island alone for a month or stuck
in traffic for one day?My name is

75
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:12,733
Bekah.I have a new job title.I'm
developer experience lead at Open

76
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:18,718
Sauce from a small town in Ohio,
and I don't like to be stuck in

77
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:23,187
traffic for30seconds,so I'll
definitely go to that tropical

78
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:24,327
island by myself.

79
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:31,194
Dan: Um,hi,I'm Dan,and as always,
I have questions.So the traffic,

80
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:35,004
is it like you're not moving at
all or are you moving little bits

81
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:38,684
all the time?you could be moving.
two different situations.Yeah.

82
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:40,884
Yeah.Okay.Yeah.So that's,uh,
that's the worst,right?Because

83
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:45,461
One time I was on a road trip
with my friend,I have two friends

84
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:50,500
down to Savannah,uh,Georgia,and
we got stuck in a traffic jam on

85
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:53,190
like a bridge,but it was
literally not moving at all.And

86
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,810
we got out and played Frisbee,
catch on the bridge,on the inter

87
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,190
on the interstate.It was awesome.
Uh,but yeah,no,if you're moving,

88
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,771
like,if you're moving little bits
all the time,that's the worst

89
00:06:02,814 --> 00:06:05,365
What if you're stopped?Would you
rather be on the tropical island

90
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,980
if you were stopped?uh,I mean,
I'd have to think about it a

91
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:14,290
little bit more,you know,but
like,I don't know.I mean,also

92
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,625
this is just like,happens with my
life if I'm gone for a month?You

93
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:22,706
know?You know what I mean?Like,
you know,uh,I think I would,my

94
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:25,675
responsibility,I would have to
just choose the day,um,just

95
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:29,495
because of kids and I suppose job
and whatever,but,I feel like

96
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:33,384
you're making me look bad now.a,
tropical island for a left them

97
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:41,875
all.awesome.there supplies on the
island?No.Is it,is it,I mean,can

98
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:46,105
you guarantee that there is stuff
there to survive?Whether you have

99
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,755
to like do it yourself,but like,
you know,

100
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,668
Bekah: There's definitely some
water that you can drink and

101
00:06:50,673 --> 00:06:54,059
probably some leaves or tropical
fruit that you can eat.

102
00:06:54,896 --> 00:06:57,086
Dan: Okay.Yeah,and like fish and
stuff,

103
00:06:57,598 --> 00:06:59,699
Bekah: Maybe.There's definitely
no toilet paper.

104
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,139
Dan: There's leaves.Yeah.You just
said right.

105
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,694
Julia: well,and like whatever
body of water surrounds it.You

106
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:06,843
could

107
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:07,992
Bekah: Natural B day,

108
00:07:13,314 --> 00:07:14,723
Julia: You said it,not me.

109
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:18,923
Dan: uh,I wanna,I wanna go with
island,but like,you know,I don't

110
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:19,134
know.

111
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,173
Bekah: you're responsible.

112
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:24,444
Dan: Yeah,I don't know.It's tough
being on an island would be sweet

113
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,774
though.I always wanted to try
that,you know,like the castaway

114
00:07:27,774 --> 00:07:32,093
thing.Always wanted to know,you
know,just to know if I could,you

115
00:07:32,093 --> 00:07:34,494
know,survive it.So,I dunno.

116
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,867
Bekah: Did you do the rest of
your intro?

117
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:42,774
Dan: Oh,I don't know.Uh,I'm Dan,
I do web development stuff and I

118
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:47,228
live in Cleveland,Ohio.Now I'm
done.Kirk,it's your turn.

119
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:51,959
Kirk: Oh,I thought,I thought we
were going,if you're listening,

120
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,629
you can't see this,but like in
the Hollywood squares that we

121
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:59,468
are,Julius Next and Clockwise,
um,I have so many thoughts on.

122
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:03,983
The incorrect things

123
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:06,896
Bekah: Why don't you start with
your intro and then you can tell

124
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:07,596
us why we're wrong.

125
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:14,213
Kirk: intro is less important.
Uh,my name is Kirk.I currently

126
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:19,723
live in Alberta,Canada.Um,I like
functional programming.I'm one of

127
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:23,302
the maintainers of virtual
coffee.But the important part,so

128
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:29,423
first of all,living stranded on
a,like Irma is like not far away

129
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:31,403
from my actual life,really.

130
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:33,044
Julia: Minus the tropical

131
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:38,297
Kirk: I mean,you know,that's,
it's not that hard.You don't have

132
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:40,876
to poop in the ocean if you don't
wanna,

133
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:42,255
Bekah: I did

134
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:44,217
Kirk: That was definitely an
opt-in moment there.

135
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:44,895
Bekah: to be clear,

136
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:51,345
Kirk: You like encouraged it as
like option A for sure.And also

137
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:55,184
Dan said that story,Dan,you said
you were with your friend,we're

138
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:58,754
your friends.And we don't
remember this story,so that story

139
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:07,562
can't be true.Um,anyway,I would
do unspeakable things,so I have

140
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:11,162
to avoid traffic for even a
millisecond.And I would happily

141
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:16,471
return to a traffic.for a month,
um,actually did spend a week in

142
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:23,730
like my dad's cabin,which had
like no electricity,um,and just

143
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,841
like an open tank for water for
like a week before I went off to

144
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:30,480
college.And it was fine.

145
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,975
Dan: How to build cabins and open
tanks from scratch,though.

146
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:36,394
Kirk: Why not?

147
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:39,215
Julia: A person of many talents,

148
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,990
Dan: Is there a volleyball there
that you can make friends with,

149
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:44,817
Kirk: What?No.Okay.Like,

150
00:09:45,072 --> 00:09:45,822
Dan: know,from Castaway?

151
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:49,182
Julia: you never know what's
gonna wash up on the beach.

152
00:09:50,307 --> 00:09:55,317
Kirk: let's not let Tom Hanks'
lived experience be the,be the

153
00:09:55,317 --> 00:10:00,178
example that we all must live by.
okay,we're then,I'm done.This

154
00:10:00,178 --> 00:10:02,849
also reminds me of that episode
of Naked and Afraid that was in

155
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:06,028
fact filmed on my island,which is
a hilarious episode because to

156
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:11,519
spend the whole time going,it's
so cold.There's no food.But like

157
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:15,619
my island is literally the size
of like Manhattan.Like,you're,

158
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:19,259
you're,you're like never more
than30minutes away from a village

159
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:22,198
and there's like food everywhere.
Like,none of that made any sense.

160
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:24,658
So for those of you who've ever
watched a Negative,afraid on

161
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:28,976
Discovery Channel,it's not true.
Except they're naked.They are

162
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:29,366
naked,

163
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:32,652
Dan: Are there clothes on our
tropical island that you're

164
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:35,711
stranded on?Well,I mean like are
you wearing one set of clothes at

165
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:36,101
least?

166
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:37,386
Julia: Why does it matter?

167
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:40,535
Dan: Well,I wouldn't wanna be
naked on a tropical island for a

168
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:40,865
month.

169
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:47,250
Bekah: I mean,You can wear your
own clothes.You don't get dropped

170
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:48,149
on there naked.

171
00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:50,285
Dan: Okay.That's how I was just
asking.I was just clarifying.

172
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:51,596
Kirk,Kirk,Kirk brought it

173
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,990
Bekah: wanna apologize to Dan's
mom if she is listening to this

174
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,409
podcast right now.I'm sorry.How
out of hand this has gotten?

175
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,230
Dan: Listen,inquiring minds want
to know,you know,gotta know all

176
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,030
the parameters to the question
before you answer it.

177
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:13,778
Julia: Well,I think it's my turn
Um,I'm Julia.I am a developer.

178
00:11:13,778 --> 00:11:21,698
Educator.Um,And technical content
creator.I work with developer

179
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:29,650
tools companies.I live outside
Seattle.Um,and I,yeah,I really

180
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:35,190
hate traffic.Um,I think the only
way I'd be okay with it is like

181
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,879
if I knew I could get out of the
car cuz it,that's one thing we

182
00:11:38,884 --> 00:11:42,840
have a lot of drawbridges around
here and sometimes you get stuck

183
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:46,409
with a drawbridge opening and
like,I got stuck one time in the

184
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:49,960
I five drawbridge between Seattle
and Portland.Or like,right as

185
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,029
you're going into Portland,when
that thing opens,you're stuck for

186
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:58,830
like two hours while it opens and
closes.Like the whole interstate

187
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:03,929
just stops.Um,and that's actually
fine.Like we blasted some girl

188
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:08,429
talk and had a dance party and
that was terrific.Uh,but that was

189
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:13,645
only two hours and you could get
out of the car.So I don't,yeah,I

190
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:19,523
mean,responsibilities.
Responsibilities.Don't.The

191
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:24,293
tropical island,I don't even like
tropical climates.

192
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:29,375
Kirk: I only think of drawbridge
as an association of castles.So

193
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,706
what I'm hearing you say is
Seattle is filled with castles

194
00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:35,015
and you all just visit each
other's castles from near

195
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:35,706
castles.

196
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:37,546
Julia: No,but

197
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:40,275
Kirk: Right.

198
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,110
Dan: Incorrect,sir.

199
00:12:43,115 --> 00:12:46,912
Julia: no,it's kind of,there's a
lot of water.That's why.Careful

200
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:51,912
Kirk: Drawbridges are for?
They're for alligators.

201
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:55,017
Julia: either.See,that's why I
don't like tropical places.I

202
00:12:55,017 --> 00:12:56,456
don't.I choose neither.I.

203
00:12:57,966 --> 00:12:59,177
Dan: I don't think that was a
choice.

204
00:13:04,126 --> 00:13:06,386
Kirk: You don't have to,he's
naked.

205
00:13:10,427 --> 00:13:11,297
Dan: gotta do what you gotta do.

206
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,230
Bekah: Okay,well now that we
spent nine minutes going through

207
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,181
that scenario,Uh,you might be
wondering why are there four of

208
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:27,921
us here when traditionally we've
had three maintainers,and that's

209
00:13:27,926 --> 00:13:31,941
because yay,we've added Julia as
a maintainer at virtual coffee.

210
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:38,020
Uh,what does that mean?That means
that the four of us work together

211
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,280
to help look at the health of the
community,the wellbeing of the

212
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,380
members and the volunteers,and to
make decisions about what's

213
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:54,620
happening at Virtual coffee.And
so for this podcast episode,I

214
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:59,421
wanna talk a little bit about,
uh,culture,citizenship and what

215
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:04,311
it means to be a good member of a
community or a positive member of

216
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:08,961
a community.And that goes into
conversation about why we added

217
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:13,701
Julia as a maintainer to begin
with and how that process went.

218
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,885
And so for us,we.We're looking
at,there was a,a need to be

219
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:23,596
filled at virtual coffee.And so
we were thinking about,you know,

220
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:27,405
how can we continue to support
the existing members and who

221
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:32,566
would be a great person to help
us with that.And Julia has been a

222
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:38,086
really active member of Virtual
Coffee.She has,uh,been leading

223
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:42,405
the tech interview study group
every week,supporting members,

224
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:47,625
hangs out in the co-working room
and is always very thoughtful in

225
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,676
her approaches and responses to
other people.And so it was

226
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:57,456
really,um,Great to be able to
think of Julia in that role and

227
00:14:57,456 --> 00:15:00,936
to know that she's somebody that
we can have conversations with.

228
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:03,576
And sometimes there's hard
decisions to be made or sometimes

229
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:06,696
there's complicated things that
happen.And to know that we could

230
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:09,576
be open and honest with each
other.So I just wanna,first of

231
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:15,966
all,thank Julia for all of the
positive interactions,um,and

232
00:15:15,971 --> 00:15:18,846
support that she's brought to
virtual Coffee since becoming a

233
00:15:18,846 --> 00:15:23,706
member.And then maybe kick off
this conversation about what it

234
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:26,796
means to be a positive community
member.

235
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:33,081
Kirk: yeah,it's,it's really great
to have,uh,Julia join the

236
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:37,942
maintainers.Um,and I mean,I don't
know,we can,we can talk more

237
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:41,572
about like how the process went,
like how that kind of works.Um,

238
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:43,672
and I feel like,I don't know,one
of the things I was thinking

239
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:49,312
about is that VC is a very,like,
we try to be a very opt in

240
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:53,241
community,you know,so like the
roles and responsibilities of

241
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:57,261
folks here,it's like either folks
are like,Hey,I would like to try

242
00:15:57,261 --> 00:16:02,451
this thing,or I'm interested in
this thing.Um,so,you know,and

243
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:05,871
like on the one side of like us
being like,Hey,we think Julia

244
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:08,451
might be a really great fit for
this role,it was also Julia being

245
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:12,381
like,Hey,you know,like I really
like this space and this feels

246
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:19,182
like one of the ways I want to be
a part of it.Right.So that was,I

247
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:22,417
don't know that.That also feels
like really important,like at

248
00:16:22,422 --> 00:16:24,907
both sides you're like,Hey,we
think this could be a good idea

249
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:28,476
and we can make this work.Um,and
it did,and I'm super happy about

250
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:37,567
Julia: Well,so far,I don't know.
When's my first evaluation's

251
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:38,636
like,oh,what are my OKRs?

252
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,081
Bekah: No,

253
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:39,886
Julia: I,

254
00:16:40,557 --> 00:16:41,006
Dan: Oh no.

255
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,760
Bekah: no,we don't do this.
Thanks here.

256
00:16:44,096 --> 00:16:47,667
Dan: Yeah,if you think we have
OKRs set up for anything,uh,

257
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:52,866
Kirk: if the first nine minutes
of this conversation didn't

258
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,037
indicate.

259
00:16:57,027 --> 00:16:57,447
Julia: yeah,

260
00:16:57,551 --> 00:17:00,520
Bekah: so,uh,let's take us in the
direction of culture citizenship,

261
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,280
cuz I know that's something that
we all have talked about as

262
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:07,810
maintainers in our conversation.
And so,culture citizenship,

263
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:12,431
there's a section in our code of
conduct about that.And so let's

264
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,010
see,the beginning of it says,and
we'll link this in the show

265
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,590
notes,one of the many goals of
this code of conduct is to

266
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,770
strengthen our community uplift
and encourage each other and to

267
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:25,421
recognize the positive effects of
our community on the industry as

268
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:31,030
a whole.Um,well I,let's start
there.I feel like maybe I,we

269
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,790
could break this down into
separate conversations.So the

270
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,510
idea of what are the positive
effects of our community on the

271
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,921
industry as a whole?What are we
trying to do at virtual coffee

272
00:17:41,921 --> 00:17:45,461
that impacts more than the
immediate group of people?

273
00:17:46,102 --> 00:17:48,172
Dan: I think there's a lot of
things,uh,personally,I mean,

274
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:53,902
sorry I don't jump in,but like I,
I was in today in virtual coffee.

275
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:57,442
We were talking about,uh,in my
breakout room,we were talking

276
00:17:57,442 --> 00:18:00,951
about mentorship and you know,
how to learn.And somebody was

277
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:05,571
using,or thinking about using,
uh,code,code mentors or some sort

278
00:18:05,571 --> 00:18:09,352
of service right?To,to basically
help them learn,um,help them

279
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:12,082
accomplish some tests.And we were
talking,and this was a new member

280
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:14,692
who hadn't,this was their first
time and hadn't been in the

281
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:18,711
slack.And we spent a lot of time
just talking about,um,our

282
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:22,102
community and how we've,like,how
virtual coffee has like,helped

283
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:28,102
each other.Um,learn how to learn,
you know,and learn how to,and

284
00:18:28,162 --> 00:18:32,362
especially along with that,learn
how to ask for help and also

285
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:37,537
learn how to give help in.
Constructive ways.And I

286
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:40,326
personally,just speaking for
myself,have,I feel like I have

287
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:44,136
taken a lot of those lessons,uh,
over the last few years.A few

288
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:47,317
years,two years,three years.
Yeah.We're coming up on three

289
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:49,807
years.Right.Anyway,um,

290
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:51,026
Bekah: We've completed three

291
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:53,977
Dan: we have completed three
years.And,uh,that's what I said.

292
00:18:54,186 --> 00:18:59,172
And,um,uh,I'll just have my
editor edit that out.I'm just

293
00:18:59,176 --> 00:19:04,842
kidding.It's me.Um,and we have,
all right,I lost track of what I

294
00:19:04,846 --> 00:19:08,531
was saying.Oh yeah.My personal
experience is I have become,

295
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:13,021
I've,I feel like I've become a
better,um,developer just from

296
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:16,182
learning how to learn better,
right.And learning how to ask

297
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:19,541
questions better and learning
like what kinds of things can I

298
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,781
ask questions about it,at what
point do I ask the question,what

299
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:25,241
point do I form?Like how do I
formulate a good,a good question

300
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:29,021
to get some help and or generate
some discussion?And I feel like

301
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:32,021
just as there's a lot of aspects,
and this is the only one of'em,

302
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:38,757
but,um,Creating better
developers,honestly,is like a,a

303
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:41,366
way that we are,uh,you know,
maybe having some positive

304
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:45,086
impact,impact on the greater
developer community and not just

305
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:50,487
developers,but better.Um,I don't
know,people,I don't know.I,I

306
00:19:50,547 --> 00:19:52,977
like,I I want to,you know,we're,
we're not all developers,but I

307
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:57,354
feel like a lot of these lessons
apply to,to everybody.Um,and so,

308
00:19:58,074 --> 00:20:01,314
I dunno,that's,that's my bit.
First thing that jumped in.

309
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:06,337
Julia: Yeah,no,I think that's,I
think the idea of like better

310
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:12,026
people,it's not just like a
throwaway,I mean,the purpose,the

311
00:20:12,026 --> 00:20:17,066
purpose of any of the work that
we do in the end is about making

312
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,685
people's lives better,right?Like
what's,you know,the,the end goal

313
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:25,135
of any piece of software
hopefully has something to do

314
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:32,006
with improving,improving people's
lives in some way.Um,and I,I feel

315
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:39,865
like that's not just a,an empty.
It's like an,you know,an empty

316
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:44,905
value promise.You know,it's not
just marketing speak within the

317
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:53,125
VC community,like people really
take that idea to heart.Um,and it

318
00:20:53,131 --> 00:20:59,455
gets talked about and expanded on
in a lot of different ways within

319
00:20:59,455 --> 00:21:04,016
the community.And I,I have to
imagine that that spills over

320
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:09,451
into,um,what people are doing in
their jobs.You know,I've,like,

321
00:21:09,457 --> 00:21:16,878
with my background as an educator
and like working in this sort of

322
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:21,693
developer experience,developer
education space,like I've,worked

323
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:27,844
with other VC members to kind of
f flesh out proposals for

324
00:21:27,844 --> 00:21:34,404
changing processes in their
workplaces.Um,And,you know,that

325
00:21:34,404 --> 00:21:38,449
kind of embrace those,like that
shared value,those shared

326
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:43,788
principles.Um,and I,I think it's,
I think it's really good to have

327
00:21:43,788 --> 00:21:48,638
a community where people are
actually talking about those

328
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:56,209
things separate from,like,
anybody who's worried about the

329
00:21:56,209 --> 00:22:01,999
budget or,you know,the,the
performance reviews.Like having

330
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:06,709
those conversations and seeing
what other people are doing with

331
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:12,976
those principles,like independent
of your workplace.I'd like to

332
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:18,675
think it has value.I don't really
know how to,how to be sure.But.

333
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:23,315
Bekah: What's interesting too,
um,I think it was Mark Newnan who

334
00:22:23,315 --> 00:22:28,734
works at Cypress,posted about
where are the questions,maybe the

335
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:32,845
intro questions that we use in
virtual coffee.So I may want to

336
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:36,585
be using these for my team
meetings,right?And so even simple

337
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:42,204
things like that,I think that
there's value to be able to see

338
00:22:42,204 --> 00:22:44,575
like,hey,this is something that
works in our community and I

339
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:48,390
wanna ex.Extend it to my other
parts of other communities that

340
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,809
I'm involved in.And one of the
things that,one of the ways that

341
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:55,319
I like to think of virtual coffee
is there's this idea of like the

342
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:58,980
ripple effect,right?Like you make
an impact on someone and that

343
00:22:58,984 --> 00:23:01,890
ripples out to the next person,
and then they pass that on to the

344
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,490
next person.And so if we can
interact with each other very

345
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:09,329
positively,if we can share a
supportive environment,if we can

346
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:13,349
help people understand what a
positive space looks like,then

347
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:16,259
that's going to continue to move
out into the tech industry.So

348
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:19,259
although we cannot support
everybody being virtual coffee

349
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:22,250
members,hopefully through that
extension of our members into

350
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,369
other communities,they'll still
be able to experience that

351
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:27,539
positivity as well.

352
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:32,038
Julia: Right,right.Yeah,for sure.
Like I think,you know,other

353
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:36,990
communities that I'm involved in,
other organizations,like even

354
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,965
outside the tech industry,I
reflect on conversations that

355
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:47,885
I've had inside vc.That inform
like kind of how I relate to

356
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:52,026
people or ideas that I might
suggest in those communities too.

357
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:52,435
So,

358
00:23:53,707 --> 00:23:57,190
Kirk: Yeah.And I think there's
also like a real,there's a real

359
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,579
nice,like,I was gonna use the
phrase value proposition,that's

360
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:04,260
not really it,but just,uh,what do
you call it?Like,uh,like gut

361
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,961
check.Like we have a lot of cut
check moments where people kind

362
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:08,881
like,Hey,I just started a new
job.Or like,Hey,I'm gonna have

363
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,641
this conversation if my manager,
Hey,I just had this conversation

364
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:14,763
with someone.My workplace like,
what is your take on this

365
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:18,423
scenario?And this is one of the
few spaces where I feel like I'm

366
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:24,364
gonna get.Like reasonable,
meaningful responses,you know,

367
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:28,983
and people will try their best to
answer earnestly.Um,and then

368
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:31,594
everyone might not have like,be
in perfect agreement.Like the

369
00:24:31,594 --> 00:24:34,534
amalgamation of those things like
usually puts me in like a,a

370
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:37,653
better place or whoever's asking
the question,you know,and folks

371
00:24:37,683 --> 00:24:42,183
can feel reasonably assured,
like,this is a bunch of responses

372
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:45,064
of like,my best interest in mind.
I can sort of take those and kind

373
00:24:45,064 --> 00:24:47,973
of go with it.So,you know,like we
have the help parenting channel

374
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:50,044
where people ask,sometimes ask
like very specific questions

375
00:24:50,044 --> 00:24:54,183
like,oh,I can't like get this a
diiv to diiv.Um,but people also

376
00:24:54,183 --> 00:24:56,943
ask questions like,I'm about to
have like,my first performance

377
00:24:57,183 --> 00:24:59,705
review.Like what should I expect?
It's not only a place to like set

378
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:04,115
expectations of what is maybe
like the standard or usual

379
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:08,526
behavior.It's also a place to set
expectations of like how you

380
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:14,346
should advocate for yourself.Um,
what behaviors like should,you

381
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,806
know,like it's,it's,it's a great
place to sort of establish like,

382
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:21,290
The right thing to do versus just
like the thing that happens,uh,

383
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,740
which is a nuance that sometimes
feels lost in like the greater

384
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,780
tech world.Like people are like,
oh,well this goes like this,

385
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:29,840
which isn't the same as like this
is how this should go,or this is

386
00:25:29,846 --> 00:25:33,711
how it could go if everyone
involved was like trying to act

387
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,371
like more empathy to get towards
a good solution.So I like the

388
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:38,931
space for that.That feels pretty
good.

389
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:43,569
Dan: Yeah.And I think another
valuable thing that,um,virtual

390
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:47,230
coffee does that maybe some other
communities don't do,and there's

391
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:49,660
lots of other great communities
out there in the world,but,uh,

392
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:54,039
where,you know,our,our,like,our
focus on intimacy and

393
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:58,000
face-to-face interactions and,
you know,our,our coffees,which

394
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,172
are,are like main,you know,
obviously our main thing.Um,want

395
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:06,857
to say that I,I feel like that
is,is,proving to people the

396
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,836
importance of,of these,of,kinds
of effects,right?And lots of

397
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,195
times,you know,people get too
involved in like Slack or

398
00:26:14,226 --> 00:26:16,596
whatever,and async communication
and all that stuff is important

399
00:26:16,601 --> 00:26:20,465
and,and valuable,especially on.
You know,international teams,

400
00:26:20,526 --> 00:26:24,455
teams of time zones and
everything like that.Um,but there

401
00:26:24,455 --> 00:26:28,511
is something to be said about
the,small interactions.These,

402
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:32,142
like intimate,you know,uh,not
just our coffees,right?We have

403
00:26:32,146 --> 00:26:34,332
our coffees in our bigger rooms.
We also have like the co-working

404
00:26:34,336 --> 00:26:38,051
room,right?Which is another like
little,almost like a little

405
00:26:38,051 --> 00:26:43,182
community inside our community.
Uh,and,um,I,and lots of people

406
00:26:43,182 --> 00:26:46,182
talk about the coworking room as
like one of the special things

407
00:26:46,182 --> 00:26:50,501
of,of virtual coffee.And um,uh,
Justin,one of our members just

408
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:56,261
did a,made a coworking room set
up,uh,for his,for his company,

409
00:26:56,321 --> 00:27:00,672
and,uh,was pretty excited about
that too,which,which is cool.And

410
00:27:01,493 --> 00:27:06,084
I guess what I wanna say is like,
the importance and the value of

411
00:27:06,114 --> 00:27:09,713
these sort of interactions,um,is
something that's hard to quantify

412
00:27:09,773 --> 00:27:14,094
and is something maybe hard to
explain,you know?Uh,but

413
00:27:14,153 --> 00:27:19,554
experiencing it,um,is something
different.And that's,that's one

414
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,653
thing that our community does
really well.And I think another

415
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:26,213
way that we sort of can to make
the greater world,you know,

416
00:27:26,364 --> 00:27:30,834
better,a better place for people
is,uh,is sharing this sort of

417
00:27:30,894 --> 00:27:35,423
interaction and,um,sharing this
process,you know,uh,and,and

418
00:27:35,574 --> 00:27:39,414
letting people in the world,uh,
try to practice it on their own.

419
00:27:40,414 --> 00:27:42,815
Bekah: Yeah,and I think that's
really important.I know that we

420
00:27:42,815 --> 00:27:46,535
talk a lot about there's a value
for community for every person,

421
00:27:46,535 --> 00:27:49,474
so we encourage a lot of people
to find the right community for

422
00:27:49,474 --> 00:27:53,884
them.Um,but then also
understanding that there's a

423
00:27:53,884 --> 00:27:57,305
value for community for the
entire industry.It benefits the

424
00:27:57,305 --> 00:27:59,884
industry when people find
community and a sense of

425
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,174
belonging.Um,because then they
can take what they learn in those

426
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,565
spaces and they can apply it to
where they are and the things

427
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:11,585
that they're doing.Um,the next
part of the culture citizenship

428
00:28:11,585 --> 00:28:14,825
definition that we have,I really
like it's as if you see someone

429
00:28:15,154 --> 00:28:18,095
who's making an extra effort to
ensure our community is

430
00:28:18,095 --> 00:28:21,634
welcoming,friendly,and encourages
all participants to contribute to

431
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:24,664
the fullest extent.Please
recognize their efforts.And that

432
00:28:24,664 --> 00:28:31,865
seems really nice because right
now,um,it is virtual coffee.Um,

433
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:36,710
Community Kindness month,I think
because this is,we've completed

434
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:39,589
our third year of virtual coffee.
We're moving into our fourth

435
00:28:39,589 --> 00:28:44,000
year,and that's one of those
things that,that positive,

436
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,960
recognizing the positive
interactions,recognizing the

437
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,160
people who are giving back,I
think is a really important part

438
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:57,740
of setting the tone for what a
good community looks like.Um,and

439
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,619
so,you know,we are very,very
thankful for all of the people

440
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:04,730
who volunteer at Virtual Coffee
in different capacities and who

441
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,759
provide feedback and who are
willing to talk us through

442
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:12,380
different discussions and have
challenging conversations with

443
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,829
us.Because I think that,you know,
even in the hard conversations,

444
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:18,230
there's a lot of beauty and
understanding that comes out of

445
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,990
that because we can work on
listening,we can work on

446
00:29:20,994 --> 00:29:23,750
accepting feedback,and we can
grow from that as well.

447
00:29:24,378 --> 00:29:27,301
Julia: Yeah,I think that it's
also kind of an important

448
00:29:27,455 --> 00:29:32,165
distinction maybe for people who
are newer to the community is

449
00:29:32,165 --> 00:29:36,281
part of,know,I haven't used Code
Mentor or one of those sort of

450
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:43,092
paid spaces before,but I think
it's really important to kind of

451
00:29:43,092 --> 00:29:46,842
continually recognize that
everybody who's part of VC is

452
00:29:46,846 --> 00:29:54,041
doing it.Because they wanna be
there and because it is bringing

453
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:59,925
value to them.but that we need to
not take that for granted,you

454
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:08,965
know?Um,it's really important to
acknowledge and show,you know,be

455
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:14,996
thankful,you know,act
proactively,kind of showing your

456
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:18,493
gratitude to people.yeah,I don't
know.I just,and I think about

457
00:30:18,824 --> 00:30:23,263
that particularly like with those
hard conversations that like,

458
00:30:23,294 --> 00:30:28,183
part of being part of a
community,it's like if you want

459
00:30:28,183 --> 00:30:34,653
it to be a better place,if you
want people to grow,sometimes

460
00:30:35,203 --> 00:30:39,898
you're gonna have to.Do a little
work to help people grow,right?

461
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:45,509
Like we grow through our
relationships with others.Um,

462
00:30:46,318 --> 00:30:50,128
but,and,and if you,and like if
you are on the receiving end of

463
00:30:50,128 --> 00:30:54,209
somebody else's emotional work,
like it's important to

464
00:30:54,213 --> 00:31:00,449
acknowledge that and thank them
for it and like be gracious about

465
00:31:01,348 --> 00:31:06,929
the work that they are investing
in you and in the community.Um,

466
00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:11,068
and I don't,I'm kind of rambling,
but I don't know.I just,I think

467
00:31:11,074 --> 00:31:15,602
that that's,um,it's something
that maybe is not immediately

468
00:31:16,551 --> 00:31:20,221
obvious how important that is.I
think.

469
00:31:20,885 --> 00:31:25,355
Kirk: Yeah.Um,like while we were
talking about this in sort of

470
00:31:25,355 --> 00:31:28,445
like the earlier point,you know,
like the difference between like

471
00:31:28,445 --> 00:31:35,385
hearing code mentors,um,it's
really important that like the

472
00:31:35,385 --> 00:31:38,266
intrinsic value of like being a
VC member is just like being a VC

473
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:41,266
member.Like this is a space where
you know,as much as possible,

474
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:46,006
like your worth is not determined
by like,how many lines of Python

475
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:50,266
you write or like your industry
experience or your job title,or

476
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:54,901
like,You know,any of that,you
know,like as a VC member,you are

477
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:58,770
like a whole and fully formed
person,and like you as a person

478
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,980
are the thing that like,makes you
like wonderful and valuable and

479
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:07,651
appreciated and like everything
else,sort of like,I don't know,

480
00:32:07,655 --> 00:32:12,211
the,the only sort of thing there
is that again,like coming back to

481
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:15,570
the code of conduct and like
trying to treat each other the

482
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,161
way we wanna be treated and like
willing to have these

483
00:32:17,161 --> 00:32:20,730
conversations and like,that's,
that's the gist of it.But,you

484
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,540
know,it's,it's one of the things
that I,I appreciate the most

485
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:26,881
about this community is that you
can come in this community sort

486
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:32,550
of wherever you are at.You know,
and in that,in that realm of like

487
00:32:32,941 --> 00:32:35,911
making an effort at like
stewardship and making an effort

488
00:32:35,911 --> 00:32:38,730
at empathy and making an effort,
like listening and understanding.

489
00:32:39,151 --> 00:32:43,998
And then you know,like there's no
VC member tier,you know what I

490
00:32:43,998 --> 00:32:49,278
mean?Like,um,And you're never
gonna like be evaluated here by

491
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,928
like your productivity or by,
like,that's,that's not the goal.

492
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,742
which is difficult to find like
in other tech spaces cuz they're

493
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,373
usually so hyper-focused on a
thing or a product or a tool or a

494
00:33:01,377 --> 00:33:03,803
lifestyle where you find yourself
like having these like

495
00:33:04,272 --> 00:33:06,893
architectures starting to be
assembled and then we end up in

496
00:33:06,893 --> 00:33:10,689
this place,which I think can be
really dangerous.Where like,um,I

497
00:33:10,693 --> 00:33:15,848
don't know the words like
culture,stewardship,community

498
00:33:15,878 --> 00:33:19,568
like,can fall by the wayside
because we go like,oh,well this

499
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:22,388
person's good at this,or this
person's like,been here for a

500
00:33:22,388 --> 00:33:26,618
long time.And I think one of the
things that like I try,I try like

501
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:29,378
more to challenge myself on is
like doing those objective

502
00:33:29,378 --> 00:33:35,098
moments of,you know,Because I've
been here for a long time,I have

503
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:38,159
so much context that comes with
me into like every single

504
00:33:38,163 --> 00:33:42,148
interaction and like finding ways
to step back and be like,oh,am I

505
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:46,439
actually making a good decision
here?Or is this like the weight

506
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:49,409
of my experiences,like pushing me
in one direction or another.And

507
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:52,409
then always trying to come back
to like,am I doing the best job

508
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:54,778
for all the people involved in
whatever's happening,including

509
00:33:54,778 --> 00:33:59,451
myself sometimes.but that's not a
one and done or that's not like a

510
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:04,132
Oh,okay,I've nailed
communication.I am done learning

511
00:34:04,612 --> 00:34:08,911
the end.that's never gonna
happen.And especially now,now

512
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:12,811
like membership is opening in,we
do have a constant cycle of new

513
00:34:12,811 --> 00:34:15,931
members coming in,returning
members coming in,different

514
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:20,400
people interacting in different
ways.And just like,it's really

515
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:26,295
important to always have the
rudder of.What's the thing I'm

516
00:34:26,295 --> 00:34:29,835
gonna try and use whenever I'm in
this space to try and like,make

517
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:32,925
it as good as possible for all
the people in this space.And

518
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:35,956
like,we always,like,always comes
back down to am I actually

519
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,626
listening to the other person?Am
I actually trying to understand

520
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:41,596
the perspective that they're
coming with?And like,am I willing

521
00:34:41,596 --> 00:34:47,505
to come in with the idea that
like my stance might not be the

522
00:34:47,505 --> 00:34:50,476
best stance or the appropriate
stance or like,I have something

523
00:34:50,476 --> 00:34:57,021
to learn here.You know?and that's
not easy,right?Like,that's not

524
00:34:57,021 --> 00:35:00,501
for free,that's not automatic.
Even though I think like we would

525
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:04,282
like it to be,it would be nice if
we could say,oh yeah,like my

526
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:07,762
empathy meter is always on max
and I'm doing great,but sometimes

527
00:35:07,762 --> 00:35:12,048
it's not.and that's just like
being people and I don't know,

528
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:14,329
going all the way back to the
start of this conversation,what

529
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:16,789
Julia was saying,like,that's,
that's why I'm here.I'm like here

530
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:20,733
to like practice being like a
person.Being a person means like

531
00:35:20,733 --> 00:35:24,753
also being a person when I really
don't wanna be,when I'd rather be

532
00:35:24,757 --> 00:35:27,842
like Chad,g p t,I never wanna be
like Chad,g p t,but you know,

533
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:33,195
Julia: when I was teaching high
school,I used to sometimes say

534
00:35:33,195 --> 00:35:36,255
that like,part of my job was
helping my students learn to be

535
00:35:36,255 --> 00:35:41,394
people.And not that they're not
people,but like,they're not fully

536
00:35:41,804 --> 00:35:47,804
realized people.And,uh,yeah,
sometimes I'd like to just be a

537
00:35:47,804 --> 00:35:52,065
teenager again and not have to
like be fully accountable for

538
00:35:52,065 --> 00:35:57,764
myself.But,um,the flip side of
that is that I think this and

539
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:01,454
this is part of what made VC so
valuable to me when I first

540
00:36:01,844 --> 00:36:06,559
joined the community.which was a
little more than two years ago,

541
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:12,521
is like,this is a place Where
people really are valued for

542
00:36:12,521 --> 00:36:18,371
their whole selves.Like,I found
so many opportunities to give,

543
00:36:18,701 --> 00:36:22,811
even when I was like a rank
beginner in the tech industry.

544
00:36:23,844 --> 00:36:31,164
there's still so much opportunity
to contribute and teach and share

545
00:36:31,164 --> 00:36:37,614
and,and help.you know,if you,if I
think the flip side of that is

546
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:43,344
like that we do want people to be
like fully accountable human

547
00:36:43,344 --> 00:36:47,784
beings.Like,not act like
teenagers.Not that there's

548
00:36:47,784 --> 00:36:50,494
anything wrong with teenagers,
but.

549
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:52,400
Dan: There's nothing wrong with
teenagers.

550
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:52,639
Julia: Yeah,

551
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,630
Kirk: As a former teenager,I can
say there are a lot of things

552
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,559
wrong with me as a teenager.

553
00:36:58,559 --> 00:36:58,679
Julia: they're

554
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:00,150
Kirk: wasn't terrible,but you
know.

555
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,170
Julia: That's what.

556
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:04,458
Bekah: Well,I think,you know,a,
as part of this idea of culture,

557
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:08,088
citizenship and all of the things
that we're talking about,and,uh,

558
00:37:08,094 --> 00:37:11,208
in some ways,like we're in our
toddlerhood at virtual coffee,

559
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:14,179
right?And so,like,we are still
growing and as the community

560
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:18,978
grows,things change,change,the
members grow.Um,there's new

561
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:22,516
perspectives,there's new,um,
things that you need to

562
00:37:22,516 --> 00:37:28,965
understand new,um,ideas that you
need to be sensitive to or,um,

563
00:37:30,346 --> 00:37:34,516
often good opportunities for
listening rather than responding,

564
00:37:34,905 --> 00:37:39,016
which is something that I can say
I'm working on.Um,and I'm better

565
00:37:39,016 --> 00:37:42,106
than when I first started.But,
you know,a lot of times there

566
00:37:42,556 --> 00:37:46,425
were things that I,I wanted to
react to immediately.And I think

567
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:51,360
like,you know,there's a,that
growth that you have as.There you

568
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:56,760
have to,you know,listen and,uh,
be willing to understand

569
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,851
different aspects of what people
are saying to you.And I think

570
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:04,831
that,um,that's really important
when we talk about this idea of

571
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:08,501
focusing on the impact of our
actions rather than our intent.

572
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:12,690
And I think that's one of those
things that can be really tricky

573
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:18,840
to understand.Um,does anybody
want to explain what that means?

574
00:38:20,061 --> 00:38:25,431
Kirk: I'll give it a try.Um,
yeah,no,I feel like this is,I

575
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,681
don't know,this is like one of
the most important things,as

576
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:31,521
Bekah said,like,we're,we're three
years in storming,norming,

577
00:38:31,521 --> 00:38:35,751
forming.What's the fourth one
performing?I can't remember.

578
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,740
There's a whole thing about it.I
did a class one.Um,but yeah,

579
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,880
there's,there's this being a
bunch of people in a space,being

580
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,400
a bunch of different people in a
space,being a bunch of different

581
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:55,400
people in a space where the like
boundaries are like,Good

582
00:38:55,405 --> 00:38:58,371
communication,like good
stewardship and all these things

583
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,940
inevitable,inevitably you end up
in a space where it's like,

584
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,851
sometimes I'm having
conversations or I maybe always

585
00:39:04,856 --> 00:39:07,280
be having conversations where I
probably think I'm right,but like

586
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,460
what happens if someone else
doesn't think I'm right?Right.

587
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:14,081
What happens if like most people
don't think I'm right or you

588
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:16,701
know,what happens if like someone
else is sing wrong,but I still

589
00:39:16,701 --> 00:39:21,710
think it.Right.And like trying
to,to navigate that.Um,and you

590
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,911
know,just like for,for context
before,it's like in,in our

591
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:30,981
language and whenever we talk
about official VC language,there

592
00:39:30,981 --> 00:39:33,681
are a couple things we always
want to establish.Like we always

593
00:39:33,681 --> 00:39:39,201
want to have our documentation
the way that like makes it clear.

594
00:39:40,356 --> 00:39:44,615
The values,like we're encouraging
people to like try and like

595
00:39:44,706 --> 00:39:49,012
inhabit like,but in a way that
doesn't try and like suppress

596
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:51,472
themselves,right?It's like,hey,
these are things that are good

597
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:56,422
for the group.And not in a way of
like trying to squeeze your

598
00:39:56,422 --> 00:39:59,632
behavior into some manner too,
but just like providing the

599
00:39:59,632 --> 00:40:03,773
guardrails to like just help a
community flourish.And,you know,

600
00:40:04,043 --> 00:40:09,023
I don't see online,like virtual
communities are very similar just

601
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:11,782
like I r L communities and the
fact that like you have to share

602
00:40:11,788 --> 00:40:14,902
spaces with people who may have
slightly different values in you,

603
00:40:14,963 --> 00:40:18,563
but you still have to kind of
make that work.Um,and yeah.Then

604
00:40:18,563 --> 00:40:21,172
getting back to sort of the
question of like actions and

605
00:40:21,172 --> 00:40:26,692
intent.sometimes or frequently I
feel like almost all the time,

606
00:40:26,692 --> 00:40:31,402
like we have good intent.Um,
there are very few people who

607
00:40:31,402 --> 00:40:33,231
come in with bad intent and one
thing I like about this

608
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:37,101
community,I can say like,I don't
know.I can count on one hand the

609
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,052
amount of times where I feel like
someone is coming into an

610
00:40:39,052 --> 00:40:43,851
interaction with bad intent.Uh,
but for whatever reason,the

611
00:40:43,851 --> 00:40:47,092
actual action,you know,like was
probably not like,received in the

612
00:40:47,092 --> 00:40:52,612
way that they expected it to.Uh,
and then what I tend to feel

613
00:40:52,612 --> 00:40:58,342
like,regardless of the side or
like where you are in that

614
00:40:58,342 --> 00:41:03,141
conversation,there's always an
opportunity for like,am I having

615
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:06,382
this conversation in a way that
like,gets me to what I want?And

616
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:09,081
typically the thing I want is
like,I want this other person to

617
00:41:09,081 --> 00:41:12,351
understand my perspective and be
able to receive where that's

618
00:41:12,351 --> 00:41:18,262
coming from.Um,and sometimes like
it's very easy to do yourself a

619
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:22,882
disservice in the way you do
that.Right.And I don't know,

620
00:41:22,882 --> 00:41:25,552
that's,that's usually like most
of the time that's where like

621
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:29,092
communication breaks down where
people either feel like I'm not

622
00:41:29,092 --> 00:41:34,146
being heard,uh,I'm not being
understood.Or sometimes like,I'm

623
00:41:34,146 --> 00:41:40,597
not being like empathized with
like,and I don't know,navigating

624
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:44,436
that I feel like is probably the
crux of human interaction,right?

625
00:41:44,436 --> 00:41:47,706
Like it's,it's the thing like we,
we try and teach each other all

626
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:52,987
the time and that willingness to
be like,I don't know if I agree

627
00:41:52,987 --> 00:41:58,056
with this person in this moment,
but you know,like I wanna have

628
00:41:58,056 --> 00:42:00,757
the conversation that like,
brings me closer to understanding

629
00:42:00,757 --> 00:42:04,237
where they're coming from.And
even if the ultimate idea at the

630
00:42:04,237 --> 00:42:07,206
end is that,like,I still don't
necessarily agree like what

631
00:42:07,211 --> 00:42:10,686
they're doing,but there's
probably a way to get like why

632
00:42:10,686 --> 00:42:12,847
they're doing it or like what are
the themes or what's going

633
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:16,476
through their mind as they're
doing it.Um,the other tricky

634
00:42:16,476 --> 00:42:18,817
thing that's been brought up a
lot of times cuz you know,

635
00:42:20,016 --> 00:42:24,097
especially.maintainers,like we
spend a lot of time just talking

636
00:42:24,097 --> 00:42:26,286
to members,right?Members come to
us and they tell us what's going

637
00:42:26,286 --> 00:42:29,706
on,and we always have this open
policy where you can always tell

638
00:42:29,706 --> 00:42:31,416
us like what you're feeling,what
you're thinking about

639
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:34,297
interactions,what are your
thoughts in this space,you know,

640
00:42:34,297 --> 00:42:38,137
like it's,I think like,like we
try and be a safe space always

641
00:42:38,137 --> 00:42:40,686
for people to share their
experiences and thoughts and

642
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:46,567
feelings.Um,a lot of times folks
will say like,I'm not sure if I

643
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,577
navigated this well or I'm not
sure if I did the right thing

644
00:42:48,577 --> 00:42:53,347
here.Um,or you know,like very
frequently,like most,you know,in

645
00:42:53,347 --> 00:42:56,347
the,in the coffees are on video
and we're speaking,but you know,

646
00:42:56,351 --> 00:42:58,896
a lot of VC communication happens
in the Slack and that's all text

647
00:42:58,896 --> 00:43:02,047
based and context is like super
hard when it's text-based,you

648
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:06,306
know,and the thing you sort of
never get is like a body language

649
00:43:06,306 --> 00:43:09,007
or people's emotional reactions
or just like where they're coming

650
00:43:09,007 --> 00:43:12,126
from from the day and there's a,
I don't know,there's a bunch of

651
00:43:12,126 --> 00:43:17,916
things in there and I feel like
it all boils down to we are

652
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:23,422
always going to be trying to say
things of good intent.Um,if that

653
00:43:23,422 --> 00:43:26,632
is received negatively,like
that's where like the actual

654
00:43:26,632 --> 00:43:30,592
conversation begins.Like,where do
we go from there and can we get

655
00:43:30,592 --> 00:43:33,742
this back to a good place?And
sometimes like,well,can I get

656
00:43:33,742 --> 00:43:37,402
this back to a good place alone?
Or maybe I need to ask for

657
00:43:37,402 --> 00:43:40,072
support.And that's another place
where the maintainers can like,

658
00:43:40,612 --> 00:43:46,311
be a great value and a great
asset,you know.Um,but always,

659
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:50,661
always,always this idea of,at
least for me,coming into every

660
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:57,742
conversation with the person I'm
talking to,um,is a good and

661
00:43:57,742 --> 00:44:05,271
wonderful person.They have like,
they have a need to communicate

662
00:44:05,331 --> 00:44:08,181
and like values that they want to
share and express and be

663
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:13,882
understood.And it is in my job,
like it is in like,it's kind of

664
00:44:13,887 --> 00:44:19,266
like,I don't know,for me,My duty
is one who wants to like keep

665
00:44:19,266 --> 00:44:24,007
this space as good as it is to
like recognize that and then use

666
00:44:24,007 --> 00:44:26,797
that as my lead into further
conversation.Even if the

667
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:31,686
conversation ends up being like,
Hey,this action like may not be

668
00:44:31,686 --> 00:44:35,527
in line with our community
standards,or,Hey,this response

669
00:44:35,527 --> 00:44:38,496
may not be in line of our
community standards,but it's

670
00:44:38,501 --> 00:44:39,967
never Yeah,go

671
00:44:40,007 --> 00:44:44,181
Julia: Hey,this response may not
be in line with like,Who,you

672
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:49,672
know,how you see yourself,right?
Like,and that,and that could be a

673
00:44:49,672 --> 00:44:55,012
hard thing to say to somebody
directly,but I think it's a,I

674
00:44:55,012 --> 00:44:57,822
think it's an important thing to
reflect on,right?That sometimes

675
00:44:59,092 --> 00:45:04,532
the things that we say and do,
like maybe aren't,maybe we,you

676
00:45:04,532 --> 00:45:09,601
know,I don't think we can expect
perfection out of anybody.I'm not

677
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:14,371
perfect,you know,like I've said
and done things that I'm like,oh

678
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:20,672
shoot.But like,part of it is
owning that.Like when you,when

679
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:26,342
you,you know,when somebody says,
Hey,that hurt.Um,being like,oh,

680
00:45:26,342 --> 00:45:31,981
sh well shoot,that was not my
plan.Like,you know,help me un you

681
00:45:31,981 --> 00:45:35,791
know,if,if you can help me
understand why that was hurtful,

682
00:45:35,882 --> 00:45:38,574
you know,if it's not immediately
obvious And that's kinda what I

683
00:45:38,574 --> 00:45:43,795
mean about like,if you want the
community to grow,like,you know,

684
00:45:43,885 --> 00:45:46,914
I,I know that part of the
conversation around like assume

685
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:53,784
good intent me maybe being not a
great standard is that it puts

686
00:45:53,784 --> 00:46:01,375
the burden on the person who is
like in a less powerful position.

687
00:46:02,592 --> 00:46:08,652
and so I think like the way to
maybe handle that to some extent

688
00:46:08,652 --> 00:46:16,693
is for,is for people who,whose
intent is being challenged to be

689
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:23,592
like,oh,like now is the time for
me to step back and like,and act,

690
00:46:23,623 --> 00:46:27,913
you know,and sort of actively
seek to remediate whatever harm I

691
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:32,893
might have caused.Like I.It's not
that we expect people to be a

692
00:46:32,893 --> 00:46:36,552
hundred percent perfect all the
time,it's that we expect people

693
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:40,427
to try to do better.and I just
like,in terms of simple

694
00:46:40,427 --> 00:46:43,217
strategies,one of the things I
really like that Bekah that you

695
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:46,878
do is that you'll,you'll say
like,I don't know what I think

696
00:46:46,878 --> 00:46:50,657
about this right now.Like,I'm
gonna think about this and come

697
00:46:50,657 --> 00:46:58,157
back to this.And like,we could
probably all stand to do that.I

698
00:46:58,163 --> 00:47:00,347
dunno,I did sort of cut you off.
I.

699
00:47:00,947 --> 00:47:04,818
Kirk: No,I,I think those points
were great.And yeah,like in a,

700
00:47:05,387 --> 00:47:09,197
sometimes in a time where it
feels like you're always expected

701
00:47:09,197 --> 00:47:14,088
to have a stance and a strong
stance and an immediate stance on

702
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:16,697
whatever topic become your way.I
do think it's very powerful

703
00:47:16,697 --> 00:47:21,378
sometimes to be like,I am not in
the place,or I am not ready to

704
00:47:21,378 --> 00:47:26,597
have this conversation yet.Um,
and just like gracefully allow

705
00:47:26,597 --> 00:47:30,257
yourself that time to kind of get
there.Uh,but yeah.The last thing

706
00:47:30,262 --> 00:47:32,538
I was just sort of thinking about
in like the context of all this,

707
00:47:32,898 --> 00:47:40,068
it kind of reminds me of exercise
in a weird way.Like in a sense

708
00:47:40,072 --> 00:47:47,958
like exercise is like being like
sometimes uncomfortable for the

709
00:47:47,958 --> 00:47:51,813
sake of like long term comfort.
You know,like when you finish

710
00:47:51,813 --> 00:47:54,873
doing like,like your muscles
hurt,your legs hurt.It's like,

711
00:47:54,963 --> 00:47:57,512
but it's acute.And like that is
assumed to be a good thing.Like

712
00:47:57,512 --> 00:48:00,932
in the general scheme,like that's
a good thing.Chronic pain is bad.

713
00:48:01,413 --> 00:48:04,233
So a lot of times when I think
about community interactions,you

714
00:48:04,233 --> 00:48:07,083
know,like what's going through my
head is not like,oh,there were no

715
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:09,563
uncomfortable conversations this
week.This was a good week.Right?

716
00:48:09,932 --> 00:48:14,822
Because that's not a,like,that's
not the right frame of mind.It's

717
00:48:14,822 --> 00:48:18,362
like,oh,we had some income from
conversations,but we navigated in

718
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,972
them and like got to a good
place.That feels good for me.

719
00:48:21,003 --> 00:48:24,092
Like that's like acute discomfort
that leads to long-term comfort

720
00:48:24,092 --> 00:48:26,943
because then like,we're now more
empowered to have those

721
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:30,916
conversations and everyone can
feel safe having like,I don't

722
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:32,987
know,and this,this is like a very
negative thought,but I always

723
00:48:32,987 --> 00:48:37,530
have this idea of like,
empowerment is like still feeling

724
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:41,670
safety in moments of discomfort,
you know?And like being able to,

725
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:46,844
to like dis like establish what
is like long-term chronic.Bad,

726
00:48:46,905 --> 00:48:49,934
and like moments of bad,I feel
like I can deal with this moment

727
00:48:49,934 --> 00:48:53,054
of bad,um,because the other
people around me,like we're all

728
00:48:53,054 --> 00:48:57,375
working together to get out of
this,you know,it's like being on

729
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,684
an island with a bunch of other
people or being on an island

730
00:48:59,744 --> 00:49:02,085
naked by yourself and pooping in
the water.You know,they're

731
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:07,159
fairly,they're very different.
but yeah,and that is,you know,

732
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:09,228
like,and the reason why the
maintainers,like what we're

733
00:49:09,228 --> 00:49:13,068
having this conversation now is
like,as we've just collected a

734
00:49:13,068 --> 00:49:15,289
bunch of like,surveys from the
members and we've been having all

735
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:18,679
these conversations really,
really,really like putting in the

736
00:49:18,684 --> 00:49:22,639
time into thinking about,um,how
we want the community to move

737
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:25,849
forward as a community.What does
good stewardship look like?What

738
00:49:25,849 --> 00:49:28,639
does support look like?What does
moderation look like?And all

739
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:31,639
these conversations kind of come
into play.And like,the big answer

740
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:37,938
is,it's hard and complicated,but
like,I.One of the pillars is if,

741
00:49:38,298 --> 00:49:42,108
for me at least,if we end up in a
place where when a difficult

742
00:49:42,108 --> 00:49:47,119
conversation happens,there's not
a moment of feeling like panic or

743
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,268
loss of control for the people
involved and like,okay,we're here

744
00:49:50,273 --> 00:49:53,809
now,but we can probably get out
of here in a good place.That's

745
00:49:53,809 --> 00:49:58,009
what feels good to me.Not a space
where no one ever does any

746
00:49:58,009 --> 00:50:00,768
difficult conversations,cuz I
don't think that's possible.

747
00:50:02,293 --> 00:50:04,643
Bekah: Yeah,and I think when that
happens,you're l.Using

748
00:50:04,643 --> 00:50:07,822
opportunities to grow,right?Like
you're settling for not being

749
00:50:07,822 --> 00:50:11,483
uncomfortable.And one of the
great things about being part of

750
00:50:11,483 --> 00:50:14,543
a supportive community is that
you have those opportunities to

751
00:50:14,547 --> 00:50:19,163
be uncomfortable.You can fail and
you can learn from that

752
00:50:19,168 --> 00:50:23,273
experience,right?You can ask for
forgiveness,you can ask for

753
00:50:23,452 --> 00:50:27,833
feedback and to grow.And so I
think that,yeah,sometimes it does

754
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:31,012
get exhausting having those hard
conversations,but like you're

755
00:50:31,012 --> 00:50:36,143
saying,the it is valuable to have
those hard conversations and to

756
00:50:36,143 --> 00:50:37,882
figure out how to work through
them.

757
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:44,028
Kirk: Yeah.And to,to your point,
just sort of like,also,one of the

758
00:50:44,034 --> 00:50:48,048
nice things about an online space
is like,again,a lot of times,

759
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:54,289
like you have the buffer to
choose when you want to opt in to

760
00:50:54,289 --> 00:50:57,934
like,I.There's not always a sense
of like,immediacy,even though

761
00:50:57,934 --> 00:51:00,994
that's how we feel,you know?
Like,and it's,it's okay to say,

762
00:51:00,994 --> 00:51:04,923
hey,like,well,I need to take a
step back right now.Um,not

763
00:51:04,923 --> 00:51:08,704
because this is unimportant,but
because this is important,you

764
00:51:08,704 --> 00:51:13,684
know?And I wanna like come back
when,when I can,like,when I can

765
00:51:13,684 --> 00:51:17,134
learn and grow from this as best
as I can and like I can like meet

766
00:51:17,134 --> 00:51:19,563
people where they are.And when I
can empathize for other people,

767
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:26,074
that's something I really want to
do.Um,and I'll,I'll say this

768
00:51:26,074 --> 00:51:29,704
conversation,I'll mention the
conversation I had once with my

769
00:51:30,063 --> 00:51:35,773
dad.My father as a interesting
man,but one time he was like,you

770
00:51:35,773 --> 00:51:39,643
know,Kirk,you and your brother
are so nice.You're such nice

771
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:44,324
guys.I'm not nice like you are.
And I was feeling not in my most

772
00:51:44,329 --> 00:51:47,264
empathetic place at that point in
time with my father.And I was

773
00:51:47,264 --> 00:51:52,708
like,no man.We just try to be
nice.Like we're not,there's

774
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:56,998
nothing magical about whatever is
is happening.You know,like it's

775
00:51:56,998 --> 00:52:03,155
just trying really hard sometimes
to like,even,even in the moments

776
00:52:03,155 --> 00:52:09,454
where I don't want to,still
trying to maybe do my best and if

777
00:52:09,454 --> 00:52:11,945
I can't do my best,I take five
minutes.I'm like,okay,maybe I can

778
00:52:11,945 --> 00:52:13,954
do it in five minutes and then
maybe I can do it in10minutes.

779
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,045
You're like,maybe I need to like
eat a sandwich first.Many times I

780
00:52:17,045 --> 00:52:21,394
need to eat a sandwich first.You
know,that it's not,it's not

781
00:52:21,394 --> 00:52:24,804
something that goes away.And I
think like if you sort of like

782
00:52:25,173 --> 00:52:28,483
never choose to go into those
moments,then you're kind of like

783
00:52:28,574 --> 00:52:31,994
opting out of some important
things.But also in the context of

784
00:52:31,994 --> 00:52:34,603
all of this,like we all have our
lived lives and we all have our

785
00:52:34,608 --> 00:52:39,344
traumas and we all have our
journeys.So it's also a thing

786
00:52:39,344 --> 00:52:42,764
that like,I never wanna like
force on anyone.I just want to

787
00:52:42,764 --> 00:52:47,172
say that like I would like this
community to be a space where it

788
00:52:47,172 --> 00:52:50,532
is a space where you can also do
those things,you know,and feel

789
00:52:51,192 --> 00:52:54,552
like even though it's hard in the
moment,it's gonna be like good in

790
00:52:54,552 --> 00:53:00,300
the long run.That is not what I
told my dad I was,I was,I had to

791
00:53:00,304 --> 00:53:00,920
apologize after.

792
00:53:02,478 --> 00:53:04,318
Bekah: I was gonna say that's a
really great way to end this

793
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:08,369
episode,but maybe it's still a
really great way.Apologies are

794
00:53:08,373 --> 00:53:13,599
important and useful too.Uh,does
anybody else want to wrap us up

795
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:14,599
in this conversation?

796
00:53:16,164 --> 00:53:20,393
Julia: I don't know.I'm just
imagining perks,like trying to

797
00:53:20,393 --> 00:53:26,244
say that.Try anyone trying to say
that to their father.Just I feel

798
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:30,264
like that's a tough dynamic.Um,
and,and that's like maybe

799
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:34,373
there're maybe there's a place
to,to wrap things up.Sometimes

800
00:53:34,373 --> 00:53:40,043
the dynamics between two given
people like are kind of rough

801
00:53:40,224 --> 00:53:47,213
and,you know,we're all here to,
to help you navigate and

802
00:53:48,606 --> 00:53:55,416
hopefully,you know,help people
see the,the good in each other.

803
00:53:55,416 --> 00:54:01,878
And,so I'm from a very quiet
family.I don't know.We're just

804
00:54:01,878 --> 00:54:08,351
not,we do a lot of not talking
and,my partner's family is the

805
00:54:08,351 --> 00:54:14,740
opposite.And I very,I,I remember
the first time I like went to

806
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:22,210
visit with their whole family
there and it was like there was

807
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:25,721
one piece of chicken left after
everybody had eaten and it was

808
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:30,130
like,Oh my God.People are gonna
come to blows over a chicken

809
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:36,132
thigh,like,what is going on?and I
was like,I was really stressed

810
00:54:36,253 --> 00:54:38,983
and I was like,oh my God,I can't,
I can't handle this.Like I'm

811
00:54:38,983 --> 00:54:43,574
getting indigestion.Um,and
afterward,and I kind of,I was

812
00:54:43,574 --> 00:54:46,273
like,you guys,you guys like,it's
gonna be okay.There's more to

813
00:54:46,273 --> 00:54:50,322
eat.And people were looking at me
like,there was something wrong

814
00:54:50,322 --> 00:54:56,443
with me.Like,why is she reacting
this way to like,what was for

815
00:54:56,443 --> 00:55:00,793
them a very ordinary conversation
about who,who had the right to

816
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:05,023
the last piece of chicken.And
like,there's no right way or

817
00:55:05,023 --> 00:55:10,077
wrong way to communicate in that
situation.and like sometimes

818
00:55:10,077 --> 00:55:12,777
you're gonna get freaked out by
the way other people communicate.

819
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:16,831
And it doesn't mean they're bad
people and it doesn't mean

820
00:55:16,836 --> 00:55:21,451
they're actually going to come to
blows over a piece of chicken.

821
00:55:22,447 --> 00:55:24,608
and it doesn't mean that they
think there's anything wrong with

822
00:55:24,608 --> 00:55:32,599
your communication style either.
curiosity is really powerful.and

823
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:35,869
I think in those moments where
you like,feel a little

824
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:41,148
apprehension about other people,
like it's good to try to turn

825
00:55:41,148 --> 00:55:43,759
that apprehension into some
curiosity.And,

826
00:55:45,449 --> 00:55:51,130
Kirk: That's the new podcast name
not sent to my dad.Um,can I do

827
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:54,954
like one more call to action
maybe.Um,yeah.So like one last

828
00:55:54,954 --> 00:55:58,981
thing,you know,as we're,it's like
if you're listening and like any

829
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:02,190
of this seems interesting to you
or important to you or valuable

830
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:05,440
to you,again,like just super
encouraging everyone,reach out to

831
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,201
us,reach out to the maintainers.
We're always looking for feedback

832
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:11,650
from members.Um,we're always
happy to talk.I'm always happy to

833
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:17,050
talk.And you know,like we're,
we're really trying to like,in

834
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:20,501
the idea that like we will
constantly,like we will never

835
00:56:20,505 --> 00:56:23,771
stop trying to improve these
things and make them better.So

836
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:26,411
we're always open to hearing what
people have to say.So it is never

837
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:28,240
too late.Like,don't,like give,
missed your chance,what the

838
00:56:28,391 --> 00:56:30,721
surveys are done to like,talk to
us.You can always talk to us and

839
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,641
just let us know.And every single
piece of feedback from any member

840
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:38,135
here helps us,uh,make this a
better space.and my actual final

841
00:56:38,135 --> 00:56:41,885
thing is,Julia,that attitude of
your is over.That chicken is not

842
00:56:41,885 --> 00:56:44,255
gonna help you on the desert
island.You need

843
00:56:44,271 --> 00:56:45,590
Julia: But I'm by myself.

844
00:56:46,865 --> 00:56:49,896
Kirk: are you really?There's
dangers out there.

845
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:56,702
Julia: I think I'm by myself.
Bekah,am I by myself?

846
00:56:56,782 --> 00:57:01,190
Bekah: Um,maybe there are
alligators,I guess.

847
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:06,800
Dan: Just,just don't drink,don't
drink the water on the east side

848
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,280
of the island.

849
00:57:07,409 --> 00:57:09,248
Julia: eat with your left hand.
That's

850
00:57:09,788 --> 00:57:12,847
Bekah: Well,thanks everybody for
