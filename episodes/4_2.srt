00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:07,213
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 4, Episode 2

2
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:09,223
of the

3
00:00:09,223 --> 00:00:11,342
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

4
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:13,461
that

5
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:17,452
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

6
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:18,876
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

7
00:00:18,876 --> 00:00:20,300
their

8
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:23,271
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

9
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:24,891
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

10
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,511
it with

11
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:29,692
you. Here with me today is my
cohost, Dan.

12
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:32,539
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. Today
we're joined by Todd Libby. Todd

13
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:34,324
is a

14
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:37,804
web developer, designer, and
accessibility advocate. And he's

15
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:41,104
been doing it for over 20 years.
He's currently an accessibility

16
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:44,225
engineer at WebstaurantStore.
And he's also a member of the

17
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:46,624
Worldwide Web Consortium — also
known as W3C — doing work

18
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:49,023
updating their --

19
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:53,104
the web content accessibility
guidelines. Todd also hosts a

20
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:55,804
podcast called Front End
Nerdery. So once you're done

21
00:00:55,804 --> 00:00:58,125
listening to this episode, head
over there, and give that one a

22
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:01,445
listen. We had a great time
talking with Todd and hearing

23
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:02,839
about his long journey in tech,
how and why he developed a

24
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:04,233
career

25
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:07,685
focusing on accessibility, and
shared with us about what

26
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:10,685
accessibility means to him and
what kinds of things all

27
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:12,814
developers can do to ensure
their work is accessible by

28
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:14,943
everyone. I

29
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:15,905
know you're going to enjoy it.

30
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:26,676
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast like we start every

31
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:30,605
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

32
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:32,700
we're from, what we do, and a
random check-in question.

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,795
Today's

34
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:40,215
question is, what famous artist,
dead or alive, what'd you want

35
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:45,813
to paint your portrait. We hope
you enjoy this episode. My name

36
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:49,575
is Bekah. I am a front-end
developer from a small town in

37
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:53,337
Ohio. And if

38
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,509
I could have one person paint my
portrait, I -- when I was in

39
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,684
college, Georgia, there was like
big Georgia O'Keeffe paintings

40
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:01,769
or

41
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,478
replicas in the hallways of my
department. And I always loved

42
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,700
them. And I know that's not what
-- she doesn't paint

43
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,808
people, but I think

44
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:16,038
it would be cool to see how I
would be represented by her. So

45
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:17,329
I'm gonna go with Georgia
O'Keeffe.

46
00:02:19,144 --> 00:02:22,573
Dan: Hi, I'm Dan. I'm a
front-end developer in

47
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:24,002
Cleveland, Ohio.

48
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:27,693
And ... does it have to be
famous person?

49
00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:28,463
Bekah: Did I say famous?

50
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:29,403
Dan: I -- it said famous in the
question. But --

51
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:30,968
Bekah: Oh, I did. But, no. Like,
just take it out. Just --

52
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:33,393
Dan: I- I mean, Kate, one of my
good friends at Kate Brideau

53
00:02:33,393 --> 00:02:35,432
from

54
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:39,033
college, I would say that would
be the person. That'd

55
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,213
be famous. I don't- I don't
really know a lot of famous

56
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:44,700
painter names. I mean, except
for, like, the really famous

57
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,300
ones, you know?

58
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,503
And that seems like a boring
answer. Maybe I have Raphael,

59
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:54,000
but not the- not the artist. The
ninja turtle to my- to my-

60
00:02:53,614 --> 00:02:54,204
Bekah: Or my- my
[unintelligible].

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,500
Dan: -version. Yeah. [Laughs]
Well, it's -- well, sure.

62
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,300
There's- there's that too.

63
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,563
Yeah. A-any Raphael, really.
I'll take- take any version.

64
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:00,443
Bekah: Sounds like a good choice
[laughs].

65
00:03:05,588 --> 00:03:09,818
Todd Libby: And I'm Todd Libby.
I am a front-end developer and

66
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:12,893
accessibility engineer,
currently in Phoenix, Arizona.

67
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:15,968
And I guess

68
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:25,429
my artist would be ... I dunno.
He- he was really ... unique. So

69
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:27,868
I guess I would say Salvador
Dali.

70
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:29,519
Bekah: Mm. That's cool.

71
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:30,258
Dan: That'd be a good one.

72
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:32,853
Bekah: There's -- anytime
somebody is from Phoenix, I

73
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:34,257
think

74
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:36,268
of a short story that I read
from Sherman Alexie. "This Is

75
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:38,278
What It

76
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:41,998
Means To Say Phoenix, Arizona."
And I remember nothing about the

77
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:43,618
short story, except for the
title. And it's just,

78
00:03:43,618 --> 00:03:45,238
automatically,

79
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,459
that what comes into my mind. So
if you haven't read it, check

80
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,679
it out

81
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,179
and then remind me what it was
about.

82
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:55,028
Todd: I haven't, but I- I will
look that up, definitely. I'm

83
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:58,688
originally from Portland, Maine.
So of course everybody knows me

84
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:00,549
because of the lobster roll
thing. So --

85
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:05,514
Bekah: Yes. Todd is all about
the lobsters and in our Virtual

86
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:10,883
Coffee Slack, he always uses the
lobster emoji to respond to

87
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,608
people. And so we just
automatically recognize that

88
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:14,333
it's

89
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:18,444
Todd. So it's like he- he has
claimed that emoji and it's one

90
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:19,553
of the greatest things ever.

91
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,000
Dan: Yeah. It's- it's really
cool. And it's just like, you

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,803
see the lobster

93
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:25,500
emoji pop up, you're like, "Oh,
cool. Todd's here." Excellent

94
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,093
[all laugh].

95
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:30,417
Bekah: I just think it's funny.
Like, when- when new people

96
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:33,538
come into Virtual Coffee and
then they also click the lobster

97
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:34,069
emoji. So --

98
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:36,000
Dan: I mean, I always click it.
I- I mean-

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,300
Bekah: You do?

100
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,500
Dan: I don't do it first. You
know what I mean? But like, I'm

101
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,700
-- it's- it's like high fiving
Todd, you know? It's like-

102
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,000
Todd: Yeah.

103
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,559
Dan: -celebrating the- the- the
Toddness of- of it.

104
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:46,343
Todd: The virtual- virtual high
five [laughs].

105
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:47,459
Dan: [Laughs] That's right.

106
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:48,983
Bekah: Right. And it can be
a-about all sorts of different

107
00:04:48,983 --> 00:04:50,118
things.

108
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,874
Like, somebody could post a- a
question that they have, and

109
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,629
then

110
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:56,000
like, there's a lobster emoji
[chuckles]. It's not about

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,300
lobster. Although, if I had a
question about lobster, I would

112
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,658
definitely ask Todd first.

113
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:04,494
Todd: [Chuckles] I've got a
million no one answers.

114
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,048
Bekah: I feel like that's a
separate podcast episode.

115
00:05:08,048 --> 00:05:08,168
Todd: Yes.

116
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:09,189
Dan: Does it [unintelligible]?

117
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:13,000
Bekah: Thank you so much for
being here with us, Todd.

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,500
Todd: Thank you.

119
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Bekah: We always like to start
with the origin story. How did

120
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,588
you get to

121
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:22,309
where you are today? So, if you
wanna take us through that

122
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:22,488
path, that would be awesome.

123
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:27,173
Todd: Yeah. Oh, boy. That's a
long one. I'll give you the

124
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:32,824
abridged version. Nine years
old, I started on a Commodore

125
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:38,463
PET in school. And then
gradually worked my way up to a

126
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,848
Commodore 64, where I learned
BASIC, a lot of different

127
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:43,233
flavors

128
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:50,343
of BASIC, and was just, you
know, it was just a hobby of

129
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:55,803
course at that point. But ...
what was it? About 1999, I had

130
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:08,500
a .... what was it? A 386
desktop IBM computer. And I

131
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,139
started to

132
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:15,167
learn HTML. And this was before
CSS. So that is the indication

133
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:23,178
of how old I am. And JavaScript
was just kicking around. I

134
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:25,323
started learning how to design
websites using Front Page

135
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:27,468
Express

136
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:35,103
in Internet Explorer 3 and 4.
And just, it- it went from

137
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:44,733
there. Programming was cool. I
used to do ... in BASIC on a

138
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:49,564
Commodore, I would program — if
anybody remembers those "Choose

139
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:52,700
Your Own Adventure" books from
way back in the day-

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,300
Dan: Oh, yeah.

141
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,454
Todd: -I u- I used to

142
00:06:54,454 --> 00:07:01,863
program a text-based ... pretty
much copying [??], and I hope no

143
00:07:01,863 --> 00:07:06,500
one's listening from that
company, but [laughs], I- I used

144
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,700
to, just to- to just practice.

145
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,399
I would just, you know, code
those books into a- into a

146
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:18,468
text-based game on Commodore 64.
And that's really what got me

147
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:22,249
started because I was living in
a very rural area in- in New

148
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:28,009
England. And there wasn't much
to do, so -- except for

149
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:34,488
programming at that point. So,
skip ahead to today, or when I

150
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:40,548
started professionally and I was
22 years ago. And I started,

151
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:44,689
I read Jeffrey Zeldman's book
"Designing with Web Standards",

152
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:47,000
instantly got hooked into-

153
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,000
Dan: Yes.

154
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,788
Todd: -web standards,
progressive

155
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:52,038
enhancement accessibility. And
it just, you know, took off to

156
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,288
the

157
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:59,449
point where it is today, where
I'm in the- the field that I

158
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,478
enjoy being in, and that's
accessibility.

159
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:06,000
Dan: I think that's awesome. I
-- and I- I love that book

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
too. And Jeffery Zeldman
[laughs]. I- I have been -- so

161
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,500
22 years ago is what? 99, 2000,
something like that, you know?

162
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,478
And I- I think I got into -- I
mean, I was

163
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:21,748
starting to make something
around then and really kinda got

164
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:24,018
a lot more

165
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:27,588
into it a couple of years later.
But was with the web

166
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:28,713
standards, you know, movement
and everything like that. And

167
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:29,838
I've

168
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:31,953
been, you know, and similarly
front-end focused for

169
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:34,068
a long

170
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,859
time. And one of us was -- just
one of the reasons I was very

171
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:39,700
excited to have you on this
podcast and just to kinda get

172
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,288
to- get to hang out with a
little bit more.

173
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:42,438
Todd: Yeah.

174
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:48,700
Dan: It's a -- so, you know,
focusing on front end and

175
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,428
focusing on

176
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:54,303
accessibility, things like that,
what -- I mean, what career

177
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:56,313
opportunities has that, like,
presented to you from, you know,

178
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:58,700
starting -- I mean, you don't
need to, like, list every single

179
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,073
one or

180
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:01,433
whatever. But, like, run- run us
through a little bit of how-

181
00:09:01,443 --> 00:09:04,700
how that's been being like, a- a
front end, and especially

182
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,333
accessibility, you know,

183
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:08,734
specialist, for whatever that
means for- [chuckles] for you,

184
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:11,104
you know?

185
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:12,163
Run it through a little bit,
like, how that's been finding-

186
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:13,202
finding

187
00:09:13,744 --> 00:09:14,973
work and finding people that
care about that sort of thing?

188
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:20,259
Bekah: Can I just jump into, if
you can just provide some

189
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:24,500
context for what- what does
accessibility mean and how does

190
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,048
that work as part of a job?

191
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:33,109
Todd: Okay. To address what it's
accessibility mean, I'll- I'll

192
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:38,708
address that first. And that is
making the web equal and

193
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:42,634
accessible for everybody. It
just doesn't have to be a

194
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:44,989
disability. It can be, you know,
somebody in -- I'll use this

195
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:47,344
example.

196
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:50,763
In a very rural area who has a
3G phone, and, you know, it's

197
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:53,853
not a

198
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:57,484
very fast connection is to, you
know, what we have these days

199
00:09:57,484 --> 00:10:04,714
with our shiny new iPhones and
stuff like that. And then

200
00:10:04,714 --> 00:10:08,300
accessibility -- well,
so-somebody in accessibility

201
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,188
would basically,

202
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:16,038
not only advocate, but don't --
in my daily routine of doing

203
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:22,639
auditing on websites, it's just
checking to see if sites are

204
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,619
accessible if they're, you know,
if they should be failing

205
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:32,239
Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines — WCAG is how I

206
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,843
pronounce it. There's many
different pronunciations to

207
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,388
that.

208
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:46,489
But [laughs] the, you know --
and you know, there's different,

209
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:54,749
I guess, levels of how people
will do an audit. Like, you

210
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:59,700
know, you can do the, you know,
A and AA as far as the levels.

211
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,538
So there's A,

212
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:06,058
AA, and AAA. A lot of people I
find don't do AAA because it's

213
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:08,593
too stringent and it's also, you
don't have to go that far in

214
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:11,128
most

215
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:17,224
cases. But it's just auditing,
making sure sites are

216
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:22,984
accessible in creating a report
for a client and then

217
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:25,098
telling them, "Here's what's
wrong. Here's how you need to

218
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:27,153
fix it.

219
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:32,553
This doesn't, you know, adhere
to the guidelines and

220
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:37,803
recommendations for best
practices as well." And, you

221
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:40,953
know, looking at code and, you
know, always looking at HTML and

222
00:11:40,953 --> 00:11:46,594
CSS because CSS too has a strong
effect on accessibility. And

223
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:51,464
that's what the job entails. And
Dan, what was your question?

224
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:53,463
Dan: Alright. I guess my
question was, you know,

225
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,557
it's- it's a

226
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:57,568
sort of -- I don't know if
non-traditional is the right

227
00:11:57,568 --> 00:12:00,000
word, but, you know, a- a sp-
being a specialist really, in

228
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,163
any regard, is a- is a choice,
you know, and can limit your

229
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:05,248
options,

230
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:09,208
but like, also, you doing what
you wanna do, right? And so I

231
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:13,048
wa- my question was more like,
how has it been, on your career

232
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:15,568
journey, you know, being a
specialist, especially in the

233
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,948
accessibility world?

234
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:22,543
Todd: Right. It's been a
challenge lately in, I would say

235
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:30,793
the past five, maybe 10 years.
Because not a lot of people,

236
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,464
not a lot of companies were
looking for accessibility

237
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:39,764
specialists. Not until ... I've
pretty much noticed this year, a

238
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:43,333
lot of companies are now looking
for accessibility specialists

239
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:47,668
because companies are getting
sued. And they don't wanna get

240
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:53,908
sued. That's- that's the bottom
line. So my professional journey

241
00:12:53,908 --> 00:13:00,239
had been, I worked -- I started
-- I did a website for

242
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:07,769
somebody I knew back in New
England, Maine. And, it was

243
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:10,288
just a small site. And then from
there, I got, you know, a few

244
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:12,807
different

245
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,859
jobs doing websites. And then
from there, I was like, "Well,

246
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:18,794
you know, this thing's taken
off. I'm gonna do the f- I'm

247
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:20,739
gonna go

248
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:31,903
the freelance route." So that's
what I did. And up until 2015,

249
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:36,644
I was a freelance developer, I
guess, you could say. I got into

250
00:13:36,644 --> 00:13:42,313
WordPress, PHP development, and
then, I was hired by a

251
00:13:42,313 --> 00:13:51,403
company to do their website and
their SaaS- their SaaS

252
00:13:52,663 --> 00:14:01,124
site, I guess. It was a- a thing
where you log in and it wasn't a

253
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:12,043
public facing site. And from
there, it would b-been about, I

254
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:14,368
don't know. I think I counted
over 2000 resumes that I had

255
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:16,693
sent out

256
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:23,323
to companies in 20 years, and
one company hired me. And that

257
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:28,994
was that company that I worked
for in 2015 to ... just

258
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:34,033
last year, as a matter of fact.
And then finally somebody took a

259
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:36,823
chance on me. That would have
been Nobility. I was hired by

260
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:43,903
Nobility in March- i-in March or
April. Geez, it's been over

261
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:46,033
six months. But [laughs] --

262
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:47,818
Dan: What is time anyway?

263
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:49,888
Todd: Yeah. Well, I don't even
know [laughs] anymore. I'm in a

264
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:51,358
different time

265
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:57,928
zone now, so that's messed me up
too [laughs]. But Nobility gave

266
00:14:57,928 --> 00:15:02,458
me a, you know, an opportunity
and very grateful for that

267
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:09,178
opportunity with them. And a lot
of great people in Nobility

268
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,238
that work for the company.
Everybody is a matter of fact.

269
00:15:12,238 --> 00:15:15,268
And

270
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:17,578
they do some really good stuff
as far as accessibility goes.

271
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:19,858
And

272
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:28,336
as of October 1st, I will be on
the WebstaurantStore

273
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:32,677
team as an accessibility
engineer. So I look forward

274
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:34,000
to that. Yeah.

275
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,366
Dan: Awesome.

276
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:37,506
Bekah: Can- can you talk a
little bit about what you'll be

277
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:39,500
doing in that role there? Maybe
dive into a little bit of

278
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:39,756
details?

279
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:46,251
Todd: For right now, all I know
is it's basically doing the

280
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:52,192
same thing I do now, and that's
auditing their product for

281
00:15:52,192 --> 00:16:04,251
their website. I know they use-
they use React and I think

282
00:16:04,282 --> 00:16:10,042
it was .NET. So that -- I'll be
in that environment.

283
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:13,182
Bekah: So, like, when you do an
audit, where do you start with

284
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:13,272
that?

285
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:21,471
Todd: So, when I do an audit, I
do automated checks and scans

286
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:27,772
first. So I use stuff like the
WAVE extension, the Axe, I

287
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:32,601
now wait until the end to use
the axe-core extension in the

288
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:40,297
browser. Things, like, there's a
command line called

289
00:16:40,297 --> 00:16:48,726
Pa11y. So it's P-A-1-1-Y.
There's that. I use -- does

290
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:55,057
Bookmarklets from Ian Lloyd and
Paul J. Adam that I use, to also

291
00:16:55,326 --> 00:17:01,206
do checks. Let's see. What else?
There's Microsoft

292
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:07,267
Accessibility Insights, which is
a great tool to use. What

293
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:15,517
else? And ... I said Axe --
color contrast checks. I use the

294
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:19,626
Firefox accessibility dev tools,
the accessibility panels, and

295
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:26,196
those. And then I move on to
manual testing. So, mouse only,

296
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:33,112
keyboard only. I will do, it --
which goes back to color

297
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:35,842
contrast, I'll do the squint
test. So I'll just look at the

298
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:39,352
site while I'm squinting at it
and see if, you know, I can make

299
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:45,951
out anything, cuz that I was
taught not too long ago. So ...

300
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:46,551
and --

301
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:49,626
Dan: I like that.

302
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:52,701
Todd: Oh, screen readers. I will
use screen readers. So for Mac,

303
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:58,192
there's VoiceOver. And it's best
to use VoiceOver in Safari

304
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:05,332
because the native, you know,
Mac app and everything. NVDA

305
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:14,810
and JAWS on a Windows. And if —
and it's very, very rare — but

306
00:18:14,811 --> 00:18:21,067
if somebody says, "Oh, you know,
we have Linux users." So I will

307
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:27,845
test on what -- and it's called
Orca for Linux, and, yeah. Those

308
00:18:27,846 --> 00:18:33,500
are pretty much, if I remember
them all correctly [laughs].

309
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,236
Those are the tools I use.

310
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:38,366
Dan: That's -- yeah. That's
awesome. It's very extensive. I

311
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:39,926
was just writing all them down
so that, you know --

312
00:18:39,997 --> 00:18:42,176
Bekah: So was I. Well, the link
to those notes on show notes.

313
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:44,136
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. And so-
so like day to day -- I mean, I

314
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:45,801
know

315
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:47,661
you haven't started yet, but
like, in your- in your role,

316
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,521
will it be

317
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:53,541
mostly doing audits after the
fact? Or like, will you be

318
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,876
interfacing with, you know, I'm
not sure what they do, what

319
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:56,211
they --

320
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:59,092
what- what they make or anything
like that. But, you know, like,

321
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:03,142
where in the process are you-
are you doing like

322
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,336
accessibility, you know, helping
the team with- with this stuff?

323
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:10,446
Like, you know, audits for me
imply -- and I know this is not

324
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:13,537
always true, but when I- I think
of it as something, "Oh,

325
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:15,000
something's done, now we do an
audit on it. You know what I

326
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,172
mean?

327
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,000
Todd: Mm-hmm.

328
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,300
Dan: But I was wondering it --
and that I'm sure that's an

329
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,936
important part. I was

330
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:21,066
wondering if there's places
earlier in the process where-

331
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:28,386
where, you know, you're able to
interface and like, you know,

332
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:31,747
make suggestions before it, you
know, as opposed to like fixing

333
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:34,000
things, but like, help build
something, you know-

334
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Todd: Right. Yeah.

335
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,277
Dan: -the first time. Does that
make sense?

336
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:42,946
Todd: Yeah. Yeah. I'm- I'm sure
it's gonna be ... probably a- a

337
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:49,096
lot of both. Maybe there's
existing things on the site

338
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:56,416
that need to be checked,
components that may be being

339
00:19:56,416 --> 00:20:00,000
worked on that we'll have to be
checked. I mean, that's that --

340
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
it's that way pretty much with
any kind of audit. So I've had

341
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,731
companies come

342
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:07,946
to me and say, you know, "We --
we've got somebody who emailed

343
00:20:07,946 --> 00:20:11,151
us and

344
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:13,806
said, 'This isn't accessible, so
we need a -- an audit done.'"

345
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:16,460
And I'll

346
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:20,287
go through the site and say,
"Okay, I found all this. Here's

347
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:23,500
what you need to do to fix it."
They'll fix it, you know?

348
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,757
That'll be after

349
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:28,146
the fact of course. I've had
companies come in and ask me to

350
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:31,386
do consulting with their teams
before the project starts to

351
00:20:31,386 --> 00:20:34,626
make

352
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:37,567
sure that it gets done
beforehand. Because when you do

353
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:40,836
an accessibili- when you- when
you bring in accessibility from

354
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:45,146
the start of a project, it's so
much easier and there's less --

355
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:50,416
a lot less stress doing it from
the very beginning. Because when

356
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,957
you get to the end and you've
got everything is as accessible

357
00:20:53,957 --> 00:20:58,336
as you can, and I'll add that
nothing's a hundred percent

358
00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:05,537
accessible, it's- it's a lot
easier on your teams, you know?

359
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,700
Like I said, there's a lot less
stress. You don't have to go

360
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,000
back and, you know,

361
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,237
scatter around, trying to fix
this, that, and the other thing

362
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:17,826
after the fact. So -- and that's
also where my advocacy

363
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:21,500
comes in is saying, "Okay, if
you get this done from the

364
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,616
start, you're gonna be -- it's
gonna be so much easier. And

365
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:30,000
it's gonna cost less money
because you're not going back.

366
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,426
It's gonna cause a lot less
stress." Again. And those are

367
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:37,000
the two main things, you know?

368
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,300
But to answer the question, it's
gonna be a little bit of both.

369
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And I would think -- because
like I said, it's usually that

370
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,906
way at the beginning, you know?

371
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:47,346
Dan: Right. Get something to a
baseline first.

372
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:51,000
Todd: Yeah. Yeah. And I'll --
and- and it's still re-re-really

373
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,807
early in the

374
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:56,700
process, so I'm- I'm not too
sure. But I know that it'll

375
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,567
be a lot of,

376
00:21:57,626 --> 00:22:00,746
you know, checking to make sure
everything's good on the end

377
00:22:00,746 --> 00:22:03,866
of,

378
00:22:04,346 --> 00:22:07,047
you know, before we put this
out, we need to make sure it's

379
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:09,416
accessible. So --

380
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,311
Dan: Yeah.

381
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:12,051
Bekah: As you've been working
through this industry, do you

382
00:22:12,051 --> 00:22:18,307
think -- is there one problem
that you keep encountering over

383
00:22:18,307 --> 00:22:22,356
and over? Like stand out issues,
things that people can just

384
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:25,656
really look at and say, "All
right. Let's start here."

385
00:22:26,352 --> 00:22:31,500
Todd: Well, where do I begin?
[Laughs] I-it -- that -- it's-

386
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,500
it's a lot. But the mainly, it's
color contrast-

387
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,000
Bekah: Mm.

388
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Todd: -okay? That's the biggest
one. And keyboard accessibility

389
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,256
is another. And I'll throw in a
third one. And that being ALT

390
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:55,000
text on images — the alternative
text.

391
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:07,217
I've had, you know, a lot of --
ALT text can be a tricky- a

392
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:11,747
tricky thing because people
think, "Well, I have this image.

393
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:19,477
And I need to really go into
detail what that image is

394
00:23:19,477 --> 00:23:21,711
conveying, if it's an
informative image." And you

395
00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:23,945
really don't -- just a

396
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:31,146
short, you know, it's a purple
flower in a field, is- is fine.

397
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:34,700
You don't have to go into --
I've- I've seen on Twitter,

398
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,700
because they give you a thousand
characters for ALT text. And

399
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,892
I've seen this [laughs] -- I've
seen ALT text that long before.

400
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:43,700
Bekah: I always wonder, like,
I've -- I, like, I don't think

401
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,511
I've written enough,

402
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:49,082
because I'm not even close to
the 1000 and I have a thousand

403
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:49,531
to write [Todd laughs].

404
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:50,731
Dan: Yeah. I always-

405
00:23:50,731 --> 00:23:51,000
Todd: Yeah, you --

406
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,836
Dan: -try to just like- like --
just say the joke or what -- I

407
00:23:53,836 --> 00:23:54,961
mean, usually, if I'm posting an
image, it's a joke, you know?

408
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:55,700
But like-

409
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,000
Todd: Right.

410
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:59,700
Dan: -whatever the shortest
version of the joke is, you know

411
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,136
[laughs]? So I, like,

412
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:03,287
posted one today and it was just
like, "Guy's saying thumbs up,"

413
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:05,267
or something like that, you
know? You know what I mean?

414
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:05,416
Todd: Yeah.

415
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,111
Dan: Like, that seem if -- to
me, that at least seems, like,

416
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:09,436
usually, enough. I don't need to
give the whole --

417
00:24:09,436 --> 00:24:09,557
Todd: Yeah.

418
00:24:09,557 --> 00:24:11,656
Bekah: Sometimes I just don't
post because I don't know how to

419
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:15,856
describe it. Like, "Well, I'm
not really sure that I know how

420
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:19,336
to say and capture what this is
doing. So we'll go- we'll go for

421
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:19,936
something else."

422
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:23,300
Todd: Yeah. There's- there's a
lot of debate around how long

423
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,297
should it be. It

424
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:27,116
should be 180 characters. Should
it be a certain amount of

425
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:31,646
words, but just as long as it
conveys in a short succinct

426
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:39,086
sentence? I guess, that's fine.
And of course, you have some

427
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:43,287
images decorative that, ya know,
it needs an empty ALT text. And

428
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:47,876
that's a big one because I was
just doing an audit and they had

429
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:53,547
decorative images, but no ALT --
no empty ALT text, which is

430
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:57,326
just the ALT equals, you know,
quotes. And it's -- the quotes

431
00:24:57,326 --> 00:24:58,346
are empty in between.

432
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:01,781
Bekah: Can you explain that? Cuz
that -- I had just recently

433
00:25:01,781 --> 00:25:06,500
learned about that, but still
don't quite understand why

434
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,471
that's the standard.

435
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:11,757
Todd: So there's a -- i-it tells
a screen reader there's an image

436
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:15,700
there, but it doesn't- it
doesn't need -- it's decorative,

437
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,636
basically. So it just --
there's- there's no need to- to

438
00:25:19,636 --> 00:25:20,000
describe --

439
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,500
Dan: So, what ha- what happens
in the screen reader if it runs

440
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,257
into an image with no ALT
attribute at all?

441
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:29,797
Todd: It skips over it. So
you're loo- the- the user is

442
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:32,855
losing information. So if
there's something you're trying

443
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:37,567
to convey, like, let- let's use
the ... like an infographic, for

444
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:42,700
ek- example. And there's no ALT
text on it. That user, that's

445
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,000
using the screen reader, is not
gonna, you know, know that it's

446
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,356
there.

447
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:52,836
Dan: Totally. Totally. And so,
in the case of a decorative

448
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:55,500
image where we don't need to,
like ... it's okay if the screen

449
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,317
-- you know, if -- it's

450
00:25:56,317 --> 00:25:59,227
okay if anybody skips over it.
What do -- you know, what is the

451
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:01,446
tactical difference for a screen
reader -- for a user on a screen

452
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:06,000
reader between an empty -- an-
an image with an em- like with a

453
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,700
ALT property, and just an empty
string, and an image with no

454
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,086
ALT, you know, defined at all?

455
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:24,000
Todd: So, if it's okay, let's
use a logo as an example. If

456
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,287
you have empty

457
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:31,257
ALT text on your logo, but --
and it's also linked, the screen

458
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:39,116
reader will read that link, and
you don't want that to read it,

459
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:45,000
you want it to -- it da- it
doesn't really need to. I mean,

460
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,382
there's

461
00:26:45,382 --> 00:26:51,352
cases where somebody may say,
"Yeah, I want the person to know

462
00:26:51,352 --> 00:26:55,000
what the logo looks like." But
if it's not really necessary,

463
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:04,342
no ALT text, you know, it's --
screen reader won't read

464
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:10,500
anything. And as far as I know
-- and I -- I'll be the first to

465
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,000
say, I'm not an- an- an expert
by any means with screen

466
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,326
readers, because this -- it is a

467
00:27:16,326 --> 00:27:21,500
lot of different stuff. I've
been learning lately, but to

468
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,346
mine -- to

469
00:27:23,346 --> 00:27:30,096
my recollection, anyways, an
empty -- so the -- and -- so, no

470
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:33,300
ALT texts — let me get this
straight [laughs]. No ALT

471
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,311
text, the URL will be read to
the image.

472
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:41,000
Dan: Okay. Yeah. That's the big
difference. All right. That's

473
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,707
the part I didn't know, right?

474
00:27:42,422 --> 00:27:43,321
Todd: Yes. And --

475
00:27:43,356 --> 00:27:46,700
Dan: So there's no ALT ek- text
at all, like, no ALT property

476
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,547
fine -- defined. When a

477
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:50,797
screen reader is reading it,
it'll come through normal texts,

478
00:27:50,826 --> 00:27:52,506
and then it'll just read, like,
blah, blah, blah dot JPEG-

479
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,186
Todd: Yes. Yes.

480
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:55,686
Dan: -right? Okay. That's it.
Nice.

481
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:59,892
Todd: And then the em- the empty
ALT is silent. So that's --

482
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:01,700
Dan: And that means it'll --
that tells it to skip right over

483
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,000
it, which is-

484
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,300
Todd: Yes.

485
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,000
Dan: -what you want sometimes.
Like, sometimes that is the- the

486
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,700
preferred thing.

487
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,000
Todd: Yes.

488
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,300
Dan: Or like the decorative
image where it's, you know, just

489
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,700
a background image or something
like that, or -- probably not

490
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,832
background, but like, you know,
sometimes-

491
00:28:12,832 --> 00:28:13,000
Todd: Yeah.

492
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,872
Dan: -it's just used for
decoration. Doesn't need to

493
00:28:14,872 --> 00:28:16,000
convey actually information.

494
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,300
Todd: Right.

495
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,832
Dan: And so in those cases,
putting an empty ALT, like,

496
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:24,862
ALT equals, you know, empty
string is- is actually very good

497
00:28:24,862 --> 00:28:28,521
and much, like, very good for
accessibility because otherwise

498
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:32,632
they're gonna see, probably a
very long URL with dot JPEG,

499
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:34,311
which means nothing to them,
right?

500
00:28:34,382 --> 00:28:35,491
Todd: Yes. Exactly. Yeah.

501
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:39,000
Dan: Yeah. Oh, that's great.
Yeah. That's one of those things

502
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
that it's like -- and I've seen
a lot of people -- well, this is

503
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,541
a separate topic. I -- but,
like, that- that

504
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:48,711
little, like, pick that little
bit. That just- just -- even

505
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:52,642
just ALT and getting like your
head wrapped around how to deal

506
00:28:52,682 --> 00:28:56,932
with ALT- ALT texts ... like you
said, makes -- can make a huge

507
00:28:56,932 --> 00:28:58,700
difference for accessibility,
making choices [??] for your

508
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,000
users.

509
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Todd: Yeah. Yep.

510
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:01,132
Dan: Ah, that's really cool.

511
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,636
Bekah: And you were talking
about one of the big problems

512
00:29:03,636 --> 00:29:06,500
being color contrast. And-

513
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:06,700
Todd: Mm-hmm.

514
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,727
Bekah: -that seems like
something that could be

515
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:15,636
pretty simple to identify with a
Lighthouse audit. Can you

516
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:18,606
explain what a Lighthouse audit
is? And if you're like, "That's

517
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:21,787
not the way to go, this other
method is better," I would

518
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:22,207
love to hear as well.

519
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:28,700
Todd: So, I mean, I've used
Lighthouse before. I don't

520
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,500
really rely on Lighthouse.

521
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,661
At- at -- it -- Lighthouse runs
off of axe-core and- and which

522
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:42,132
is great. But I don't think it
really gets to the root of every

523
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:49,301
issue. And it really can't --
plus you have false positives,

524
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:52,692
which is, you know, something --
it -- for example, I was just

525
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:55,932
talking about this on the -- in
the- in the Slack — Virtual

526
00:29:55,932 --> 00:30:01,466
Coffee Slack. False positives
for color contrast, you know?

527
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,737
I've come across instances where
it will flag color contrast

528
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:08,007
errors,

529
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:13,676
but the color contrast is far
exceeds the 4.5 to 1 ratio. So

530
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:16,767
I don't really rely on
Lighthouse. I mean, it's a good

531
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:20,000
tool, don't get me wrong.
Because there's that performance

532
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,635
piece to

533
00:30:20,636 --> 00:30:30,750
it that I really, really like
using. And as far as, you know

534
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:37,000
... it- it's a good tool, don't
get me wrong. But I- I use --

535
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,851
and I used

536
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:40,432
to use it. I used to use it
myself. I mean, I used it on my

537
00:30:40,432 --> 00:30:42,801
site and was like, "Yeah, 100. I
got 100 across

538
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:46,342
the board." And, you know, that-
that virtual confetti

539
00:30:46,342 --> 00:30:53,471
flying everywhere. But the tools
that I use would be the --

540
00:30:56,067 --> 00:31:03,700
it's a contrast-ratio.com, which
is Lea Verou color contrast

541
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:10,076
site. I also use the -- let me
look, I have it on my

542
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:15,596
other machine here, the color
contrast analyzer. And that is

543
00:31:15,747 --> 00:31:21,700
by The Paciello Group. So Steven
Faulkner has a what -- based on

544
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,105
the Windows

545
00:31:22,106 --> 00:31:26,156
version. The Mac iOS version was
developed by somebody else.

546
00:31:26,156 --> 00:31:33,926
I use that- that tool as well.
And I will provide the link

547
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:34,497
to that. So that --

548
00:31:35,414 --> 00:31:37,419
Bekah: This great. I'm, like,
really looking forward to- to

549
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:40,598
diving into a lot of these
resources that you are dropping

550
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:45,488
right now. Cuz I think sometimes
I -- it's hard to know where

551
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:46,500
to start. And-

552
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:46,700
Todd: Mm-hmm.

553
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:51,429
Bekah: -and I think that's just
a problem with teaching

554
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:54,413
developers in general. There's
not a focus on it. It's not

555
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,397
built

556
00:31:57,429 --> 00:32:07,118
into most curriculums and -- at
all. And so there's a lack of

557
00:32:07,118 --> 00:32:11,773
focus, I think, as a result of
that. And then not knowing where

558
00:32:11,773 --> 00:32:16,114
to start, or if you're with a
company that doesn't look at

559
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:18,668
those things, then I think it
can be -- you can find yourself

560
00:32:18,668 --> 00:32:21,222
a while

561
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:27,223
down the path and- and not know
what you should be identifying,

562
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:30,374
how you should be approaching
this. And so, the more that we

563
00:32:30,374 --> 00:32:35,084
talk about it, I think the
better. Where do you think

564
00:32:35,534 --> 00:32:39,044
people could get started if they
want to learn more about

565
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:39,403
accessibility?

566
00:32:40,094 --> 00:32:48,662
Todd: So the W3C has a great
intro to accessibility

567
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:52,982
class, which I believe is still
free. And yeah, it's an

568
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:55,947
Introduction to Web
Accessibility on edx.org. And

569
00:32:55,947 --> 00:32:58,852
I took that

570
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:04,047
class even. And it was -- it's
great. You can pace yourself,

571
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:07,092
doesn't have to be real fast.
There's no, you know, there's no

572
00:33:07,092 --> 00:33:09,656
s- due date

573
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:11,907
or anything. There's a free
version. If you want a

574
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:17,877
certificate, you got to pay a
certain amount. It's like -- if

575
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:21,238
you put in four to five hours a
week, it's like four- four weeks

576
00:33:21,238 --> 00:33:27,000
long to do. It gives a good
overview of, [clearing throat]

577
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,373
excuse me,

578
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:31,700
accessibility, and, you know,
some- some of the guidelines,

579
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,363
there's ... a

580
00:33:34,363 --> 00:33:40,542
lot of good information on the
web, and I even have to

581
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:44,532
pitch Nobility's website and
their blog. They go over some of

582
00:33:44,532 --> 00:33:50,337
the WCAG guidelines. And- and
accessibility is also — I wanna

583
00:33:50,337 --> 00:33:52,707
make this clear — accessibility
is more than just WCAG

584
00:33:52,707 --> 00:33:55,077
guidelines.

585
00:33:55,438 --> 00:34:01,647
It's also about inclusive design
as well. Making sure,

586
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:07,048
you know, certain demographics
aren't, you know, kept out that

587
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:12,117
they -- everybody's included,
hence the name inclusive design.

588
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:21,768
But, some other ... let's see.
That's a good

589
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,797
question. Cuz there's so much --
I mean, I guess, you know, a

590
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:31,728
search would come up with a lot
of different things. Webaim.org

591
00:34:31,797 --> 00:34:36,027
has some good stuff as far as
accessibility -- learning

592
00:34:36,027 --> 00:34:43,018
accessibility. Level Access
does. Let's see. Who else?

593
00:34:44,327 --> 00:34:47,310
TPGI has good stuff. So there's-
there's a lot out there that,

594
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:50,293
you

595
00:34:50,293 --> 00:34:54,913
know, people can find on, you
know? Ev- even -- there's even

596
00:34:54,913 --> 00:35:00,300
like courses on, I guess, u-
Udemy and platforms like that

597
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:00,943
as well.

598
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:06,613
Bekah: So ki- this is kind of
been your focus the entire time

599
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:09,373
you've

600
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:15,373
been working in tech. Was there
a reason that you went down this

601
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:20,381
path or- or something that kind
of inspired this journey? Or

602
00:35:20,382 --> 00:35:22,463
have you just always been
interested in it?

603
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:30,722
Todd: It started when a couple
of family members -- I have

604
00:35:30,722 --> 00:35:35,000
like three family members, you
know, that have disabilities.

605
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,603
Two have

606
00:35:36,603 --> 00:35:45,012
motor skill disabilities, one
visual. And seeing the looks of

607
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:48,342
frustration on their faces when
they're trying to access

608
00:35:48,342 --> 00:35:52,842
something that's inaccessible on
the web really got me motivated

609
00:35:52,842 --> 00:36:01,362
in the beginning and carries me
to this day, really. I kind

610
00:36:01,362 --> 00:36:08,700
of -- towards like 2018, 2019
was kind of, like, I guess

611
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,631
slacking off a little bit with
my accessibility, but I- I get

612
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:14,346
together

613
00:36:14,347 --> 00:36:19,300
with our friend, Chris DeMars,
in Burlington, Vermont. He --

614
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,047
there was a-

615
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:27,811
there was a conference and, you
know, he gave a great talk and

616
00:36:27,992 --> 00:36:32,972
that really lit the fire again.
So there's been a really -- it's

617
00:36:32,972 --> 00:36:38,911
been like laser, like focus for
me, as far as -- since then. And

618
00:36:38,942 --> 00:36:44,500
just the- the- the looks of
frustration on faces of people

619
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,000
that I've seen,

620
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,831
trying to ac- access something
that's inaccessible on the web.

621
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:58,416
It's just, it's very ... the
word I'm looking for here,

622
00:36:58,956 --> 00:37:04,086
very -- it hits home. It- it
really, you know, being that I

623
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:12,186
try to advocate for people that
don't have a voice. And I

624
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:17,452
think, as- as accessibility
professionals, we all do. We try

625
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:22,000
to advocate for those people.
Especially lately with

626
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
certain — I will use it in
quotes — accessibility

627
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
overlays, for instance,

628
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,331
but [chuckles], yeah. That's
basically where it all started

629
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:39,700
was just those family members
and friends, and- and just

630
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,000
seeing people, you know?

631
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,711
the- the frustration and the
point where they're ready to

632
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:46,282
give up.

633
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:53,067
Bekah: Yeah. I- I was just with
Chris last week. He spoke at

634
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:57,700
KCDC, he -- along with Cass
Ferris. And they did an

635
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,117
accessibility

636
00:37:58,137 --> 00:38:00,500
talk. That was the first time I-
I got to see him speak in

637
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,000
person. It was really great
because they both come at it

638
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,052
with a lot of

639
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:09,580
passion and examples. And I
think for so many of us, we have

640
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:13,001
a general sense of what
accessibility is, but we don't

641
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:18,876
have that broader sense of, you
know, it- it might be -- there

642
00:38:18,876 --> 00:38:23,257
might be a disability that you
can't see or it might be a

643
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:27,007
temporary disability or a mental
health challenge that somebody

644
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:27,700
is going through. And-

645
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,000
Todd: Mm-hmm.

646
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,126
Bekah: -all of those things can
impact what

647
00:38:30,126 --> 00:38:34,177
accessibility looks like. And if
you really look at the people

648
00:38:34,177 --> 00:38:39,681
around you, you for sure know
someone that has one of those

649
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:43,492
challenges or- or you have one
yourself. And so, you know,

650
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,192
opening up the conversations
about this, you know, like you

651
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:50,751
have, in- in like Chris and Cass
have, I think is so important to

652
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,902
really making change in- in tech
overall.

653
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:59,000
Todd: Yeah, I -- you know, you-
you brought up invisible di-

654
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,766
you know ...

655
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:06,297
disabilities. I have migraine
headaches. I get them when

656
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:11,306
something sets off. If there's a
website I visit that has, you

657
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:17,306
know, animation or motion that
really, it's too much. And it's

658
00:39:17,336 --> 00:39:20,757
triggers a migraine. I mean,
there's all that stuff that you

659
00:39:20,757 --> 00:39:26,541
mentioned and i-it's ... you
know? Chris is great, you

660
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:31,000
know? I- I, yeah. I've, you
know, seen him talk, you know,

661
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,231
virtually, and

662
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:37,132
then before the pandemic, and
everything. And we've gotten to

663
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:39,306
know each other. And he, you
know, he- he does a great job

664
00:39:39,306 --> 00:39:41,480
advocating.

665
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,000
Bekah: Yeah. I think, you know,
even -- so, a couple of years

666
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,369
ago I was

667
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:48,090
diagnosed with ADHD. And it's
interesting how much I didn't

668
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,370
realize that impacts the things
that I interact with and the

669
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,650
ways

670
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,500
that I interact with things. And
I- [chuckles] I feel like maybe

671
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,965
this is just a personal problem.

672
00:39:56,965 --> 00:39:59,905
But this is the conversation
between Discord and Slack for

673
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:04,135
me, like, I walk into Discord --
I don't walk in there. I open up

674
00:40:04,494 --> 00:40:08,500
Discord, and it's immediately
just overwhelming, and-

675
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:08,700
Todd: Mm-hmm.

676
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:11,514
Bekah: -I don't know where to go
from there. And then I just like

677
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:15,000
slowly back out the door, right?
Like, there's too-

678
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,300
Todd: Yeah.

679
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,135
Bekah: -much going on for me.

680
00:40:16,356 --> 00:40:19,000
Todd: Yeah. That- that
information overload happens to

681
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,657
me as well [chuckles]. It's-

682
00:40:19,657 --> 00:40:28,811
it's like Slack, and Discord,
and there's -- yeah, I was

683
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:35,000
on -- I was watching a Twitch
stream yesterday and the- the

684
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,500
chat was going off, and I was
just, like, I just -- I can't --

685
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,000
I wan- I wanna be able to lur-
kind of read the chat, and I

686
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,112
can't, because, you know, it- it
-- yeah. The-

687
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:46,481
the information overload is a
big thing too. Yeah.

688
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:52,929
Bekah: So I, you know, I think,
your background, you talked

689
00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:57,400
about your journey through this.
And it seems like you've been

690
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:59,679
mostly self-taught then. Is that
right?

691
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:03,248
Todd: Yeah. I started when I
picked up that Commodore 64

692
00:41:03,248 --> 00:41:05,910
user

693
00:41:05,911 --> 00:41:11,500
manual. And just, I- I love, you
know, to read, and I read that.

694
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,771
I had purchased a

695
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:17,821
book. It was a "Learn HTML in 21
Days". And it was like a big,

696
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:21,871
huge,

697
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:26,851
thick phone-book-like manual.
And I read through that. That's

698
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:33,242
how I actually to -- made my
first website. Not that I put it

699
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:39,632
out on the web or anything, but
then I- I graduated from

700
00:41:39,632 --> 00:41:43,890
there on -- I went to GeoCities,
and Angelfire, and Tripod, and

701
00:41:43,891 --> 00:41:46,922
all those websites [chuckles],
if you remember those websites.

702
00:41:46,942 --> 00:41:47,612
Dan: Hm. Hell, yeah.

703
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:52,411
Todd: And all the great, you
know, lime green, and pastel,

704
00:41:52,742 --> 00:41:56,559
and, you know, fluorescent
colors. And then, you know, it's

705
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,376
been a

706
00:42:00,376 --> 00:42:04,847
learning process the entire time
and I love to learn. So it's one

707
00:42:04,847 --> 00:42:07,456
of those things where if I can
pick up something in a Slack

708
00:42:07,876 --> 00:42:13,427
group or on a Discord channel.
That's great. I've, you know, I

709
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:19,947
keep learning every day and, you
know, learning ... lately it's

710
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:23,500
been learning the intricacies of
the WCAG guidelines because

711
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,756
there's so much there, and being
able to — and I'm grateful for

712
00:42:26,756 --> 00:42:29,576
this —

713
00:42:29,606 --> 00:42:36,177
being able to work on the next,
I guess, version, which is 3.0,

714
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:41,097
which is a few years down the
road has been a learning process

715
00:42:41,097 --> 00:42:43,091
as well. And being a member of
the W3C is too. And being in

716
00:42:43,091 --> 00:42:49,500
those meetings, and we're
learning so much from a great

717
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,322
group of people.

718
00:42:50,942 --> 00:42:52,547
Bekah: Yeah, that's awesome. I-
I love that idea of just

719
00:42:52,547 --> 00:42:54,152
consistent

720
00:42:54,152 --> 00:42:55,636
learning and being open to
learning, all of the time.

721
00:42:55,636 --> 00:43:01,300
Because I think, no matter what
part of tech or- or any

722
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,300
industry, really, that

723
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,612
you're in, the being open to
learning new things, and talking

724
00:43:05,612 --> 00:43:07,697
through things with other
people, and understanding is,

725
00:43:07,697 --> 00:43:09,782
you know,

726
00:43:09,782 --> 00:43:14,251
that- that's what growing is
about. That's what is important

727
00:43:14,251 --> 00:43:14,882
to what you're doing.

728
00:43:18,112 --> 00:43:23,001
Todd: Yeah. And it's, you know,
even I've, you know, learned --

729
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:26,500
I learned on Twitter as well,
you know? I see something, a

730
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:26,722
link to

731
00:43:26,722 --> 00:43:30,262
an article or something, and I
check it out, and it's like,

732
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:34,700
"Oh, well," you know, "It --
today I learned [laughs]," you

733
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,500
know? And-

734
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:36,700
Bekah: Yeah.

735
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,981
Todd: -you know, I -- it's-

736
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:42,500
it's, you know, there was a
quote, and I'll try to find that

737
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:49,532
quote because I love the quote.
It had something to do with

738
00:43:49,652 --> 00:43:57,601
doing something ... yeah, right
there. "There are three

739
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:03,976
things everyone should do every
day. Number one is laugh. Number

740
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:08,700
two is think — spend some time
in thought. Number three, you

741
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,000
should have your emotions move
you to tears. If you laugh,

742
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,035
think and cry,

743
00:44:13,036 --> 00:44:15,256
that's a heck of a day." And
that was just like the best

744
00:44:15,256 --> 00:44:17,476
quote I

745
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:21,916
think I've seen in- in a long,
long time. I even add to that

746
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:23,137
learning one thing a day.

747
00:44:23,873 --> 00:44:24,700
Bekah: Yeah. I love that so
much.

748
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,000
Dan: Yeah.

749
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,838
Bekah: I didn't think, you know,

750
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:32,000
learning things on Twitter for
me has been really big as well.

751
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,700
Even when somebody just has a
small portion of a tweet at --

752
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,000
for some reason, it sticks in my
mind better than if I read a

753
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,700
whole article on that thing.

754
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,000
Todd: Yeah.

755
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,700
Bekah: And I think, maybe,
because there's some type of

756
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,138
personal connection there, like,
"Oh, I remember that person said

757
00:44:46,139 --> 00:44:48,929
this one thing." And it, you
know, it might be some type of

758
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,100
coding tip or whatever, but I
think that just be -- just

759
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:53,338
sharing

760
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:57,568
that knowledge or- or it's,
"Hey, I know that I could ask

761
00:44:57,568 --> 00:45:02,849
that person that question," can
be really helpful in finding the

762
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:07,768
answers to things or having more
confidence in- in being- being

763
00:45:07,798 --> 00:45:09,298
able to ask questions.

764
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:15,000
Todd: Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's- it's,
you know, I use Twitter as a

765
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
tool to say, you know,

766
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,358
"Oh, you- you mentioned
something about the new, you

767
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:28,000
know, whatever coming- coming
down the line. I've got a

768
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,418
couple

769
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:33,349
of questions for you," you know?
"Hey, can I," you know, "DM

770
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:36,998
you? I got a question I need to
ask." And it- it reaching out to

771
00:45:36,998 --> 00:45:40,869
somebody to -- or to the person
that, you know, had that tweet

772
00:45:41,259 --> 00:45:46,700
it -- is -- and- and mo- you
know, I don't think I've ever

773
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,743
had anybody go, "No, I don't
wanna tell you the answer," or

774
00:45:48,743 --> 00:45:50,258
anything like that.

775
00:45:50,438 --> 00:45:55,418
So, yeah, it's- it's always
been, you know, "Hey," you

776
00:45:55,418 --> 00:46:00,074
know, "I've got this question."
People are more than, you know,

777
00:46:00,943 --> 00:46:04,304
more than welcome to- to, you
know, answer those questions.

778
00:46:05,634 --> 00:46:07,943
Bekah: Yeah. And I think that's
so big. Especially when we're

779
00:46:07,943 --> 00:46:11,244
talking about this topic. If you
don't know it is okay to ask

780
00:46:11,244 --> 00:46:11,700
somebody-

781
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,000
Todd: Mm-hmm.

782
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,700
Bekah: -right? Or ask someone
just to direct you, you know?

783
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,700
"I'm getting started in this.
It's not been a focus. How- how

784
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,700
do I get started? What do I do?"

785
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,000
Todd: Mm-hmm.

786
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,763
Bekah: And you dropped a lot of
great resources here. But, you

787
00:46:22,764 --> 00:46:26,333
know, I think in- in every place
and space, we should- we should

788
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:28,700
know that it is okay to ask
about these things. And it's

789
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,813
good to do that.

790
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:34,000
Todd: Yeah, definitely. You
know, the -- I- I tell people,

791
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,357
you know, if you

792
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:35,738
have a question about
accessibility, I'll do my best

793
00:46:35,738 --> 00:46:37,118
to

794
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,300
answer. If I can't answer it, I
will find somebody that can, or

795
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,300
I will look it up and see if I
can get you the answer. Because

796
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:43,518
it's-

797
00:46:43,518 --> 00:46:46,300
it's- it's that little, you
know, it's that being helpful-

798
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:46,500
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

799
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,364
Todd: -in make -- you know,
making sure that person has that

800
00:46:50,364 --> 00:46:54,594
information, for me anyways, is-
is- is big. And, you know, just

801
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:57,684
saying, you know, feeling good
about being able to help people.

802
00:46:59,293 --> 00:47:01,364
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. That's so
important.

803
00:47:01,364 --> 00:47:02,224
Dan: I love that.

804
00:47:03,773 --> 00:47:05,700
Bekah: Todd, we have about one
-- a time for one more question.

805
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,817
And then -- and

806
00:47:06,818 --> 00:47:07,958
I'd love to hear what you have
to say about this. Cuz I know

807
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,098
that

808
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:12,699
there still are companies out
there that are -- have some

809
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:18,398
pushback about paying for making
things accessible, or they say

810
00:47:18,398 --> 00:47:20,588
like, "Well, that's not our
focus right now because we don't

811
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,628
have the time or the money to do
that." How would you approach

812
00:47:22,628 --> 00:47:24,668
that situation? Or,

813
00:47:24,818 --> 00:47:27,500
you know, maybe if you were a- a
developer consulting on that,

814
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,398
you know, how would you kind of
convince them that this- this

815
00:47:30,398 --> 00:47:31,179
should be a priority?

816
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:36,463
Todd: Funny you mentioned that,
cuz I wrote a article

817
00:47:36,824 --> 00:47:43,700
about that, and it's on Smashing
Magazine. So I'll get that to --

818
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,981
link to you as well. It's- it's
a very tricky slope sometimes.

819
00:47:51,858 --> 00:47:55,608
You know, I've heard people, for
instance, say, "Well, you don't

820
00:47:55,608 --> 00:48:00,534
wanna get sued." And that kind
of perks up stakeholders ears

821
00:48:00,534 --> 00:48:03,353
and says, "Oh," you know, "Well,
I guess we're gonna have to do

822
00:48:03,353 --> 00:48:14,500
this." Me, I use real world
examples of ... for instance, I

823
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:20,700
ran into a stakeholder on a
project. And I said, "We gotta

824
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,500
make sure accessibility is done
from the very beginning of

825
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,500
the project." He turned to me
and said, "We don't have

826
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:32,500
disabled users." I, in turn,
said to him, "You're wearing

827
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,233
eyeglasses. That's

828
00:48:33,233 --> 00:48:38,454
an assistive technology." And he
kind of perked up. But I'd

829
00:48:38,454 --> 00:48:42,700
hadn't convinced him [laughs].
So the, you know, there- there's

830
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,402
some people that

831
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:47,934
can be very stubborn. So I went
as far as to say, you know,

832
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:50,754
somebody working, you know,
using your product, they can

833
00:48:50,754 --> 00:48:52,974
have

834
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:55,554
a broken arm, it could be a
situational disability. They

835
00:48:55,563 --> 00:48:58,224
could have a broken arm. They
could be at home working with a

836
00:48:58,224 --> 00:49:02,094
child on their lap. That's very
fussy. I've been there a long

837
00:49:02,094 --> 00:49:08,000
time ago. I know that feeling
and I, you know ... I know,

838
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,712
Bekah, you're

839
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:10,753
a parent. I don't know if you're
a parent, Dan, but, you know --

840
00:49:10,853 --> 00:49:11,253
Dan: Oh, yeah.

841
00:49:11,753 --> 00:49:15,264
Todd: Yeah. Yeah. So, you both
know that, you know, you have a

842
00:49:15,264 --> 00:49:17,700
child on your lap and they're
fussy [laughs], and then, you

843
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,563
know, and you're

844
00:49:18,563 --> 00:49:22,164
trying to answer an email or
something. It's very difficult.

845
00:49:22,164 --> 00:49:26,408
So, you know, getting teams on
board is another thing too.

846
00:49:26,408 --> 00:49:30,652
Where

847
00:49:30,684 --> 00:49:35,918
getting somebody, a person
dedicated to doing accessibility

848
00:49:35,918 --> 00:49:39,338
on the design side, on the
development side, on the

849
00:49:39,338 --> 00:49:45,009
marketing side, that helps too.
But the main thing is getting

850
00:49:45,009 --> 00:49:49,000
stakeholders on board. If you
can get a stakeholder on board,

851
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
then it should be ve- much, much
easier to get the entire

852
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,498
organization on board.

853
00:49:57,268 --> 00:49:58,433
Bekah: Yeah, that's great. I
love that. You know, it all

854
00:49:58,433 --> 00:49:59,598
comes down

855
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,228
to listening and being
open-minded, right? If we work

856
00:50:03,228 --> 00:50:06,700
towards understanding each
other, then we can all do a

857
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,139
whole lot more to improve things
for everyone.

858
00:50:10,478 --> 00:50:14,700
Todd: Yeah, definitely.
Definitely. Yep. And- and I've

859
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,500
heard it- I've- Ive heard it

860
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,268
before, "We don't have the
budget," you know? "We'll

861
00:50:19,268 --> 00:50:26,418
get to it after launch." Well,
that brings me back to ... yep.

862
00:50:26,418 --> 00:50:28,998
If you do everything from the
beginning, you will have the

863
00:50:28,998 --> 00:50:33,000
money for it, and, you know,
it'll be less stressed. So,

864
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,108
yeah.

865
00:50:33,148 --> 00:50:35,188
Dan: And you don't need to pay
for it or find the budget to pay

866
00:50:35,188 --> 00:50:38,200
for a whole round of- of, you
know, auditing and stuff like

867
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:38,454
that [chuckles].

868
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:45,298
Todd: Right. Yeah. And auditing,
so, I'll use an example of a

869
00:50:45,298 --> 00:50:53,664
company that got sued and what
they could have- what they could

870
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:55,643
have spent just with, you know,
doing it from the beginning.

871
00:50:55,643 --> 00:50:57,622
They

872
00:50:57,623 --> 00:51:00,713
ended up paying seven figures
for an audit. So, that should

873
00:51:00,713 --> 00:51:05,634
tell you something [chuckles]
about that process.

874
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:07,149
Bekah: Right. And it shouldn't
ever have to come to that.

875
00:51:07,149 --> 00:51:08,500
That's just-

876
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:08,700
Todd: No.

877
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,494
Bekah: -you know, absolutely
ridiculous.

878
00:51:11,494 --> 00:51:11,793
Todd: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

879
00:51:12,728 --> 00:51:14,768
Bekah: But I'm so glad that
you're here today to talk us

880
00:51:14,768 --> 00:51:17,228
through this and drop all of
these great resources. And I

881
00:51:17,228 --> 00:51:20,700
really hope that, you know, it
helps people who are listening

882
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,878
to work through the stuff. And
to know that it's okay to ask

883
00:51:24,878 --> 00:51:30,233
questions, and to grow, and
learn more all the time. So

884
00:51:30,233 --> 00:51:33,563
we'll make sure that we drop all
those links in the show notes.

885
00:51:33,713 --> 00:51:35,634
And thanks so much for being
here with us today, Todd.

886
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,000
Dan: Yeah, thanks, Todd.

887
00:51:36,474 --> 00:51:37,134
Todd: Well, thank you.

888
00:51:37,173 --> 00:51:38,074
Dan: I really appreciate it too.

889
00:51:38,483 --> 00:51:39,804
Todd: Yeah. Thank you both for
having me.

890
00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:41,483
Bekah: Bye.

891
00:51:41,824 --> 00:51:44,023
Dan: Alright. Bye, Todd.

892
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:44,873
