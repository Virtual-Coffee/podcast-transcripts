Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and welcome to
season 5, episode 9 of the

00:00:09,746 --> 00:00:15,054
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

00:00:15,054 --> 00:00:19,013
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

00:00:19,013 --> 00:00:21,653
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:24,414
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:24,414 --> 00:00:27,443
stories and what they've learned.
And we're here to share it with

7
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:31,583

00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,084
favorite maintainer, Kirk.

9
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:39,476
Dan: Hello! Welcome to our season
finale of season 5. As we

10
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:43,707
traditionally do, we have Kirk on
to hang out with us because we

11
00:00:43,707 --> 00:00:47,877
all love Kirk very much. And
we are going to talk about some

12
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:53,286
choices we made with- with
Virtual Coffee and some feedback

13
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:57,606
we've had over the last few
months, and what we have

14
00:00:57,606 --> 00:01:03,067
going on in the future. So, glad
as always to have Kirk here. And,

15
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:04,626
yeah, it's gonna be fun.

16
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:07,861
Bekah: Yeah. And we're gonna
start off this episode of the

17
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:12,001
podcast like we start off every
Virtual Coffee. We'll introduce

18
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:15,811
ourselves with our name, where
we're from, what we do, and a

19
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:27,832
random check-in question. We hope
you enjoy this episode. Our

20
00:01:27,832 --> 00:01:33,263
question today is what was your
favorite game to play as a child?

21
00:01:34,843 --> 00:01:39,882
My name is Bekah. I'm a technical
community builder from a small

22
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:44,612
town in Ohio, and my favorite
game to play as a child -- I mean,

23
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:49,183
like, due go up to here [??], I
really loved Othello, so I played

24
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:53,263
a lot of Othello with my dad.
And then I'm gonna go outdoor

25
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:57,612
games. We also played a lot of
kickball and badminton in my

26
00:01:57,612 --> 00:01:59,923
backyard. So I can't really
decide between kickball and

27
00:01:59,923 --> 00:02:04,332
badminton, but I have very fond
memories of all of those things.

28
00:02:04,628 --> 00:02:06,158
Dan: All right, so you're going
three games.

29
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:08,143
Bekah: Yeah. Okay. [Crosstalk 00:02:07,000]
I can do what I want, right? [Laughs]

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,858
Dan: What are your three favorite
games? [Laughs]

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Kirk Shillingford: Pick your favorite
game. [Unintelligible]

31
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:12,973
Bekah: You get one, Dan.

32
00:02:14,228 --> 00:02:22,318
Dan: [Laughs] Hi, I'm Dan. You all know
who I am. My favorite game -- I don't

33
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:23,518
know. This is like when my mind just
to the next --

34
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:26,383
Bekah: Wait- wait a minute. You said,
"We- you all know who I am." [Dan laughs] What if you have a

35
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:28,092
first time listener here, okay?

36
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:32,518
Dan: Okay. Well, first time listener. Well, I'm
Dan. I live in Cleveland. I make

37
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:37,258
websites stuff with code.
Sometimes in frontend -- most of the time,

38
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:40,858
frontend, sometimes backend.
I do a lot of other things too.

39
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:47,907
And it's all on my computer [Dan & Bekah laugh].
I'm sorry. I'm having trouble

40
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:48,897
today. All right.

41
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:53,668
Bekah: You should participated in the monthly challenge last 
month for the elevator pitch. I

42
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:54,598
think it would have helped you-

43
00:02:54,828 --> 00:02:55,457
Kirk: No, that's the perfect [unintelligible]-

44
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:56,548
Bekah: -refine your intro.

45
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:57,807
Dan: I should have.

46
00:02:57,828 --> 00:02:58,518
Kirk: -angel word.

47
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:08,728
Dan: I- I make computer
things [chuckles].

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Kirk: Real quick.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:15,747
Dan: So, games as a child ... we had this- we had this
board game called "Omega Virus"-

Bekah: Yes! Yes, "Omega Virus".

49
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:17,427
Dan: -is the first thing that popped in
mind. You know "Omega Virus"?

50
00:03:17,627 --> 00:03:17,627
Bekah: Yes! 

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Dan: [Chuckles] Oh my god. That's amazing.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,187
Bekah: I think I
accidentally called Omicron "Omega virus" [laughs] one time in public. And
somebody was like, "What?" [laughs].

52
00:03:25,587 --> 00:03:28,348
Dan: [Laughs] It's amazing! Okay. So
that game was really fun. I- I

53
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:30,328
mean, I don't even know if it's a
good game, but it had -- you know,

54
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:33,927
a guy that yelled at you, and
robots and stuff. And so it was-

55
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:35,907
it was fun. That was the first
thing that popped in my mind. So

56
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:39,687
we played lots of games
growing up. But that one has

57
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:44,502
a special place -- you know, in my heart. So ... for
my one favorite game I'm picking

58
00:03:44,502 --> 00:03:45,173
"Omega Virus."

59
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:46,000
Bekah: I was the one -- I wanna
add another one.

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Dan: Cuz I thought the rules --

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,893
Bekah: Number four. Computer game, loved Monkey
Island, and it's coming back. And

61
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:56,325
I'm so excited about that. So, now
I'm done. Go ahead, Kirk [chuckles].

62
00:03:57,211 --> 00:04:02,846
Kirk: By so many thoughts, the
thought of a trailer for a Monkey

63
00:04:02,846 --> 00:04:05,966
Island, it's so strange. It looks
like the strangest game in the

64
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:09,355
world. And then I said, "Of
course, Bekah likes this." You know, craps.

65
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:17,906
Games that I liked as a child
is "You're-not-leaving-this-table-

66
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:21,985
until-you-eat-these-vegetables-
jokes-on-you." I have a book. A

67
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:26,755
game. Because me and my mom
played that a lot. And I won a

68
00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:30,980
lot, like, "I guess you can't get to finish
your food," and I'm like, "I'm just

69
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:37,190
gonna read until we get bored, and I'm gonna go [chuckles]".
Okay.

70
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,100
Bekah: [Chuckles] It's not a real game.

71
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,281
Kirk: It's a real game and I'm
the champion. Board games

72
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:48,230
"Risk" is -- I know a lot of people
hate "Risk". I love "Risk." I'm super

73
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:54,711
into roll those dice, fighting
those armies, you know? I

74
00:04:54,711 --> 00:05:00,216
love -- I got beaten up at "Risk" by, like,
an 86 year old woman. And I sort

75
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:04,565
of like dedicated six months of
my life [chuckles] to revenge on the board

76
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:12,485
game, not -- you know. So, Risk
is pretty big ... computer

77
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:18,591
games? There's this really -- this
is computer game called "DX Ball". And

78
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:21,860
it's basically just like
glorified, like, "Pong". It was like

79
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,810
super "Pong". And if I get 200
levels, there were explosions and

80
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,971
it was like a real -- there's a lot going
on there. I really liked that.

81
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:38,271
That was really fun. And I also
remember at the age of seven, my mom

82
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,750
got me like a "Reader Rabbit."
Learn math on the computer CD

83
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,990
cuz that seemed like a great
idea. And it immediately crashed

84
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,040
our computer and it like never turned
back on. So, I don't know what the

85
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,230
life lesson there is. Don't [unintelligible]-

86
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,850
Bekah: There's a lot of "Reader Rabbit."

87
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,687
Kirk: -your children arithmetic.
Those are my answers.

88
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,937
Dan: I -- all right. I'm gonna add --
I'm having an addict- an addition. I thought about --

89
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,158
I remembered "Wolfenstein" on a
computer game.

90
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:03,913
Bekah: Yeah -- no. You're not allowed.

91
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:04,673
Dan: Yeah. "Wolfenstein" is awesome.

92
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:06,372
Bekah: Sorry. Take it back.
You're done.

93
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:07,867
Dan: So I played that lot.

94
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:09,627
Kirk: Now that I think, you fire this? [??]

95
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:13,173
Bekah: Yeah. Well, Dan's in
trouble, so he doesn't get all of

96
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:13,000
the things [laughs].

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Dan: In trouble [chuckles].

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Bekah: He's being punished.

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000 
Dan: For what?

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Bekah: I won [chuckles].

97
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,259
Dan: I don't even know what I did.

98
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,829
Kirk: Well, I don't really swift the -- you know, no old game of Othello or
something.

99
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:30,040
Dan: Othello was pretty cool
too. I liked the artists. I don't

100
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,579
know if they all do, but ours had
like a felt boarders, you know?

00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:33,579
Bekah: Yeah.

101
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:40,375
Dan: Okay. Yeah. That's cool. I don't know. I appreciate that it had -- thought I had a- I had a
really nice tactical feel to it

102
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,944
that the pieces in the- in the
felt and stuff.

103
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:46,254
Bekah: Yeah. I started playing it
with my 12-year-old, but then,

104
00:06:46,254 --> 00:06:48,654
like, one of the other kids got
ahold of it. And so now we don't

105
00:06:48,654 --> 00:06:53,334
have all of the chips. So from --
Backgammon. I like Backgammon

106
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:54,745
too. I like games.

107
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:56,394
Dan: I never learned how to play
Backgammon.

108
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:59,500
Kirk: I had one of those chess
boards. It was like chess on top

109
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,370
and then back-end low. So below
was just like -- it was like in the

110
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,879
Lion King. Like, just don't go
there cuz it's bad.

111
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:11,415
Dan: [Laughs] Yeah, same. I played the -- I played chess
a lot and never played Backgammon

112
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:13,134
and never -- I dunno. I --

113
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:14,935
Bekah: We have very cool
Backgammon suit -- it was like a

114
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,875
suitcase. It looked like a small
suitcase and then we were like pop

115
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,225
open. It was very nice.

116
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:25,396
Kirk: I played to defeat my father. Like, I
only -- I found the game. I pressed

117
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:31,007
him every day for months and he
would beat me every day. And so

118
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:35,656
the day I beat him, and then ... it
was like the happiest day of my

119
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:39,682
life [chuckles]. And then we kept playing
until it was pretty even who

120
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:43,401
would win. And then he was like,
"I'm not playing anymore [laughs]." The

121
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:50,512
whole point of being here, "Is it I beat you at being [unintelligible]
all the way around?" And that's

122
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:55,161
pretty much the last time I
played chess. I did what I set out to accomplish.

124
00:07:56,721 --> 00:08:01,461
Bekah: Okay. But, we are not here
to talk about games the entire

125
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:06,607
time, although that might be a
fun episode [chuckles]. So, we put it out

126
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:09,336
there to the Virtual Coffee
community, what they wanted to

127
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:13,716
hear about. And I think they
wanted to hear about what we had

128
00:08:13,716 --> 00:08:17,497
as our back pocket topic anyway.
So, today we're going to be

129
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,826
talking about our decision to
pause membership with Virtual

130
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:25,596
Coffee, the things that we've
been doing and what we see for

131
00:08:25,596 --> 00:08:28,927
the future. So, Kirk, do you wanna
give a little bit of a recap

132
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:30,427
of where we're at?

133
00:08:31,622 --> 00:08:36,062
Kirk: Yeah. I think how it
can be sort of like summing up

134
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:41,851
of the- the concise way.
Membership -- incoming members has

135
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:46,892
been paused with the Virtual
Coffee community for a couple of

136
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:54,062
months now. This -- the decision
was not made lightly. We spent a

137
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:56,312
lot of time thinking about it and
trying to figure out if there was

138
00:08:56,312 --> 00:09:00,601
like another way to not have to
do that, to sort of like get the

139
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:06,662
desired outcomes. But I think we
just realized the only way we

140
00:09:06,662 --> 00:09:12,591
were gonna sort of keep things
okay for our volunteers. And also

141
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:16,971
just like give us the bandwidth
to make things better for

142
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:21,562
incoming members was to take a
pause, right? And it's- it's like one

143
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:25,072
of those real ... you know,
sometimes like you just have to

144
00:09:25,162 --> 00:09:27,831
make priorities when you do not
have internet resources. And that

145
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:31,552
was a decision we made and I
think it was the right one. I

146
00:09:31,552 --> 00:09:36,471
think -- we think it was the right one.
As it's given us a lot of space to

147
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:40,476
really go with like, "Hey, when we
open back up, what do we wanna

148
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:43,356
do? What do we want this to be?"
Think back to what our

149
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:46,596
mission is. Think back to like
what's working well, what's not

150
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:50,616
working well, how can we empower
the parts that are, like, really

151
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:54,456
valuable for people, one of the
stress points or the pain points

152
00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:58,836
that we can, like, reduce. So, I
think that's been good. And I

153
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:03,736
guess there's a little bit there
about having the ability to do

154
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:08,206
that type of thing, being just
like a friendly community, but

155
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:13,147
also, you know, not- not a service or
a product or something. It- it makes

156
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:16,147
it easier for us to say like,
"Yeah. We can- we can still just

157
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:19,767
like be us for a little bit
before we start being forecast [??], be with

158
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:20,256
people again."

159
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:26,447
Bekah: Yeah. And I think during
the time, right, after we decided

160
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:29,086
to pause membership, we were
nominated for most welcoming,

161
00:10:29,356 --> 00:10:32,866
new -- most welcoming developer
community, which we did win

162
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:37,907
at the DevRel award, which was
really fun. But I- I know that

163
00:10:37,907 --> 00:10:40,912
that was, you know, there- there's
probably a hesitancy, like, "How

164
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:44,211
can you be the most welcoming
community and not be having new

165
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:49,432
members at this point?" And for
me, I felt like it further

166
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:52,807
ensured that we are a welcoming
community because we're taking

167
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:56,706
the time to figure out how we can
best welcome people, how we can

168
00:10:56,706 --> 00:11:02,106
continue to welcome our existing
members. And in the last year,

169
00:11:02,106 --> 00:11:04,297
I've talked to a lot of
different, small community

170
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:08,346
builders, and I've seen them, you
know, fold or say like, "Hey,

171
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:13,371
we're gonna stop doing this
because we're burnt out and we're

172
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:15,912
just gonna send everybody to
Virtual Coffee. And it's- it's

173
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:19,432
like a house of cards, right?
Like, one small community folds

174
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:22,912
and then all of the people go to
the next small community, into the

175
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:25,701
next. And so, we wanted to make
sure that- that we weren't

176
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:30,621
falling with- with those
other small communities, which I-

177
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:34,341
I don't think that we felt that we
were, but you can definitely see

178
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:39,037
that coming down the line. So, for
us, it was super important to be

179
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:43,267
able to think through all of
these processes, exactly like

180
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,876
what Kirk said, like, you know,
what makes Virtual Coffee

181
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:49,417
special? How do we preserve that
intimacy and how do we scale

182
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:49,746
that?

183
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:52,736
Dan: Yeah. I don't really have
anything to add. I mean, you both- you both

184
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:55,647
kind of hit all the- all the
points that we were thinking

185
00:11:55,647 --> 00:12:00,147
about it, you know? And I'm -- our- our-
our growth chart or whatever. We

186
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:02,996
don't actually have growth chart [laughs], but
like, you know, you- you can just --

187
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:05,486
when you're in the community, you
can get a sense of it. And it's --

188
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:10,192
you know, it- it was increasing
rapidly, you know, and ... which

189
00:12:10,192 --> 00:12:13,581
is cool obviously in one- in one
part. And we- we all very much

190
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:17,001
want more people to be joining
again. Like, we're all, I think,

191
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,552
very excited about getting back
to the place where we can open

192
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:23,631
membership again. And that's
just a matter of building up

193
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:26,657
our ... you know, different
resources, building up our

194
00:12:26,657 --> 00:12:29,657
processes, and- and figuring out some-
some paths for, you know, how we want to

195
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:35,986
handle things. We have -- just recently, we took two

196
00:12:35,986 --> 00:12:39,976
steps. We did one thing where we
were able to highlight our

197
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:43,067
members that are, you know,
giving back to the community by

198
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:45,677
volunteering and in leadership
positions or- or just helping out in

199
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:48,947
different roles on our
website. So, on virtualcoffee.io/members

200
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:55,162
now, anybody
who's -- who has ... you know, who's-

201
00:12:55,162 --> 00:12:57,741
who's actively helping with the
community has- has a little tag, you

202
00:12:57,741 --> 00:13:00,201
know, based on what they're
doing. Things like room leaders,

203
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:05,991
and note takers and, you know,
the -- our-our monthly challenge team,

204
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:10,971
and everybody else. And then
after that, we have been working

205
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:13,792
last a little bit — I dunno,
the last couple months, I guess —

206
00:13:13,822 --> 00:13:20,371
on describing better ways that
people can- can join to help.

207
00:13:20,402 --> 00:13:24,481
Because we'd been kind of just
grabbing people [laughs], mostly, to- to

208
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:27,991
help. And they've been, you know --
everybody has been amazing.

209
00:13:28,022 --> 00:13:31,231
But to support more and more
people, like, we need -- like, if

210
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:35,611
we're going to scale, the
volunteers need to scale first

211
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:41,131
before the- before the members.
Do -- you know, the- the -- if you just take

212
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:46,537
our- our coffee meetings, for
example, we have awesome

213
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:50,856
team of room leaders and note
takers, and they do a great job,

214
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:54,157
but there's a limited amount of
them, right? And so, that means

215
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:56,677
there's a limited amount of
people that we can actually have

216
00:13:56,677 --> 00:14:03,157
at the meetings. And it's not
that high [laughs], honestly. And so,

217
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:06,547
the -- so, what we wanted to do:
Okay. How do we get more room

218
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:11,346
leaders and- and also hosts? So
up until ... yesterday -- so, we're

219
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:15,966
recording on- on Friday the 13th,
and so yesterday was the first

220
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:19,476
day that we had ... not a
maintainer -- host one of our

221
00:14:19,476 --> 00:14:19,000
coffees.

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Bekah: MC.

222
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,027
Dan: MC. Sorry. I- I say
host. See, this is why -- it's a- it's a bad name for it. But, but like --

223
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,172
Bekah: We're also working on
titles [laughs].

224
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:28,267
Dan: Right. We're working on
titles. But what I mean is, yeah,

225
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:32,407
MC. I-I-I always called host in my
head cuz that's what I

226
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:34,956
think of, but the person who's
running the coffee meeting.

227
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:38,976
That- that is talking to everybody. And- and it was Suze and she did

228
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:42,096
an awesome job. But that-
that sort of thing is we can't

229
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:48,126
just ... we- we- we feel very strongly
that we want these to be good

230
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:52,236
experiences, and they always are.
But they -- that- that- that's because we

231
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:55,956
put a lot of thought into
the MC stuff, and the room leaders,

232
00:14:55,956 --> 00:14:58,567
and all -- everything like that. And so,
we need to make sure that people

233
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:03,532
are supported and have
what they need to, you know,

234
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:07,042
bring good- good experiences to all the
other people. And so -- as sort of

235
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:11,302
like a top-down scaling situation [chuckles] for us. And so, that's one of

236
00:15:11,302 --> 00:15:14,812
the big reasons we needed to -- we-
we felt we- we should- we should

237
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:17,572
be pausing membership was- was
that. And it's been -- we've

238
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:22,042
gotten a lot of good
responses from people ... yeah. I

239
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:23,871
don't know if I actually said
this out loud [chuckles], but we made some-

240
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:29,121
some ... like documents and forms
and stuffs to- to make it easier

241
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:34,491
for people to- to- to volunteer for us and --
for Virtual Coffee. So, that was

242
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:36,562
the- that was the -- our next step. And
that's been going well. I don't know.

243
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,162
Bekah: And I think that makes it
easier for us, because like you

244
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:41,802
said before there wasn't a clear
process and even we'd have

245
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:45,672
members like, "Oh, I want to help.
How can I help?" And so much of,

246
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:49,601
because Virtual Coffee was not an
intentionally planned community,

247
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:52,511
it's always been like keeping up
with the needs of the community,

248
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:55,341
the excitement of the community, and
doing all these cool and fun

249
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:58,341
things. And I think we've done a
pretty good job of keeping up

250
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:02,991
with processes, but things
like that, like what- what do we

251
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:06,142
need help with? And I don't think
that's something that's

252
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:09,951
particularly a Virtual Coffee
problem. I think that anybody

253
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:14,256
who's running a community, if- if you
don't have things set up, you --

254
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:19,447
like, you know that you need
help [chuckles], but it's like, "How do I get

255
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:22,986
people? How do I onboard them?
What do- what do I really need

256
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:26,106
here?" And so, like, pausing to
take the time to think through

257
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:28,866
what do I need, what are the
processes that need to be

258
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:31,447
updated? Those are the things
that are going to help you to

259
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:35,376
scale down the road because it's
set up. I can bring in a new,

260
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:40,162
like, four new note takers this
morning. I added to our

261
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:43,522
organization and set them up with
the documentation that they need,

262
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:47,331
and walk through the processes.
And I've -- we've got a couple

263
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:50,662
more volunteers that I
reached out to as well, but all

264
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:53,932
of that needed to be set up in
advance. So when somebody says, "I

265
00:16:53,932 --> 00:16:57,621
would like to help, where can I
help?" there's a place to send

266
00:16:57,621 --> 00:16:58,101
them to.

267
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:03,029
Dan: Yeah. And like ... oh, I was
just gonna say, at the -- having-

268
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:06,075
having more people helps do things, like
we've- we've talked about adding

269
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:09,345
a day for coffees, right? But we
can't -- you know, up until now,

270
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:12,884
we've- we've only had our maintainers
being, kind of controlling

271
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:16,365
those -- that, dealing MC first for
these events. And while we're-

272
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:20,055
we're just sort of expect it then as it is. So, adding-

273
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:24,045
adding them, see, like Suze is a
big step for us and, you

274
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:27,944
know, we don't wanna just do it
willy-nilly. So, like, just like

275
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:30,525
Bekah was saying this, having all
that stuff written down and

276
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:33,404
having clear paths for people,
it's turned out very

277
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:33,795
important [chuckles].

278
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:39,089
Bekah: Yeah. And we sent out
a community survey or- or we had the

279
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:41,460
community survey that we were
posting in Slack and during our

280
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,299
Virtual Coffee meetings for a
couple of weeks to get feedback

281
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:49,170
from the community. And so, we're
also taking like, what- what does

282
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,349
the community value? So, we know
that there are things that

283
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:55,619
everybody values, but like really
getting that down, having

284
00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:01,259
conversations, having maintainers
Q&As allows us to get

285
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:06,450
feedback and really think through
what we're- we're doing. Kirk,

286
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,910
do you wanna talk a little bit
about the results of those

287
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,690
surveys? Some of the key
takeaways that we had?

288
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:15,105
Kirk: Yeah. Well, in the sort of like
overarching ourselves that we

289
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:20,355
had. First of all, generally
positive responses, which is

290
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:24,555
nice. I don't know. It's just
nice to not be told, like, "You

291
00:18:24,555 --> 00:18:31,244
suck [laughs]," in another time [??]. So, mostly positive. A lot of it was like existing

292
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:34,214
systems that people want, maybe
like a little bit more, you know?

293
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:37,964
And I think a lot of it was
maybe just like a little more

294
00:18:37,964 --> 00:18:42,650
like fidelity and we've talked
about. Like, "If I wanna volunteer,

295
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:46,069
how do I do that?" So, there are a
lot of people who weren't like --

296
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:48,799
or they're new, or they're still
sort of getting into things like,

297
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,950
"How do I do more?" And making
that really, really transparent with

298
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,779
people, with something that seemed
to resonate. Right now, we have a

299
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:02,329
few sort of like key events that
happen in the community. We have

300
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:07,085
our Lunch & Learns, we have the
Lightning Talks, but we also

301
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:09,724
have -- I guess this concept
that wouldn't be about -- like, this

302
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:14,134
Coffee Table groups, which are
really just things started by the

303
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:18,214
members where they saw like a
need or a space for something

304
00:19:18,214 --> 00:19:21,275
they were interested in and they
just self-organized. And that's

305
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:25,595
super great. And we, like, we like
those things. So there's a

306
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:30,724
question. Okay. How do we support
people who wanna do this?

307
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:36,079
How do we, again, like, avoid
some of the pitfalls or some of

308
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,140
the dangers of like doing a lot
of volunteer work, right? So it's

309
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,309
like, if you wanna do this
group, what can we help you with?

310
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:46,039
Like, what support can we give
you? What support do you need?

311
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:51,019
Can we equip you to kind of like,
have an idea of like how much

312
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:54,170
effort it's gonna take, if you
need to stop — I think it is like

313
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:58,535
most important that — if you need
to stop performing a role, can you

314
00:19:58,535 --> 00:20:01,055
do that -- communicate that in a
way that is safe for you,

315
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:05,704
comfortable for you, like minimal
pain points. So there's been

316
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,535
a lot of things like that, you
know? Basically just people

317
00:20:07,535 --> 00:20:11,434
saying like, "This stuff is going
on here. I really like it. How

318
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:14,134
can I get more involved?" And then
us figuring out a way to like,

319
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:19,154
take people's enthusiasm and then
like put them on a path to

320
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:21,404
success for what they're gonna
do, which I think is super

321
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:25,400
important, you know? Like a lot of ... I don't know.
When I think of like what it

322
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:31,839
comes down to with like these
types of initiatives, it's ... you

323
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:36,670
find two issues. Sometimes
someone has a great idea, but a

324
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,910
system's not set up for it so
they can execute it and they get

325
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,930
bummed out. Or they have idea and
they sort of like go headlong

326
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:48,640
into it and, you know, kind of
like burn through their life

327
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,974
force like a Phoenix. And
neither of those is great. So, a nice

328
00:20:53,974 --> 00:20:59,884
middle ground and it -- you know, I
think this idea of sustainable

329
00:21:00,335 --> 00:21:04,565
leadership, I think is something
is really important to us. If

330
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:07,384
you wanna lead something, we
wanna help you do it, but in a

331
00:21:07,384 --> 00:21:12,515
way where you can keep doing it
on your own terms and not feel

332
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:16,984
like you have to because of other
people, or you have to because

333
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,630
it's like, you know, just ... I wanna do
this while it provides value and

334
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,079
joy for me, and then when I'm
ready to stop, you can stop. And

335
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,460
that's okay. And I think that's
the thing we've- we've kind of gone over

336
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:34,490
this community. We like the fact
this is not a space where

337
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,750
you have to come in perfect, you
know? We like the fact that

338
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:44,765
people can grow here, there was this little space
to grow here, there's a

339
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:47,345
space to make mistakes within
reason, there's a space to

340
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:51,785
practice things that you're not
perfect at, you know? A lot of

341
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:53,835
times people hesitate, I mean even
things like, why don't you learn --

342
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,194
just like, "I've never," you know,
"I've never done speaking before,"

343
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:00,275
but like, if you haven't, this is
probably the best space to give

344
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:04,894
it a try. It's a non-hostile
audience who only is interested in

345
00:22:04,894 --> 00:22:11,359
just like supporting you as much
as possible, you know? So,

346
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,130
yeah. It- it the -- well, I was really
validated by a lot of the

347
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,549
survey responses kind of echo
what we were feeling as

348
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:24,259
maintainers and everyone seems
to kind of be on board, like

349
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,069
making this even more awesome.

350
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:29,690
Bekah: Yeah. Dan, do you wanna
talk through the things that you

351
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,240
implemented to help support our
Coffee Table groups?

352
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:36,994
Dan: Yeah. I mean, we -- the -- I think
the- the biggest thing -- the first

353
00:22:36,994 --> 00:22:40,325
thing is just the -- is just that
the form and the stuff that we've

354
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,295
been talking about a little bit
i-i-is making it available. Just

355
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,625
letting our members know that
it's- it's a thing that they

356
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:51,125
could do, you know? And then
after that, I've just kind of

357
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:54,454
scratched the surface about
supporting these groups on a

358
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:59,194
technical level. But ... you
know -- so, one of the things was-

359
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:03,365
was setting up a calendar
system so that I -- you know, people

360
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:07,355
can log in. Our- our members -- I mean,
our -- the- the group leaders can

361
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:11,375
log in and add their events,
you know, recurring events or one

362
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:16,549
off events. And then those
events get filter back out through

363
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:20,150
our website and, you know, onto our events' page. And they also -- I added

364
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:25,730
a Slack bot sort of thing that,
well, we'll- we'll send reminders from

365
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,630
that. So we moved on from
Meeting Place and are using

366
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,180
that for our events now too, and not
just the special interest group

367
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,930
stuff -- Coffee Table groups [chuckles].
Sorry. We call them the special

368
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:41,359
interest groups for a long time.
But -- so- so- so, yeah. So

369
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,144
that was like, this is like kind of
step one, is- is allowing

370
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:51,275
our group leaders to sort of
roll their own stuff, you know?

371
00:23:51,315 --> 00:23:54,005
So they don't have to ask us to
add things to the calendar, ask

372
00:23:54,005 --> 00:23:57,365
us to add things to Slack-- in Slack, you know, Slack

373
00:23:57,424 --> 00:24:03,664
reminders, and things like that.
And- and with -- along with

374
00:24:03,664 --> 00:24:08,224
that, sort of copied the
co-working room experience and [chuckles]

375
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:13,144
made it -- so that we could -- so
our group leaders could use our

376
00:24:13,144 --> 00:24:16,654
Zoom for events, which was
another sticking point because

377
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:21,095
if you don't have a paid Zoom
account, then I think you were

378
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:23,285
still limited to 40 minutes or
something like that, you know?

379
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:26,345
There's limitations for- for free
accounts. And so, having a central

380
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:30,154
place that you can trust that we
will have things to get taken

381
00:24:30,154 --> 00:24:32,285
care of and have some moderation
tools in place, things like that.

382
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:37,625
So- so, yeah. And then I
think I have -- you know, next is gonna

383
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:43,549
be some things more for general users
to log in and be able to

384
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,940
maybe RSVP for events or add
things to calendars, things like

385
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,950
that. So, that's coming down the
line. But- but, yeah. That's -- all

386
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,950
the- the- the group membership
stuff is in place right now. So

387
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,240
it's kind of- kind of exciting.

388
00:24:57,035 --> 00:25:00,154
Bekah: Yeah, I think it's been
great. And I'd like -- I would just wanna

389
00:25:00,154 --> 00:25:04,265
share what some of our Coffee
Table groups are, just so if you

390
00:25:04,325 --> 00:25:08,914
are listening, you have an idea.
We've got -- at -- well, every

391
00:25:08,914 --> 00:25:12,259
Monday, in Slack and our
announcements channel, it drops all of the

392
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:15,289
things that are happening this
week. So it gives an overview.

393
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:19,549
We've got tech interview study
group where they go through job

394
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:23,089
preparation materials, give each
other feedback, answer questions

395
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:28,069
and things like that. Meg —
who you heard from this season — is

396
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:32,539
running the accountability
buddies sessions, where it's,

397
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:37,430
again, I think job focused or- or
working on projects, that

398
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:43,605
kind of thing. We have the React
group as well. We have ... let's

399
00:25:43,605 --> 00:25:48,585
see. Indie hackers, and we've got a
new one, which is like a

400
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:52,125
Virtual Coffee speaking group
where -- actually Kirk, you and I

401
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:56,744
are up first, next week. Is that
next week, or the week after? Well,

402
00:25:56,744 --> 00:25:59,234
we're giving short speeches. So
we should prepare for those,

403
00:25:59,234 --> 00:25:59,474
right?

404
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,710
Kirk: We should really find out. If it's [chuckles] next week or few weeks.

405
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,000
Bekah: It's in the calendar for
sure.

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Kirk: There you go!

406
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,869
Bekah: So [chuckles] I should write something. I know I'm missing
some of the other groups that we

407
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:15,170
have going on there, but those
are the ones that- that I can see

408
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:21,605
right now and are coming to ...
my thoughts. So, I don't

409
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:24,664
know, just like a lot of really
fun stuff in the- the VC's speaking

410
00:26:24,664 --> 00:26:30,365
group — the Virtual Coffee, we've
refer it as VC — is a cool

411
00:26:30,365 --> 00:26:34,595
one that's just started meeting
this past week? I don't know.

412
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:37,775
The last couple of weeks. So it all kind
of blend together. So [chuckles], we- we

413
00:26:37,775 --> 00:26:41,315
met fairly recently for the first
time and kind of plan things out

414
00:26:41,315 --> 00:26:44,105
and things are growing from
there. So, there's always

415
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:48,095
something that there's a need
that can be filled or there's an

416
00:26:48,095 --> 00:26:51,589
interest like, honestly, I- I was
thinking about like, "Okay, what

417
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,880
Coffee Table groups would I like
to see?" And I don't know if this

418
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,859
fits into a Coffee Table group,
but, like, I don't know

419
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:06,785
what to call it ... Happy Hour-
Happy Hour Special Interest

420
00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:10,055
group? I -- it kind of like falls
outside of there, but like

421
00:27:10,115 --> 00:27:14,644
something low-key, let's get
together and hang out. We've done

422
00:27:14,644 --> 00:27:20,494
some happy hours or social hours
before. And- and just like seeing

423
00:27:20,494 --> 00:27:24,244
the community interact in those
ways has been a lot of fun. But

424
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:27,575
are there other groups that you
two would like to see a Virtual Coffee?

426
00:27:29,974 --> 00:27:33,994
Kirk: It's ... see, this is ... I don't
know if it's different from the

427
00:27:33,994 --> 00:27:36,335
happy hour group, but we've been
talking about VC

428
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:42,454
karaoke for like, forever.
And I'm- I'm so down. So down with the karaoke. 

429
00:27:45,005 --> 00:27:48,305
There's a -- okay. So this is
one that came up just yesterday,

430
00:27:48,305 --> 00:27:57,154
actually. I was talking -- who was I
talking to? People [Bekah chuckles]. And we were

431
00:27:57,154 --> 00:28:02,150
talking about ... oh, yeah- yeah. We were
talking about poetry. And we were like,

432
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,819
where -- if you were gonna share
your poetry and music, like, where do

433
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:09,769
you put -- content creation is
slightly different. It's not

434
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:13,819
necessarily content, right? Like,
it's just like -- it's like art for

435
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:20,420
me that I'm sharing with like
friends. So then it's like, "Hmm. Maybe

436
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,170
that goes into --" I think we have
a -- so -- do we have a channel about crafts? Is it craft --

00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:24,769
Bekah: Making stuffs.

437
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,849
Kirk: Yeah. I'm not in it cuz
I thought it was about macaroni,

438
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:37,184
but it's not [Bekah chuckles]. I get this idea. So yeah. It was -- maybe there-
maybe there's like another space

439
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:39,974
for that, but, you know, that's --
those- those are the two that

440
00:28:40,214 --> 00:28:42,434
immediately came to mind. But I
feel like there's a ton more

441
00:28:42,525 --> 00:28:48,845
like ... I don't know. I- I think since
the [chuckles] -- since we get -- we got past

442
00:28:48,845 --> 00:28:54,605
the- the time of Bryan [chuckles] making
channels [laughs], we've been a lot more

443
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:59,065
judicious about them. We made a
channel for making channels,

444
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:01,434
which I actually think has worked
out pretty well, as like giving

445
00:29:01,434 --> 00:29:05,244
people like a clear space to
discuss wanting certain channels.

446
00:29:05,755 --> 00:29:10,134
The -- yeah. What I like about
the special interest groups is

447
00:29:10,134 --> 00:29:14,275
like, it -- we don't predict them,
right? The members -- someone has

448
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:18,654
an idea, they will typically like
find some way to poll the

449
00:29:18,654 --> 00:29:22,974
community, you know? Get feedback
and like, general random, if

450
00:29:22,974 --> 00:29:26,539
there's enough interest and
people like hype enough, they give it a try.

451
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,539
And then, like, we, as the
maintainers only come in, like,

452
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:33,259
"Hey, you're doing an awesome
thing," you know, "Let's see if we

453
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:41,809
can, like, help it out with it." Yeah.
[Unintelligible] a process, too.

454
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,420
Dan: Yeah. I mean I --
What was that? What did you say?

455
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:49,190
Kirk: I mean, having a process for that
is good. It's like some things

456
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,549
end up not being like -- they
just -- it's like, okay. Like, if we have

457
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:56,079
external events, right? Which is
where people can basically, you

458
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:58,670
know, if they have a thing that's
going on outside of the

459
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,430
community, you can always
like put it in there. A lot

460
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:05,180
of stuff ends up like, well, this
is probably just an external.

461
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:08,480
Coffee Tables, or, spec- now I'm
saying special interest groups.

462
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:09,019
Dan, what have you [chuckles] --

---

463
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:13,660
Dan: Well, we call them that for
like a year. And then we figured

464
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,119
out Coffee Table groups, which I
like. It's just- it's just the

465
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,349
other one is stuck in my head.
So --

466
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:23,119
Kirk: Yeah. The- the- the key thing is that
it's- it's a -- by members for members. I

467
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,740
think that's like the- the -- sort of
the core concept, you know? So,

468
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,750
it's not like an outside person
coming in all that it's just like

469
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,200
a seminar hold by our member [??]. So if you're gonna

470
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:40,859
maybe expand it to everyone, then
it sort of, you know, the ability

471
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:46,230
to like, make sure it stays like
VC oriented will be diminished,

472
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,994
right? Like, sticking to the CoC,
there's like all these other

473
00:30:48,994 --> 00:30:51,095
things you just can't control if
it's not. So, you know.

474
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:55,619
Bekah: We- we have talked about some
cross community collaboration.

475
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,970
And I know that there has been
some talk among our members, like

476
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:06,000
what if this small interest -- oh
my, I did it now! [Deep exhales] Dan. Why you of all people --

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Dan: [Unintelligible] [Laughs]

477
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:13,954
Bekah: [Chuckles] What if our Coffee
Table groups collaborated with

478
00:31:13,954 --> 00:31:18,154
somebody else? Like, you know, had
another -- a community, a

479
00:31:18,154 --> 00:31:21,934
meetup, like, maybe freeCodeCamp
Philly. Meg was talking about

480
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:25,234
join accountability buddies. And
so there's definitely something

481
00:31:25,234 --> 00:31:28,204
that we're considering. And it -- you
know, it goes back to like, what

482
00:31:28,204 --> 00:31:31,775
are the needs of our members and
the leaders of those groups. So,

483
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:36,755
you know, it- it -- always talking things
through and figuring out like, is

484
00:31:36,755 --> 00:31:41,855
this a good fit for our
community? Is the priority of

485
00:31:41,914 --> 00:31:42,634
everything that we're doing?

486
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:47,930
Kirk: Yeah. We, you know,
acknowledging that we can't be

487
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:55,910
everything for all people. And
also like we can't ... ourselves

488
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,359
necessarily, like, handle like every --
like there's lots of good things

489
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,660
that members might want or like,
but we're just not equipped to

490
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,529
provide those things. So if there's like
a great partnership with somebody

491
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:11,279
else who is doing that, then
that's awesome. Brian Rinaldi

492
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,910
comes to mind with like
cfe.dev, you know? Like,

493
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,799
consistent guest speakers, great
quality talks, like, that's

494
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,940
something to takes a whole team
to organize and through all that

495
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,240
consistent basis. We, you and I
have the battle [??] for that if he

496
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,210
does. And so like letting
members, "Hey, every two weeks,

497
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,160
you're getting like a high
quality thing that you can just

498
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,335
check out," feels good. Like, everyone
seems both sides are sort of like

499
00:32:36,335 --> 00:32:39,305
getting something out of it. So,
if there's ways to do more of

500
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:44,525
that, it's great. Yeah. But
those do always require like

501
00:32:44,585 --> 00:32:48,724
extended -- you just have to like
work them out more because now

502
00:32:48,724 --> 00:32:52,474
you have to like check in that
this other group are aligned with

503
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:55,954
you, you gotta figure out timing,
you gotta -- you have your own

504
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:58,234
cadence of work, they have their
own cadence work, it becomes this

505
00:32:58,234 --> 00:33:03,740
thing, you know, but -- or not. I don't
think we're opposed to like

506
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:08,390
anything that doesn't bring value
for them in.

507
00:33:10,454 --> 00:33:15,500
Bekah: Yes, 100%. So, you
know, as we're working through

508
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,799
all of this stuff, there's
obviously still pain points that

509
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,650
we need to solve. So I thought
maybe we could talk a little bit

510
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,410
about, you know, some of the
things that we're still trying to

511
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:30,319
work through and- and maybe some
of the ideas that we have or

512
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:35,059
just thoughts that we are
trying to work through.

513
00:33:37,345 --> 00:33:40,970
Dan: Yeah. So I [clears throat], excuse me, I
think one of our based -- I mean, we've

514
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,799
talked about some of the
struggles and, you know, some of

515
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,009
them when we were talking about
why we pause memberships

516
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:50,539
wh-with regards to having
leadership support and things

517
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:54,650
like that. But a-another side of
that was -- is just handling

518
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:58,579
incoming members, right? So I- I
think probably a lot of people

519
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,890
have had the experience of
joining some community at this

520
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:05,180
quarter, Slack, or whatever,
and being just overwhelmed [chuckles], or

521
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,949
not having any idea what to
do, or- or maybe it's a little

522
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:13,699
clear, but it's still just a huge
community with a million channels

523
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:21,815
a-a-and no, you know, personal connection for
you. And so, you put your

524
00:34:21,815 --> 00:34:24,275
name and [chuckles], you know, you fill out
the intro thing and say, "Hello

525
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:26,255
everybody," and, you know, some
people react and say hi and

526
00:34:26,255 --> 00:34:30,304
stuff, and then- and then it's
kinda -- right [chuckles]? I wouldn't want

527
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:32,554
that to be -- I mean, if peep- if that's
what happens in Virtual Coffee

528
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:36,065
that, you know, so be it for- for
a person, but in general, we

529
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:39,815
don't want that to be that case,
right? And so our -- and this is

530
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:43,715
why we've stuck pretty hard with
our- our -- how you join Virtual

531
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:48,635
Coffee is by coming to one of our
coffees, right? First, before any

532
00:34:48,844 --> 00:34:53,465
Slack invites happen, things like
that. [Clears throat] One of the difficulties

533
00:34:53,465 --> 00:35:00,454
with that is- is -- it was a very
manual process, right? The --

534
00:35:00,485 --> 00:35:04,144
you know, Zoom has its own
authentication stuff, and there's

535
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:09,800
no way to have people signed into
like a Zoom account, all of the

536
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,920
same account. Otherwise -- I mean, it --
or- or unless they were paid members,

537
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,570
right? So if you are on a work
Zoom or something, you know, that- that

538
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:18,920
your work is paying for every
single seat [chuckles]. And so, that's

539
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,099
obviously not a- a solution for us. So
when you join a Virtual Coffee's

540
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:25,099
Zoom, you're just joining on your
own account, and you can fill out

541
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:28,670
whatever details you want.
There's no way for us to managing

542
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,269
that. What that means is
there's no auto -- there's -- it's

543
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:37,519
very complicated and possibly
sometimes impossible to connect a

544
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,639
Zoom account with a person, you
know? And whether they've joined

545
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,610
or not before, and things like
that. And so, our solution was

546
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:46,760
just to have people fill out the
membership form and, you know,

547
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,019
we'd have a little link after
coffees and they would fill out

548
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:54,755
the form and then we would
essentially go and make sure that

549
00:35:54,755 --> 00:35:58,594
they actually came and then send
them a Slack invite, sort of all

550
00:35:58,594 --> 00:36:01,144
manually -- wa- wait, peep- thus,
maintainers were just doing

551
00:36:01,144 --> 00:36:04,175
that. And that was hard too,
you know? I mean, that was time

552
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:07,324
consuming even when there was
just five people that, you know,

553
00:36:07,324 --> 00:36:11,885
joined that week, it took up
time. And we have more and more

554
00:36:11,885 --> 00:36:15,784
people coming, things like
that. And, so, that's one of the

555
00:36:15,784 --> 00:36:18,664
challenges that I'd like to nail
down i-is just like what- what it means

556
00:36:18,664 --> 00:36:23,105
to be a member? How to- how to
join things, you know?

557
00:36:23,195 --> 00:36:29,255
Those sorts of topics, right? And
then how can we- how can we keep

558
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:33,454
the sort of intimate nature of-
of joining Virtual Coffee

559
00:36:33,844 --> 00:36:36,184
while supporting multiple
members -- you know, more and

560
00:36:36,184 --> 00:36:40,324
more, a larger and larger group
of people, and then also how to

561
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:44,195
onboard them gracefully and
things like that. Not overwhelm

562
00:36:44,195 --> 00:36:48,739
people and not call with them
with, you know, a million

563
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,070
channels and huge group of people
that they don't know anything

564
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:55,610
about. So, that's -- we -- we've- we've
been talking a lot about that

565
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,260
too over the past few
months.

566
00:36:58,525 --> 00:37:01,074
Bekah: Yeah. And along with that,
when you have more people, you're

567
00:37:01,074 --> 00:37:04,494
gonna need more moderation,
right? So for us, moderation

568
00:37:04,494 --> 00:37:10,105
hasn't been a huge issue, but as
you onboard more people and have

569
00:37:10,554 --> 00:37:13,795
less of a personal relationship
with every single person that

570
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:17,880
comes in, it- it becomes a little bit
trickier, right? And so you wanna

571
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,360
make sure that you're prepared
for something that might happen

572
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,739
and dealing with those types of
issues, and making sure that

573
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:28,650
everybody has access to that
information that they need. Not

574
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:33,179
everybody needs access to all of
the information. And so, providing

575
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,769
each group of volunteers with
that information, making sure

576
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:40,769
that they're up to date and can
communicate openly with each

577
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:45,804
other when something needs to be
updated or changed is -- those are

578
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:48,985
also priorities and pain points
that we're trying to work

579
00:37:48,985 --> 00:37:51,688
through. Kirk, do you have
anything to add?

580
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,778
Kirk: I think we should go
back to trial by combat for

581
00:37:55,778 --> 00:38:00,159
membership. I think we should go
back to the old ways. Now,

582
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:03,818
no. I think you guys, you hit
the nail on the head. I was just

583
00:38:05,918 --> 00:38:12,623
thinking through things
being conscientious. You can only

584
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,853
get so far, just kind of like
going with the flow and

585
00:38:16,853 --> 00:38:19,313
eventually, like, if the flow
becomes like a delusion, you kinda

586
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:24,744
need to have a plan.
Yeah. And it's- it's- it's just us sort of

587
00:38:25,014 --> 00:38:28,313
being a lot more thoughtful about
stuff and kind of stepping back

588
00:38:28,313 --> 00:38:34,128
and saying, "Okay, if something
works now, why does it work? Is

589
00:38:34,128 --> 00:38:38,659
there a way to like, clarify
that so we can reference why, new

590
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:42,289
people can reference why," and
like, we start, you know, building that up.

591
00:38:42,978 --> 00:38:46,878
You know, we recently had
like something that make -- the maintainers

592
00:38:46,878 --> 00:38:49,719
were discussing and were like,
"Hey, is this in the Code of

593
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:52,099
Conduct?" And we were like, "No,"
like, "We should probably like put

594
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:55,309
it in there," right? Just so we
don't forget later if it happens

595
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:58,278
again, there's like something
that we can reference and go,

596
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:01,893
"Well, we're not just making it up
on the fly as we go along." Or, I

597
00:39:01,893 --> 00:39:05,764
mean, we are, but like the things
that we wanna keep [chuckles], we're

598
00:39:05,764 --> 00:39:12,054
putting it somewhere where it- it
can, you know, stay. Yeah, I don't know.

599
00:39:12,123 --> 00:39:17,043
And there's something about like
habits and traditions. If

600
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:22,324
something is good and provides
good value for you, you should

601
00:39:22,324 --> 00:39:25,083
like find a way to keep it. And
if something is not providing

602
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:28,818
good value for you, then, like, you
should set it free. But it's

603
00:39:28,818 --> 00:39:31,128
hard to do that if you're not
keeping track of those things.

604
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:33,000
So, yeah.

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Bekah: But I think along --

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,648
Kirk: [Unintelligible] thing, we can totally ... I'm ready. Dan, are you ready? Dan is [unintelligible].


605
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:44,353
Dan: I'm always ready.

00:39:44,353 --> 00:39:48,000
Kirk: There you go. Bekah, you're ready?

606
00:39:48,403 --> 00:39:52,393
Bekah: Always. Always ready.
I- I think along with all this

607
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:55,724
too, when we're thinking about
these things, we also have to

608
00:39:55,724 --> 00:40:00,253
think about them on a much larger
scale, right? So, if it works now,

609
00:40:00,253 --> 00:40:08,778
will it work if we have 500
more people? And the biggest

610
00:40:09,994 --> 00:40:13,054
value of Virtual Coffee, I think,
comes from the intimacy those

611
00:40:13,054 --> 00:40:18,063
small group connections. And so, I
say 500 people and like, that

612
00:40:18,063 --> 00:40:20,853
sounds scary to me. But, you know,
there's potential for that.

613
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:25,324
There -- we would love to have as
many people as we can, if we can

614
00:40:25,324 --> 00:40:29,284
replicate that same intimacy. And
so trying to figure out how do

615
00:40:29,284 --> 00:40:33,603
you do that? If you add another
coffee chat, are- are 500 people

616
00:40:33,603 --> 00:40:37,583
just going to suddenly appear in
Slack? I mean, they wouldn't

617
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:41,034
suddenly appear right there.
We'll be [chuckles] -- we're not going to get

618
00:40:41,034 --> 00:40:45,918
500 new people overnight. But
that's something that we have to

619
00:40:45,918 --> 00:40:50,028
think about. I don't think
it's bad to have another pause

620
00:40:50,028 --> 00:40:53,239
and membership in the future. Now
there are some communities that

621
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:56,838
have opened membership as one-
one month during a quarter or

622
00:40:56,838 --> 00:41:01,414
something. Or one week they
onboard new folks who are coming

623
00:41:01,414 --> 00:41:05,193
into the community and otherwise
they're closed. So, there are a

624
00:41:05,193 --> 00:41:08,974
lot of different ways that you
can build that into the process,

625
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:13,713
give everybody a break, kind of
like a vacation to pause,

626
00:41:13,713 --> 00:41:17,643
breathe, think things through.
But, you know, ultimately we

627
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:22,023
have to be thinking about how do
we replicate — exactly what Kirk

628
00:41:22,023 --> 00:41:25,344
was saying — is- is good about this
community as we scale as well.

629
00:41:27,614 --> 00:41:31,278
Kirk: Yeah. And there's something
that's been bouncing around in my

630
00:41:31,278 --> 00:41:36,708
head a lot about, like, community
size. And I have a working

631
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:44,358
hypothesis, which is that I ... don't
think community size is

632
00:41:44,358 --> 00:41:47,389
necessarily a problem. I feel
like it's almost like a

633
00:41:47,389 --> 00:41:53,809
precursor, like, having the
community getting bigger can lead

634
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:55,789
to other things. Like, those
things are actually the problem

635
00:41:55,818 --> 00:41:59,943
or like a lack of certain things. But if
you know what it is and you're

636
00:41:59,943 --> 00:42:03,393
prepared for it, I don't think
it's like -- so, like, obviously

637
00:42:03,603 --> 00:42:07,083
suddenly having 500 members would
probably be a bad thing, you

638
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:11,673
know? But I guess if there was an
increase in 500 members over

639
00:42:11,673 --> 00:42:14,103
the course of like 10 years,
like -- I don't know. That's a

640
00:42:14,103 --> 00:42:16,833
bad thing. So the problem might
not be the 500 members. It's just

641
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:20,943
like, what does it mean when new
people enter the group, right?

642
00:42:20,943 --> 00:42:29,164
And we found ... too many people
in at once, it starts to get a

643
00:42:29,164 --> 00:42:29,884
little-

644
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:32,903
Bekah: Dilutes the experience or
something.

645
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:36,523
Kirk: -it gets a little -- yeah. Well, it gets a
little -- it's like more strangers

646
00:42:36,523 --> 00:42:40,063
in a room. And as much as
possible we try and like remove

647
00:42:40,063 --> 00:42:43,873
the feeling of like strangers in
a room, you know? Like, there -- it's like, this is

648
00:42:43,873 --> 00:42:47,623
like friend-I-don't-know-too-well-yet versus

649
00:42:47,623 --> 00:42:52,773
like, person that I- I- I just -- I
don't want to interact with. But

650
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:56,543
we also know like having fresh
new faces is just a way of -- it

651
00:42:56,583 --> 00:43:00,634
just -- it keeps things fun, it
keeps things healthy.

652
00:43:01,923 --> 00:43:04,833
Communities are dynamic systems.
People enter, people leave,

653
00:43:04,864 --> 00:43:09,634
people return. And like, being able
to like handle all those steps of

654
00:43:09,634 --> 00:43:12,664
your journey as a community
member is really important for

655
00:43:12,664 --> 00:43:16,804
like having a good for me, you
know? So, yeah. Let's say we have

656
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:18,574
like a thousand members, but
we're probably not gonna have

657
00:43:18,574 --> 00:43:21,603
like a thousand people active at
the same time. They'll come in

658
00:43:21,603 --> 00:43:25,594
waves, they'll come and go, and
it- it, you know, there's -- I

659
00:43:25,594 --> 00:43:28,143
think there's a way of like
living in that space that can

660
00:43:28,143 --> 00:43:32,224
feel really good. Like, very
quickly you figured out, "Oh, it's

661
00:43:32,224 --> 00:43:37,594
not so much." Zooms can have lots
of people. As long as when people

662
00:43:37,594 --> 00:43:40,864
finally start talking, they're in
like a small enough space that it

663
00:43:40,864 --> 00:43:43,923
feels comfortable. And that's how
the breakout room started.

664
00:43:44,643 --> 00:43:47,463
So -- and I think there's like
similar techniques, so we can

665
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:52,204
grow and not necessarily it's
like ... I don't know. This will

666
00:43:52,204 --> 00:43:58,143
become like a thesis at some
point. But the key metric may not

667
00:43:58,143 --> 00:44:02,824
be total numbers, but sort of
like, how are the people

668
00:44:02,824 --> 00:44:06,003
interacting with other people?
Are they still getting a chance

669
00:44:06,003 --> 00:44:09,514
for like intimate moments with a
few members at any given time

670
00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:12,559
and we can make that work? And we
think we can make that work. We

671
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:14,568
also think we can have like the
greatest conference of all time.

672
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:16,039
We have big thoughts.

673
00:44:16,474 --> 00:44:17,000
Bekah: Next summer.

00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Kirk: Am I right?

674
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:26,809
Bekah:  Well, I'm gonna
push back a little bit, Kirk. Cuz I disagree slightly with
what you're saying. I do

675
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:30,438
think the total number matters.
And I keep going back to -- it's

676
00:44:30,438 --> 00:44:34,849
Dunbar's number that you can
maintain 150 connections at once.

677
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:41,219
And I think that- that allows for
Slack intimacy. So, I think that

678
00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:43,739
we also have to think through two
things here, right? We're

679
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:46,469
thinking about, like, what does it
look like, in the breakout rooms,

680
00:44:46,498 --> 00:44:49,889
in Tuesdays and Thursdays? We
like to keep it to eight to 10

681
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:55,684
people per room. And I think that- that
is- that is good. But I also

682
00:44:55,684 --> 00:44:59,463
think that having that small
experience where you know

683
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:02,853
people in Slack is important. And
it is tricky for the reasons that

684
00:45:02,853 --> 00:45:06,213
you say. Because people come in
and they come out all of the time,

685
00:45:06,543 --> 00:45:09,423
you know? Somebody has -- is
super active, and then they get a

686
00:45:09,423 --> 00:45:13,563
new job, and then you don't hear
from them as much, right? Or they

687
00:45:13,563 --> 00:45:18,003
can't participate anymore, which
is totally fine. So it's a -- this like

688
00:45:19,009 --> 00:45:24,048
constant flow of people coming
in, so, you know, we might have --

689
00:45:24,378 --> 00:45:26,898
might say we have 500 people in
Slack, but we certainly don't

690
00:45:26,898 --> 00:45:31,579
have 500 active people in Slack.
But I do think that that idea of

691
00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:37,039
having 150 people says something
for the intimacy of the group.

692
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:40,338
It's like their extended network
of people. You can go to an

693
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:43,009
in-person conference and be like,
"Oh, I know that person there from

694
00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:46,393
Virtual Coffee. So I'm going to
talk to them because I'm standing

695
00:45:46,393 --> 00:45:53,534
in this corner alone by myself."
Maybe that was me [chuckles]. But I- I

696
00:45:54,103 --> 00:45:57,284
would like to figure out, or I --
you know, I think that we're

697
00:45:57,284 --> 00:46:00,873
making progress towards
figuring out how to maintain that

698
00:46:00,903 --> 00:46:05,583
intimacy in both places. So I
think that maybe there is a world

699
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:11,403
where we do have 500 people in
what- whatever platform we're on, but

700
00:46:11,403 --> 00:46:18,393
can still maintain that, like, 150
person asynchronous

701
00:46:18,454 --> 00:46:22,384
communication intimacy, as well
as those breakout room

702
00:46:22,443 --> 00:46:23,373
communications.

703
00:46:24,478 --> 00:46:28,048
Dan: Yeah, I- I- I agree. And I- I
think that [clear throat] to like, kind of

704
00:46:28,048 --> 00:46:31,768
combine what both of you were
saying together, you know, it's the --

705
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,798
like the large number isn't the met-
isn't the important metric, you

706
00:46:34,798 --> 00:46:36,929
know? And I think that's the
biggest, like, thing that I love,

707
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:41,373
what- what was Kirk was saying was
like, if we- we- we aggressively

708
00:46:41,373 --> 00:46:45,724
don't have metrics [laughs], but like,
if we did, like, that — and it was

709
00:46:45,724 --> 00:46:48,434
possible — that would be the thing
to measure on, right? Is, like, are

710
00:46:48,434 --> 00:46:50,764
our members making intimate
connections, you know? Are our

711
00:46:50,764 --> 00:46:57,753
members, like, part- part
of a group, you know? You know

712
00:46:57,753 --> 00:47:00,634
what I mean? And so ... and I
totally agree with you, Bekah.

713
00:47:00,664 --> 00:47:04,233
Like, i-it's like, it- it -- when you say,
oh, it -- the number, it doesn't

714
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:09,934
matter, you know? It's -- you're gonna --
like, the number does matter,

715
00:47:09,963 --> 00:47:14,614
right? And whether that 150
numbers is- is, you know, feels right

716
00:47:14,614 --> 00:47:18,184
or not is- is probably up in the
air. But like, it's- it's one of

717
00:47:18,184 --> 00:47:22,083
those things where it's ... and
this is why we pause membership.

718
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,123
And this is why we're like
thinking so hard is because we

719
00:47:24,123 --> 00:47:30,994
want to be able to keep the- to
keep the ... intimacy and the

720
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:36,768
sort of shape of our [chuckles] community
while growing. And that's hard and not a

721
00:47:36,768 --> 00:47:39,889
lot of people have done it. And we
think we can crack it, and I

722
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:44,088
think we're pretty close,
honestly. And -- but, yeah.

723
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:48,018
It's- it's -- and it's very
important to us, I think. And

724
00:47:48,018 --> 00:47:50,898
I think it's important to our
community members as well. So

725
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:55,369
I, you know, when you are on out-
outside of the community of

726
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:58,699
Virtual Coffee, or maybe you're
brand new member, it might not be

727
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:02,753
as clear. Or maybe if you haven't
thought about it [laughs], you know, and-

728
00:48:02,753 --> 00:48:06,963
and you just kind of along for
the ride. I know for- for my -- at

729
00:48:06,963 --> 00:48:10,324
least personally, like sometimes
I just don't -- I don't think about

730
00:48:10,324 --> 00:48:13,534
why something feels great, or like
why something is because I enjoy

731
00:48:13,563 --> 00:48:16,264
it, you know what I mean? And
that's okay too [laughs]. Like, it's

732
00:48:16,264 --> 00:48:19,673
okay to just enjoy things. But
like, this is why we wanted to

733
00:48:19,673 --> 00:48:21,934
talk about this. This is- this is the other
side of the coin. And it's like [clear throat],

734
00:48:23,704 --> 00:48:27,153
we use it so that we can help
support it. We are thinking very hard

735
00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:33,079
about why, you know? And- and- and how we
can do more. So, yeah. And it's-

736
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:36,259
it's hard, but it's fun. It's
also fun and very gratifying too.

737
00:48:36,259 --> 00:48:36,528
So ...

738
00:48:37,483 --> 00:48:37,994
Kirk: There are people --

739
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:38,539
Dan: I'm excited.

740
00:48:39,403 --> 00:48:43,273
Kirk: Yeah. So I'm just gonna-
just gonna set the tone by

741
00:48:43,273 --> 00:48:46,934
saying a bunch of buzzwords
related to this scalability,

742
00:48:47,443 --> 00:48:52,864
continuous integration,
[chuckles] continuous deployment. Because I

743
00:48:52,864 --> 00:48:55,594
can't help -- even as we're talking
about this and like, "I dunno. Like,

744
00:48:55,594 --> 00:48:57,934
kind of feels like that other
stuff that I talk too much about."

745
00:48:58,503 --> 00:49:02,824
[Unintelligible] it's- it's sort of -- it's-
it's the same -- it's- it's a

746
00:49:02,824 --> 00:49:07,893
similar concept of ... there is
a thing that you are a part of

747
00:49:07,893 --> 00:49:13,233
and you're working on and, you
know, if- if that big core

748
00:49:13,233 --> 00:49:15,963
concept is there, and like the
people are there, and the energy

749
00:49:15,963 --> 00:49:20,884
is there, it grows. And that's good.
But there are different problems

750
00:49:20,884 --> 00:49:25,384
at different sizes. And like part
of keeping something going is

751
00:49:25,384 --> 00:49:30,483
knowing like, not just how to be
the like plucky up and coming

752
00:49:30,483 --> 00:49:34,293
thing, but also how to be this
sort of like mature, ongoing

753
00:49:34,293 --> 00:49:37,893
thing. And we're- we're at
that point. Which is a good point

754
00:49:37,893 --> 00:49:42,153
to be, you know? I don't know
what the- the tech equivalent is.

755
00:49:42,454 --> 00:49:45,844
Series C ... I don't know the words.

756
00:49:46,054 --> 00:49:49,443
Bekah: [Chuckles] That's right. We're Series
C community.

757
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:52,469
Kirk: Sure. That sounds fine.

758
00:49:52,943 --> 00:49:53,784
Dan: Capital C.

00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Bekah: Yeah.

759
00:49:55,949 --> 00:49:56,599
Kirk: You can tell the nearest --

760
00:49:58,773 --> 00:50:01,833
Dan: Or a capital C plus plus
community [laughs].

761
00:50:03,148 --> 00:50:03,599
Kirk: Oh, no.

00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Bekah: Not, Dan.

762
00:50:05,853 --> 00:50:07,923
Dan: I see if I can get Kirk to
yell at me about C++

763
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:08,074
again [laughs].

764
00:50:10,329 --> 00:50:19,159
Kirk: I mean, I didn't yell at you. You were just [Dan laughs] like -- you were like walk the difference between C# and C++.
And then I immediately thought of

765
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:25,668
like a thousand thoughts at a time. I'm 
like, "Will you give [??] it back or watch it," you know?

766
00:50:25,909 --> 00:50:26,989
Dan: Oh, man.

767
00:50:27,338 --> 00:50:31,088
Bekah: Dan, you're derailing us.
We have done so well. We- we-

00:50:31,088 --> 00:50:31,088
Dan: I -- listen. I --

768
00:50:31,088 --> 00:50:36,009
Bekah: -recovered from the initial intro
question and then we were -- we're

769
00:50:36,018 --> 00:50:37,059
good. And then you were like-

770
00:50:37,188 --> 00:50:37,728
Dan: I have a --

771
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,228
Bekah: -I'm going to break this up before
the end of the podcast.

772
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,958
Dan: I just -- there is- there is a set limit of the
amount of time that I can be

773
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:49,759
serious for [laughs] the amount of time
straight. I'm sorry. I've -- I feel like I'm

774
00:50:49,759 --> 00:50:51,768
proud of us too. I feel like we
held it together for a long time.

775
00:50:52,188 --> 00:50:56,614
And we had some good- some
good thoughts and stuff. But then Kirk

776
00:50:56,614 --> 00:50:58,713
started yelling at me about C++
and it all just went up from there.

777
00:50:58,744 --> 00:51:00,333
Bekah: He didn't yell at you during
this podcast.

778
00:51:00,393 --> 00:51:03,153
Dan: Yeah, no, no. I had him do it. Yeah.
No, it's -- that's what- that's exactly what

779
00:51:03,153 --> 00:51:04,923
happened. We're all --

780
00:51:07,478 --> 00:51:08,373
Kirk: [Unintelligible] you let me do it. It is ... this was [laughs] ... one [unintelligible].

781
00:51:08,373 --> 00:51:10,983
Bekah: Okay, listen. I think the
key takeaway from this podcast is

782
00:51:10,983 --> 00:51:14,943
Dan is the instigator in every,
every one of these situations,

783
00:51:14,943 --> 00:51:18,423
okay. Go back and listen to all
the podcast episodes. It is Dan.

784
00:51:18,483 --> 00:51:18,753
Every time.

785
00:51:18,813 --> 00:51:21,114
Dan: Nope. There's always
somebody else there. And there --

786
00:51:21,184 --> 00:51:21,454
the -- their- their fault.

787
00:51:21,764 --> 00:51:23,054
Bekah: Then it's- it's you [??] [chuckles].

788
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:26,838
Dan: If I was just on my own, I would get in no
trouble.

00:51:26,838 --> 00:51:26,838
Bekah: Oh yeah.

789
00:51:26,838 --> 00:51:34,429
Dan: And that's not true [laughs]. Oh- oh, also -- oh, no, this will
be out ... this is gonna come out

790
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:36,469
in a couple of weeks. So we'll
already have a couple, but Kirk

791
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:38,748
and I are starting a new
streaming series called

792
00:51:38,778 --> 00:51:41,000
TypeScript Tuesdays. And --

00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Kirk: I just want to --

793
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,818
Dan: So, there'll be a couple of -- so- so come find us on the Virtual
Coffee's stream on Twitch. It's VirtualCoffeeIO-

794
00:51:47,693 --> 00:51:48,204
Kirk: I just wanna-

00:51:47,693 --> 00:51:48,204
Bekah: VirtualCoffeeIO.

795
00:51:48,228 --> 00:51:51,829
Dan: -I think like that. But,
yeah. I imagine that Kirk is

796
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:55,429
going to be yelling at me a lot
there too. So if you like hearing

797
00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:59,389
Kirk yell at me [laughs], he's holding his
breath very aggressively right

798
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:05,028
now. So [Dan and Bekah laugh], come join us on
Twitch every Tuesday as well [laughs].

799
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,423
Bekah: Yeah. And I think that's
something that we're working on

800
00:52:08,423 --> 00:52:15,074
too. Like, while membership is
closes, how do we provide ... nope.

801
00:52:15,103 --> 00:52:17,173
My brain stopped. How do we
provide --

802
00:52:17,313 --> 00:52:19,833
Kirk: Finding [unintelligible] spaces where we get to
interact with people outside of

803
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:20,253
the community?

804
00:52:21,193 --> 00:52:23,000
Bekah: Yes. Value to the external
tech community.

00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Dan: Yes.

805
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,403
Bekah: That was what I like to go. 

806
00:52:24,664 --> 00:52:28,000
Dan: Yes! Oh! And Bekah started
that Twitter ... that was --

00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Bekah: Chat. Yes!

807
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,414
Dan: Tweet -- Twitter chat. That's what we call it. Yeah. Yeah.

808
00:52:31,728 --> 00:52:32,659
Bekah: Yeah. So --

809
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:32,914
Dan: How did that go?

810
00:52:33,619 --> 00:52:37,009
Bekah: It went pretty well.
It was fun. I have some ideas for

811
00:52:37,009 --> 00:52:42,259
some ways to update it. So,
basically I took the intro

812
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:47,389
question and the backpocket topic
and put it out there for

813
00:52:47,389 --> 00:52:51,739
asynchronous Twitter chat last
week. I did it on -- I think, a

814
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:56,239
Wednesday. So that was prior to
doing the Thursday coffee. And

815
00:52:56,268 --> 00:53:00,559
I'd love to be able to combine
those two. So if we have related

816
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,938
topics, then what might work
in the future is having an intro

817
00:53:04,938 --> 00:53:08,719
question for people to get
to know each other and including

818
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:11,418
both of those conversations. And,
you know, both of our- our

819
00:53:11,418 --> 00:53:14,898
members who weren't able to
attend can engage in those and

820
00:53:15,168 --> 00:53:18,289
the external community as well.
So, we'll try it out for a while,

821
00:53:18,289 --> 00:53:22,568
see how it goes. And
hopefully people will find value in it.

822
00:53:23,673 --> 00:53:25,534
Kirk: My topics will never be
related [chuckles].

823
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:30,168
Bekah: [Chuckles] They --- Kirk. We're going to
meet on Monday and we're going to

824
00:53:30,168 --> 00:53:30,918
figure it out.

825
00:53:31,099 --> 00:53:36,344
Kirk: My topics only exist to sow
the seeds of chaos. And then I

826
00:53:36,344 --> 00:53:38,923
have to spend half a day feeling --

827
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:43,728
Bekah: Loki. You're Loki. I think next
time we do this, we should -- we --

828
00:53:43,728 --> 00:53:49,188
our intro question should be
like, what character -- what

829
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:54,000
super villain would one of the
other co-host B.

00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Dan: Hm. I'll put --

830
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,699
Bekah: So, like you, Dan, would have to say Kirk's super
villain character, Kirk --

831
00:54:02,188 --> 00:54:02,278
Kirk: So you're talking through him. You just say --

832
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:04,909
Dan: Okay. But we're saving-
we're saving this for next time.

833
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:06,539
Kirk: Yeah, I'm like -- I'm putting --

834
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,719
Bekah: Or unless you- unless you
have it now.

835
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:10,289
Kirk: Putting the thought in your
head now. [Unintelligible] Doctor Doom. He's evil.

836
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:14,208
Dan: I don't- I don't- I don't have to think about it -- yeah. Wait. Doctor- Doctor Doom? That what you said?

837
00:54:14,509 --> 00:54:17,148
Kirk: Yes. Wait, what was that
tone? Whoa. Whoa-whoa-whoa.

838
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:19,309
Dan: Oh, I thought you said Doctor
Who for a second. And I was a bit like,

839
00:54:19,309 --> 00:54:20,628
Doctor Who. I don't think he's a
villain.

840
00:54:21,128 --> 00:54:21,369
Kirk: Ah [unintelligible].

841
00:54:21,498 --> 00:54:22,998
Dan: When you said Doctor Doom, and then makes more
sense.

842
00:54:23,688 --> 00:54:27,548
Kirk: I can- I can upset an
entire fandom right now [laughs].

843
00:54:30,228 --> 00:54:33,829
Dan: [Laughs] I mean, go for it. I -- I'm
not a Doctor Who -- I mean, I'm not a

844
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:34,000
not-fan-

00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Kirk: You can [unintelligible] --

845
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,679
Dan: -but I'm not a fan
either, so you're not gonna make me upset.

846
00:54:36,884 --> 00:54:39,733
Bekah: I've only seen one episode of
Doctor Who and I think mannequins

847
00:54:39,733 --> 00:54:42,523
came alive or something. And I
was like, it was not for me.

848
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:46,759
Kirk: They call themselves "Whovians" and
it sounds like children [unintelligible].

849
00:54:47,983 --> 00:54:48,000
Bekah: You mean from "Whoville"? With-

00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Kirk: Exactly! [Unintelligible]

00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,048
Bekah: -little Cindy Lou Who?
Holding hands and sing?

850
00:54:51,168 --> 00:54:54,889
Dan: Cindy Lou Whovian.

851
00:54:54,889 --> 00:54:55,679
Kirk: What were we talking about?

852
00:54:57,518 --> 00:54:59,978
Bekah: What a great podcast this
is and we're glad that everybody

853
00:54:59,978 --> 00:55:04,059
has listened to [crosstalk 00:55:01] all of Season
5. Come back for Season 6,

854
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:05,199
to hear answers [laughs].

00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000 
Dan: Yes. [Laughs] Please- please stay subscribed.

855
00:55:05,733 --> 00:55:05,884
Kirk: If you're listening -- 

856
00:55:06,728 --> 00:55:10,148
Bekah: If you like our podcast, please
give us 5 stars and write a

857
00:55:10,148 --> 00:55:13,298
comment to help other people find
our podcast too.

858
00:55:13,548 --> 00:55:18,469
Dan: Yes. If you write a comment that ... oh, I was gonna say

859
00:55:18,469 --> 00:55:24,000
something ... [laughs] I don't want to
prejudge the comments.

00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Kirk: Dan speak --

860
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,438
Dan: I was gonna say, if you write a
comment that's interesting, we

861
00:55:27,438 --> 00:55:28,000
might read it on the podcast.

00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Bekah: Yes.

862
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,673
Dan: But like, don't make that -- you know, don't let that stop you
from writing a comment that is ... not

863
00:55:35,673 --> 00:55:36,063
interesting [laughs].

864
00:55:36,153 --> 00:55:38,000
Bekah: We find every comment interesting.

00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Dan: Yes [laughs]!

00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,833
Bekah: So write the comment.

865
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:43,264
Dan: We would hear from
everybody. So, yeah. If you

866
00:55:43,264 --> 00:55:46,744
wanna send us any questions
that you'd like us to answer in

867
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:50,043
the future or any ideas for
the podcast, things like that,

868
00:55:50,164 --> 00:55:54,483
we're always excited to hear
any feedback, or questions, or

869
00:55:54,483 --> 00:55:57,543
anything like that. So, yeah,
podcast@virtualcoffee.io,

870
00:55:57,963 --> 00:56:01,534
or Twitter, or Slack, or any of
that stuff too.

871
00:56:03,114 --> 00:56:04,853
Bekah: Yeah. Thanks joining us for
Season 5.

872
00:56:05,059 --> 00:56:06,018
Dan: Yeah. Thank you.

873
00:56:06,518 --> 00:56:12,409
Kirk: Thanks for coming to MY
podcast [Dan and Bekah chuckle]. See you later on MY podcast. Like, I let

874
00:56:12,409 --> 00:56:17,298
Bekah and Dan be on because I'm
nice and I never yell.

875
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:20,284
Bekah: Thanks for allowing us to
be on your podcast, Kirk.

876
00:56:20,469 --> 00:56:21,759
Kirk: You're very welcome.

877
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:27,079
Dan: Kirk, I'll talk to you on
Tuesday when ar- arguing with

878
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:28,219
you about tip- TypeScript [chuckles].

879
00:56:28,809 --> 00:56:30,458
Kirk: With hushed tones. And [unintelligible].

880
00:56:34,233 --> 00:56:40,528
Dan: [Laughs] Okay. Thank you for listening
