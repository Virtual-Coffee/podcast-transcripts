00:00:05,953 --> 00:00:09,103
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
Season 3, Episode 3 of

2
00:00:09,103 --> 00:00:11,825
the Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

3
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:14,547
that

4
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,449
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:19,873
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:19,873 --> 00:00:21,297
their

7
00:00:21,298 --> 00:00:24,478
coding journey. And they're here,
on this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:25,918
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

9
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:27,358
it with

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,509
you. Here with me today is my
cohost, Dan.

11
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:35,347
Dan: Thanks, Bekah. Today, we're
talking with Ayu Adiati. Ayu's

12
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:37,226
originally from Indonesia and
now based in the Netherlands.

13
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:39,086
She's a

14
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:42,896
self-taught front end developer
and prolific technical blogger.

15
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:46,286
And she's on her way to break
into tech after being a stay at

16
00:00:46,286 --> 00:00:48,191
home mom for her daughter for
the past four years. We talked

17
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:50,096
with

18
00:00:50,127 --> 00:00:53,877
Ayu about the impact of
community, being a blogger while

19
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:56,786
she's learning web development
and her recent experiences with

20
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:57,237
burnout.

21
00:00:58,072 --> 00:01:00,591
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast like we start every

22
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:03,292
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

23
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:05,436
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question.

24
00:01:05,436 --> 00:01:07,580
Today's

25
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:09,756
random question is - "If you
could teleport to anywhere for

26
00:01:09,756 --> 00:01:11,931
15

27
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:18,059
minutes, where would you go?" We
hope you enjoy this episode.

28
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:24,186
Hey,

29
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:28,055
I'm Bekah. I am a front end
developer from a small town in

30
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:33,975
Ohio and I could teleport to
anywhere for 15 minutes. I

31
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:39,895
don't,

32
00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:44,156
I like, I can't decide if I want
like a nice, beautiful location

33
00:01:44,156 --> 00:01:49,085
or if I want like really good
food. I, well, I don't know. I

34
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:50,390
don't have a really good
specific place, but I would go

35
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,695
somewhere

36
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,896
that has a beautiful location
that has good food and drink. So

37
00:01:57,816 --> 00:01:58,475
my answer.

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,600
Dan: I, man, that just made
me start thinking like, okay,

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,490
well now I need to know the
rules. Can you take things with

40
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,480
you when you teleport back?

41
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:08,966
Bekah: You can do whatever you
want.

42
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:10,350
Dan: Okay.

43
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:10,825
Bekah: It's your

44
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,360
Dan: I mean, it just changed
my whole. Alright. Hi. hi,

45
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,850
I'm Dan. I am from Lakewood,
Ohio. Do front end development

46
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,280
if

47
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:23,341
I could. So I was going to say
something. Somewhere, maybe

48
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:27,360
like the top of Mount Everest or
somewhere where it's generally

49
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,920
like, not great to be, or the
it's really hard to get to, you

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,991
know, but it would be cool to
just like be there for 15

51
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:37,191
minutes, kind of see everything,
whatever. And by the time 15

52
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:40,411
minutes are up, you know,
oxygen deprivation is probably

53
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,421
setting in I'm pretty cold, so
I'm ready to go home. but

54
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:44,431
you

55
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:48,996
said food, which made me think,
okay, well, You know, can you

56
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:51,156
take things with you and in, so
maybe my answer is more like,

57
00:02:51,156 --> 00:02:53,316
you

58
00:02:53,316 --> 00:02:53,975
know, Fort Knox

59
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,411
Bekah: bank.

60
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:57,175
Dan: and also have a bank,
right. Somewhere else, you

61
00:02:57,175 --> 00:02:59,125
know,

62
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:00,115
other secret, and now I'm
thinking, oh, maybe there's

63
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:01,104
like,

64
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:05,366
like that secret room in the
library of Congress that was in,

65
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:07,030
you know, one of the
national treasure books, you

66
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,665
know, or may

67
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:10,840
national treasure movies,
somewhere to like find a bunch

68
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,985
of

69
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:17,181
secrets or something, you know,
anyway, I'm going to stick

70
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:19,912
with my original answer
officially as Mount Everest and,

71
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:21,562
we'll we can move on from
there.

72
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:26,836
Ayu: Hi, I'm Ayu and I'm front
end developer from,

73
00:03:26,836 --> 00:03:29,355
Indonesia

74
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:34,546
or originally, but, base in
Netherlands now. And if I can

75
00:03:34,637 --> 00:03:40,391
teleport myself or 15 minutes, I
would split it into two. I would

76
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:42,896
visit the, my sister in
Australia and my brother in New

77
00:03:42,896 --> 00:03:45,401
Zealand.

78
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:48,792
That would be nice because we
haven't seen each other for

79
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:50,981
almost three years now.

80
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:51,681
Dan: Oh, wow.

81
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:52,967
Bekah: Wow.

82
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:54,732
Dan: Yeah, well, that's, that's
a good answer. I live too close

83
00:03:54,732 --> 00:03:55,842
to

84
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:56,711
all of my family, so

85
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:01,606
Bekah: My brother lives down the
street a little bit, literally

86
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:03,406
have run to my parents' house
and to my other brother's house.

87
00:04:03,406 --> 00:04:05,206
So

88
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:06,352
Ayu: That's

89
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:07,127
Bekah: not that

90
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:10,391
Dan: no, it's, it's nice. I w we
do it on purpose, but you know,

91
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:13,151
it's fine. I could take 15
minutes and probably get away

92
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:13,461
from them.

93
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:18,161
Bekah: Yeah, I like the take up
splitting that's. That was good.

94
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:19,889
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. There's

95
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,384
Bekah: Welcome. We are very
happy to have you here with us

96
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:24,749
and for

97
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:27,809
everyone who is listening, just
want to say a special thank you

98
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:32,399
to Ayu because she's doing this
super late. So we can make

99
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,003
sure that the time zones,
mashed up and we could get her

100
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:35,607
on

101
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,918
here. So we are very, very happy
that this works.

102
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:40,468
Ayu: Thank you for having me.

103
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,428
Bekah: We always like to
start with everyone's origin

104
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:46,378
story, kind of how they got to
this point where they're

105
00:04:46,378 --> 00:04:48,328
learning

106
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,459
tech or in tech. So if you could
just give us your background.

107
00:04:53,978 --> 00:05:01,853
Ayu: Well, I. Have a hobby as a
photography and it was starting

108
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:07,947
from my photography hobby. And I
did the freelancer for stock

109
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:10,467
photography. And then I have my
daughter and then when she

110
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:12,987
starts

111
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:18,206
like one and half year, and it
becomes like really fun because

112
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:23,802
she start to, you know, be
aware of the camera. Yeah, it's

113
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:26,771
it's from there. And then I
thought it would be nice if I

114
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:30,672
have like a blog or something,
like to have this personal

115
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:32,892
documentation. So I was like,
browsing anything about

116
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:35,112
WordPress

117
00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:41,802
or any blogging things, but then
I bumped into frequent camp and

118
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:48,911
then I just tried it. And from
there, I just like it. Yeah.

119
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,181
There's no going back from
there. It's like, I want to know

120
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:54,281
more

121
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:58,601
and more and more. That's how I
finally got into coding.

122
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:02,069
Bekah: that. It's always so
great to hear how people

123
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:03,386
discover it,

124
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:07,557
like through other things that
they've enjoyed doing. And then

125
00:06:07,557 --> 00:06:09,282
it just kind of becomes
something that you want to do

126
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:11,007
more and more

127
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:14,966
of. So you said, you
mentioned free code camp. Is

128
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:18,627
that, how long did you stay
in free code camp or are you

129
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:21,687
still doing free code camp or,
you know, what are the resources

130
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:23,076
that you found really helpful?

131
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:26,011
Ayu: I actually not, I mean,
like for something that I

132
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,410
learned for

133
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:30,691
the first time, I'm more an
audio visual person. So I like

134
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,971
video

135
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:37,291
more. And so a friend of mine,
she was like, why don't you try

136
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,528
Udemy? So I start with Udemy
and. I like it. I mean, like

137
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:43,765
when,

138
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,622
when I see, you know, like I
see, and then I, I code along

139
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:47,427
with it

140
00:06:47,637 --> 00:06:50,614
then, it's just. But
they still use free code camp to

141
00:06:50,614 --> 00:06:53,591
get

142
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,891
the certifications. Like you
don't have to finish all the

143
00:06:56,891 --> 00:07:00,341
modules. Right. And you can just
jump into like, make all the

144
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:04,331
projects that, that are
needed and, finish,

145
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:10,161
certification. I did the first
certification, web

146
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:14,219
responsive this design, I think.
Yeah, it was it. And yeah. I

147
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:18,206
use,

148
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:21,326
more physio, from
YouTube or something like that.

149
00:07:21,326 --> 00:07:24,386
But after

150
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:26,967
I understand something, then I
can use the other resources,

151
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,547
like

152
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:32,276
a blog articles or something
like that. Yeah. But for the

153
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:34,826
first

154
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:35,817
time it's always video.

155
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:40,596
Bekah: I think that's great. And
it's always interesting to hear

156
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:43,117
the different approaches that
people take, because I know for

157
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:47,557
me, I can't watch the videos at
first. I'm the opposite. So I

158
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:52,257
need to read through it and then
I can watch the video, like what

159
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:56,007
is happening here. So it's, and
that's just another reason why

160
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:57,791
content creation in all forms
can be so great because

161
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,546
everybody

162
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:02,937
learns differently and those
different approaches, one

163
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:06,716
works for me and one works for
you and something. Different

164
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:10,166
works for somebody else. And so
it's great to be able to have

165
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:10,706
that out there.

166
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:11,961
Ayu: Yeah. True.

167
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:17,817
Bekah: So Ayu, I think that I
may have known you longer than

168
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:19,617
anybody else at Virtual Coffee,

169
00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:20,817
Ayu: Yeah, I think so, too.

170
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:25,627
Bekah: because I think I, I, I
met you shortly after I started

171
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:27,247
learning to code. I think we
were both doing, we were both in

172
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:28,867
the

173
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:33,067
group, moms can code and that's
how we met. And we were both

174
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:38,707
learning to code with kids at
home. And as we all know, that

175
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:44,143
can be a challenge. So, so
what, what was it like for, what

176
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:46,182
has it been like for you?
Because you are also,

177
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:48,221
self-taught, you're

178
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:53,712
pursuing this, not in the
confines of a bootcamp or in a

179
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:58,033
traditional school setting and
you have a kid at home too, so

180
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:00,523
there's just a lot of different
moving pieces there.

181
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:06,033
Ayu: Yeah. I start to, learn
to code when she was, my

182
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:12,457
daughter was. Two years old and,
I was self-taught and then,

183
00:09:12,758 --> 00:09:15,690
I think that I tweeted, I
tweeted one time. How to

184
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,622
juggling

185
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:25,072
between the house chores and the
kid, and also, learning. And

186
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:27,517
then I remember that one of,
who were response to my tweet

187
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:29,962
was

188
00:09:29,993 --> 00:09:33,643
you back out, so yeah. And you
said you join mom and then it's

189
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:36,222
like, oh, there's a moment.
Cool. That's nice. You know, so

190
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:38,801
yeah.

191
00:09:38,832 --> 00:09:42,002
Yeah, I joined it, but yeah,
with the time differences. I got

192
00:09:42,002 --> 00:09:45,172
more

193
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:49,712
coworking with the European
times on moms and we. Hmm,

194
00:09:49,712 --> 00:09:54,222
learning,

195
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:59,312
things that are different.
One to another, like, one is

196
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:01,292
like doing in the back end and
the other is the front end, but

197
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:03,272
I

198
00:10:03,273 --> 00:10:06,753
mean, like that's for the first
time that I felt like I'm not

199
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:08,402
alone, you know, like, I don't
care what they're doing, but

200
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:10,051
it's

201
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:14,403
like, I'm not, I'm not learning
by myself. And I, we can have

202
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:17,038
like all our, our kids. You
know, my kids were crying and

203
00:10:17,038 --> 00:10:19,673
then they

204
00:10:19,673 --> 00:10:23,153
were like, Hey, stop it there or
something like that. But yeah,

205
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:30,023
it's, it's not easy. And,
when she was two, my, the

206
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:32,715
time for me to learn was only on
her neck. And then I have to

207
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,407
wait

208
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:38,467
until the whole house is
sleeping, like around them at

209
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:43,628
night. And then I start learning
from that until 12 one in the

210
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:49,717
morning. And yeah, it's
getting easier now after she

211
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:52,312
start with her elementary
school, but it was like, hell

212
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:54,907
before.

213
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:58,875
It's like, I, I couldn't find
any perfect time to learn and.

214
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:02,602
Two

215
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:08,332
hours in total for the whole
learning. So, yeah. So I cannot

216
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:10,582
imagine that you have four,
Bekah, you still.

217
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:18,577
Bekah: You know, it was one of
those things. Where you start to

218
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:22,807
get used to being able to pivot
pretty quickly like, oh, my kids

219
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,477
are playing, I'm going to sit
down at this computer. And then

220
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,857
my mind would just like switch
on, like, it knew it has to do

221
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:28,237
it

222
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:30,683
right in this second. But, you
know, I had a lot of help from

223
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:33,128
my

224
00:11:33,128 --> 00:11:36,817
parents would watch the kids or
if I had a project to do, I

225
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:39,427
remember one weekend, my husband
was out of town speaking at a

226
00:11:39,427 --> 00:11:43,087
conference. And so they took the
kids and it was the same thing

227
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:46,097
like you were talking about.
You're just trying to. Fit in

228
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:51,168
this time. And so I stayed up so
late and then woke up the next

229
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,953
morning to try and get it done.
Cause you're trying to fit it

230
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:54,738
in.

231
00:11:54,738 --> 00:11:59,493
But at the same time, you don't
want to be formal. Bad self care

232
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:05,013
habits, because then that just
leads to frustration and not

233
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:08,462
wanting to do the thing that you
want to do. And then being mad

234
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:10,952
that you don't want to do the
thing that you know, you want to

235
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:17,283
do. Right. So it's all, it's
a whole, I don't know, thing to

236
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:21,442
juggle and it's not just about
learning. It's about. You know,

237
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:25,373
the growth and the changes that
you're facing yourself. And it's

238
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:28,852
a different role that you're
taking on and trying to figure

239
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:31,402
out how all these things work
together. And so it can be

240
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:33,952
really

241
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:37,283
great, but certainly it can be
really frustrating.

242
00:12:38,347 --> 00:12:39,832
Ayu: True. True. And especially
that I don't have my family

243
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:41,317
here.

244
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:43,522
Right. And my husband works, so
I have to do everything by

245
00:12:43,522 --> 00:12:45,727
myself.

246
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:48,822
So yeah. It's like, and people
said that, oh, you have like

247
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:50,817
lots

248
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:53,022
of time because you only stay at
home. And, oh my God, I feel

249
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,227
like

250
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:59,518
I want to cry every time I hear
that because no, if we can have

251
00:12:59,518 --> 00:13:01,903
like more than 24 hours in a
day, that wouldn't be perfect,

252
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:04,288
you

253
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:06,602
know? But we don't

254
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:08,942
Bekah: Yeah. I always say that's
like my biggest challenge.

255
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:10,562
There's not 36 hours in a day.

256
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:11,243
Ayu: Yeah.

257
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:17,857
Dan: I imagine it at least,
knowing you, I, if you had 36

258
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:19,717
hours in a day, you would find a
way to fill all of that. And

259
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:22,402
still that's still what you wish
there was more. Yeah, it's just

260
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,087
a

261
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:25,812
Bekah: accurate.

262
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:31,582
Dan: Yeah, it's that, that
switch off. I mean, we, my kids

263
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:33,152
are in daycare, you know, my
wife and I both work. But during

264
00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:34,722
the

265
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:37,903
pandemic, you know, at the
beginning, everything was

266
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:38,848
shut down. Daycare was shut
down, you know? And so we were

267
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:39,793
trying

268
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:41,427
to do that. We're trying to
juggle the kids and work and,

269
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:43,061
you

270
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:47,113
know, Emily, I would switch
off, you know, watching the kids

271
00:13:47,113 --> 00:13:52,467
and, For me, that for me, I
struggled really hard with that

272
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:53,607
context. Switching like Bekah,
you said you got, you got good

273
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:54,747
at

274
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:58,557
it. That was really very hard
for me, you know? Like, and

275
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:01,738
honestly it was less some, it
wasn't that you sitting down at

276
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:06,207
the computer part, it was the,
the going back from computer to

277
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:10,378
kids switch. That was the, that
was a struggle for me. You

278
00:14:10,378 --> 00:14:15,067
know, I, I just have so much
respect for people who are

279
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:18,847
parenting like full-time and
trying to learn or work like

280
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:21,878
through all this I, that I don't
know how you do it, but it seems

281
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:23,107
like you've been managing it.

282
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:27,057
Ayu: I don't know. I still don't
know how to do it Dan. I don't

283
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:27,177
know.

284
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,967
Bekah: it's the truth too. I
mean, people will ask, like, how

285
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:33,542
do you do it? I don't know, you
know, you just do the things

286
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:36,117
that

287
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:37,827
you, you have to do.

288
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,707
Ayu: Yeah, exactly.

289
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,422
Bekah: We talked about these
frustrations that can be that

290
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:46,241
you're facing that we're all
facing as we're learning these

291
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:47,906
things and as we're parenting
and going through a global

292
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:49,571
pandemic

293
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:54,792
together. And, and so I think.
Sometimes, really leaning into

294
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:59,981
the things that encourage us or
inspire us can be really useful.

295
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:01,991
Have there been things or people
along the way that you found

296
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:04,001
have

297
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:06,641
helped you continue the journey
or, prevented you from

298
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:09,161
giving

299
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:11,392
up and maybe some of those times
that were really hard

300
00:15:12,174 --> 00:15:17,154
Ayu: Yeah. I mean, like, I got
burned out like so many times.

301
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:23,815
Right. And, and, well, I've
been active on Twitter and that

302
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:30,065
helps, I'm doing the, A
hundred codes of challenge. And,

303
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,165
every time I sit like,
oh my God, I don't know what to

304
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,235
do.

305
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:37,475
And then some people like random
people, like, no, you can do

306
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:43,195
this. And yeah, I got, I get my
spirit back and. There are also

307
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:44,979
times, especially when you were
a self-taught. Right. And you,

308
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:46,763
you

309
00:15:46,764 --> 00:15:51,504
don't, you don't have anybody to
talk with. Like my husband, he

310
00:15:51,504 --> 00:15:55,465
doesn't know anything about web
dev, so I can not like, oh, I'm

311
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:58,884
having trouble with this code.
And he was like, what, what do

312
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:01,659
you mean? Correct. So, yeah, I
mean, I got the one time

313
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:04,434
burn

314
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:07,604
out. Like that's pretty recently
that I think. Okay. I don't

315
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:10,774
think

316
00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:12,739
that this is for me and like,
I'm going to, I'm going to just

317
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,704
quit.

318
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:18,044
And I was like, I got so, so
surprise actually with, with

319
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:21,263
that

320
00:16:21,264 --> 00:16:22,734
thoughts, because I never
thought like, yeah, I got burnt

321
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:24,204
out, but

322
00:16:24,205 --> 00:16:26,260
then like, you know,
like I'm taking break and stuff

323
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,315
and I

324
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:30,924
would be fine again, but this
time it's like different. I

325
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:35,995
already took break. I mean, like
I already procrastinated, but

326
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:41,240
still. I don't know how to get
myself together this time. Like,

327
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:44,344
I got panic attack. It was
like, I learn. And then one

328
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:46,639
time,

329
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,679
like we were having this,
theme, right? I I'm trying

330
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,719
with

331
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,500
some VC members to have this,
group project about vanilla

332
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,179
JavaScript. I mean, I got burned
out with react with learning

333
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:02,754
react before, and then I
thought, oh, this is a good

334
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:04,329
chance because

335
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:07,180
it's funny, like JavaScript. So
I can like take a step back and

336
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:13,210
then do what I know, you know,
but because so far I learned by

337
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,960
myself doing everything by
myself. When it's in a group,

338
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,019
it's a different story, right?
You have somebody else to

339
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:24,190
collaborate and everybody has
their own thoughts, like on how

340
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:28,349
to approach something, which is
not the approach that I probably

341
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,380
would take, so it's kind of made
me confused and then I got like

342
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,150
so freaked out and I was like,
What is happening, where are we

343
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,935
in? I don't know. My God, this
is funny, like JavaScript. And

344
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:39,720
I've

345
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,715
done this like so many times,
but how come I'm not following

346
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:43,710
this?

347
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,109
You know, it's like, I cannot do
it. And this feels like I want

348
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:48,508
to

349
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:52,484
stop. So I kind of pull myself a
little bit off from everybody

350
00:17:52,484 --> 00:17:56,459
for

351
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,480
like a week or so. But then I
thought like, no, I need to talk

352
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,160
to someone about this. Right. So
I start to talk to some of my

353
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,395
friends and they were all like,
okay, we are all struggling.

354
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:09,630
Like

355
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:13,980
you can do this. And then like
one of them even say to them,

356
00:18:14,954 --> 00:18:19,424
It's actually good that you, you
have that thought of quitting

357
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:22,934
because you don't understand
things because if you have that

358
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:25,755
thought, it means that, you
know, so many things, so you get

359
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:27,640
confused, you know, it's not
like you don't know anything,

360
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,525
like

361
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:35,315
yeah, you're right. I was like,
okay. And that's, you know, like

362
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:39,775
people don't want to share
they're struggling. Right. I

363
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:44,490
don't know. Maybe because.
they don't want people to think

364
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,490
they're weak or I don't know.
They, they have their own

365
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:55,259
reasons. As for me, I feel more
or less embarrassed. Like I've

366
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:59,220
been learning for so long and
then suddenly, like, I know

367
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,414
nothing, you know, and I don't,
I just don't want to share that.

368
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:05,608
If

369
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,970
I really want to do this, I want
to step forward. Then I think

370
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,610
that I should share this
struggle with at least,

371
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,250
somebody that

372
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,829
can, that I know that can hear
me out. Listen to me, you know?

373
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:19,379
And

374
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,900
it was a good decision that I
made that I just, you know,

375
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,420
share

376
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,319
here are my struggles. And then
people support me. I mean, like

377
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:29,819
if you, if you don't share,
nobody knows and you just have

378
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:31,289
to

379
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:37,184
deal it yourself. Yeah. It's,
it's been a journey.

380
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:38,579
Dan: Yeah.

381
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:42,275
Bekah: Certainly a journey. You
said some things in there that

382
00:19:42,335 --> 00:19:46,055
that really struck me. And so
you talked about this idea of

383
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:50,194
community and isolation and
sharing, and I think that, you

384
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:52,505
know, all of these things go
together and especially when

385
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:56,464
we're in those. Tough moments
where we tend to isolate from

386
00:19:56,464 --> 00:19:59,734
other people, for those reasons
that you spoke about, you know,

387
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:03,605
it's self doubt and not thinking
you can do it and being

388
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:07,325
embarrassed or afraid to share
things. And I got a piece of

389
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:10,904
advice pretty early on from
someone and they said, You

390
00:20:10,904 --> 00:20:13,904
don't share it for your show
yourself. You share for other

391
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:15,599
people because other people who
are going through the same

392
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:17,294
things

393
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:19,094
can recognize that, oh, I don't
have to do this in isolation.

394
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,893
I'm

395
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:23,595
not the only one that feels this
way. And then that's how

396
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:25,514
community is formed. And I just
always loved that idea because

397
00:20:25,514 --> 00:20:27,433
it

398
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:31,875
can be so hard to share those
things and to feel alone and to

399
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,252
feel like. I dunno, you're
you're not where you should be.

400
00:20:34,252 --> 00:20:36,629
Right.

401
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,190
Like, I it's, it happens every
week. I look at someone else and

402
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,119
I'm like, oh wow. I, I should, I
should be able to know what

403
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,529
they're talking about. And I
don't. Right. And then it's

404
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:47,939
like,

405
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,519
oh, don't fall into the
comparison trap, number one. But

406
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:52,409
number two, like embrace that
community of people that's

407
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:54,239
around

408
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,329
you. And you know, for me, I
you've been such a huge part of

409
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:59,741
my community and I don't know
how you do it, but I feel like.

410
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:02,153
There

411
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:04,464
are times when I am really,
really struggling and I won't

412
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,774
say

413
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:10,255
anything. And then I get a DM
from you checking on me and I'm

414
00:21:10,255 --> 00:21:15,684
like, oh, okay. Like I use here.
This is what I needed, you know?

415
00:21:16,585 --> 00:21:18,504
And so for me, that's been such
a, an important piece

416
00:21:18,504 --> 00:21:20,423
of,

417
00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:23,484
of all of the things that have
happened to me since I met you,

418
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:27,355
because it's nice to have that
connection. And to know that

419
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:30,924
there are people that are, are,
are willing to, to care about

420
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:31,015
you.

421
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:37,184
Ayu: And, and I learned so much
from, from, your trauma

422
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:41,375
stories, spectrum, and like,
you've been so open. Right. And,

423
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,240
and you reach so many people
with your story. And, and I

424
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,105
mean,

425
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:48,419
like, there are plenty of people
there that. Have the same

426
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,733
feeling

427
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:54,825
like how you feel, but they
cannot let it out. So I thought

428
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:56,369
like when, when I was
struggling, I thought like,

429
00:21:56,369 --> 00:21:57,913
okay, this is

430
00:21:57,914 --> 00:22:00,254
for, for me, for myself, you
know, I mean, like, and, and,

431
00:22:00,254 --> 00:22:02,594
uh,

432
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:06,464
I also think that maybe I'm not
the only one, maybe, maybe

433
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:08,414
there's also people out there
that having the struggle the

434
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:10,364
same

435
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:14,444
as I do. And if I open up, maybe
those people can open up as well

436
00:22:14,444 --> 00:22:17,444
and they, and they could like
feel a little bit relieved that,

437
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:20,835
okay. I'm not the only one. And
I, I can, I can talk about it.

438
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:25,875
Like it's, it's okay to not feel
okay. You know, so yeah. I thank

439
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:29,775
you so much because you taught
me how to do that.

440
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:33,244
Bekah: No, I'm going to cry.

441
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,710
Dan: You, you talked about
sharing, you know, your story,

442
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:44,549
especially regarding the burnout
and, you know, the we'll post on

443
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:48,299
the, on the show notes, but you
wrote a really great piece about

444
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:49,844
it. But two week, a couple
weeks ago or a week ago,

445
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:51,389
whatever

446
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:54,155
it was. And, I, I, I
just wanted to call it out

447
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:56,920
because I,

448
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,339
I love to reading it. And I
loved that. You know, you

449
00:22:58,339 --> 00:22:59,758
shared,

450
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:03,119
you shared the struggle part,
which is. I agree is very

451
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,750
important and very helpful for
people. But I, I very much

452
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,859
loved how you, a lot of the
article is more about how to

453
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:12,209
survive it, you know, how, how
to sort of recognize those

454
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:13,559
feelings

455
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,524
for what they are and then how
to sort of survive and move on.

456
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:17,489
And,

457
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,329
I just really appreciated
it. I don't I don't have I don't

458
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:22,514
really have a question or a
point, but, but I appreciated

459
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:23,699
it.

460
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,809
I mean, you know, it, and a lot
of it is just the, allowing

461
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:33,075
yourself to. Be not okay. Or
whatever, allow yourself to take

462
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:38,234
a break or step back. and I
think it's so important. it

463
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:39,015
was, it was a good.

464
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:44,065
Ayu: self care is really, really
important. I mean, like, this is

465
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:47,875
like one point in my, in my
learning journey where I really,

466
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:52,134
really want to rush things, you
know, like, I've been

467
00:23:52,134 --> 00:23:57,720
learning for. Two years, two and
half years now. And I feel like,

468
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,914
why am I so slow? So I'm trying
to, you know, speed up a bit.

469
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:03,838
But

470
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,890
I think like, because I start to
understand things, so I really

471
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:14,369
want to speed up again, speed up
again. But I didn't, I, you can

472
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:19,349
say that I ignore my. Well, I
should take a break, but I don't

473
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:24,309
because no, I want to be in this
momentum, you know, like I, I

474
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:26,809
want to keep it up, but now this
is my limit to take a break for

475
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:29,299
a

476
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:34,970
bit, but I didn't. So I think
that's where most people also

477
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:39,230
don't aware where they really
want to push and push and push

478
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:44,869
forward. They need to, you
know, like take a step back and

479
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,624
just refute the center's slowing
down a bit, then they don't

480
00:24:47,624 --> 00:24:50,338
think

481
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:52,779
about themselves, you know,
like, like, they can get

482
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:55,219
burnout or

483
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:59,414
can get frustration. So, yeah.
My experience skin, like

484
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:03,569
reminding

485
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:09,029
people as well, that the, they
need to, you know, take a step

486
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:10,470
back once in a while.

487
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:15,809
Dan: Yeah, it's hard to do or it
can be, you know, it can't be

488
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:18,809
hard to do. At least in my
personal experience.

489
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:22,559
Bekah: Well, and I think too,
when you take that step back,

490
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,799
sometimes it's hard to get
started again. Right? There's

491
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:30,269
this fear of losing momentum,
like, well, I was there and you

492
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:32,369
have to backtrack a little bit
if you take a break. And so for

493
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:34,469
a

494
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:40,529
lot of people, I think it's, I
don't know. Exactly how to

495
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:43,500
describe that feeling, whether
it's being upset with themselves

496
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,250
or having to go back or getting,
being hard on yourself and

497
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,519
thinking like, well, I should
know this stuff. Right. But it's

498
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:55,950
okay to have to backtrack. It's
okay. To start from a different

499
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,275
point that you ended up. But I
think, like you're saying,

500
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:01,119
there's just not that many
people that are talking about

501
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,963
those

502
00:26:02,964 --> 00:26:05,304
things, you know, it is okay to
take a break. It is okay to be

503
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:07,644
at

504
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:11,694
a different point than someone
else's going to be. And I don't

505
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:15,025
know this is going to sound
silly, but I always used to

506
00:26:15,025 --> 00:26:18,894
compare myself to Kent C Dodds,
which is like, not fair in any

507
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:21,535
way, shape or form. Cause he's
been doing this a long time, but

508
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:23,455
I'm like, he's got four kids.
How come he can do all this

509
00:26:23,455 --> 00:26:25,375
stuff.

510
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:30,019
Right? Like what. It's a little
bit different. He actually, he

511
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:33,650
wrote a newsletter for mother's
day, one year. I think that

512
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,490
talked about how much his wife
does to support him and their

513
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,559
kids. And it was like, oh, okay.
I get, I get this right? Like

514
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,740
there's a lot of support for the
things that he's doing and he's

515
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:50,045
been doing it a really long
time. And it's. A reasonable

516
00:26:50,045 --> 00:26:53,345
comparison. I'm not really that
reasonable, so it's not

517
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:56,404
surprising that I would do that.
But, it's not even like,

518
00:26:56,404 --> 00:26:59,463
look

519
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:03,154
at the people who are learning
alongside you. It should never,

520
00:27:03,694 --> 00:27:07,595
if that's the motivation, then
there's always going to be a

521
00:27:07,595 --> 00:27:10,865
point where you start to really
get down on yourself because

522
00:27:11,224 --> 00:27:12,979
everybody moves in different
ways and in different paces. And

523
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:14,734
you

524
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,842
know, sometimes you'll hit a
plateau. And it'll be really

525
00:27:16,842 --> 00:27:18,950
hard

526
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,154
to get back up like the
mountain. But then, but then

527
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:23,358
you'll

528
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,765
gain some momentum and then
you'll go fast again. Right. You

529
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:30,724
know, maybe your, your study all
the time, everybody learns

530
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:34,805
differently. Everybody, can
apply things in different ways

531
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:38,525
and has different strengths. And
I think we just failed to

532
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:43,025
recognize that complexity and we
try and make it this really

533
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:48,875
simple story of success. And we
forget all of the, you know,

534
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:51,964
things about being human that go
along with that story.

535
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:59,480
Ayu: Yeah, true. And I kind of
forget that. I mean, like I was

536
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,259
thinking I'm learning for two,
two and a half years and,

537
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:09,664
I'm, I'm going so slow, but I
forgot that. Most of the days, I

538
00:28:09,664 --> 00:28:12,244
only have two until three hours
a day to learn. Right. So I

539
00:28:12,244 --> 00:28:14,824
cannot

540
00:28:14,855 --> 00:28:17,419
compare myself to someone who
can spend like more than five

541
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:19,983
hours a

542
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:24,384
day to learn. So, yeah, I
need to remind myself that

543
00:28:25,035 --> 00:28:25,214
Dan: Okay.

544
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:30,529
Ayu: You're, you're going
forward. Only that you have like

545
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,410
less time than other people. So
you cannot compare yourself to

546
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:38,660
other people, but this is your
time. Right? I mean, I do,

547
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,849
the best way. I mean, like the
best that I could within two and

548
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:47,269
three hours a day, and that's
actually good, you know, like

549
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:49,924
when I got exhausted, I still
can, save some time to

550
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:52,339
learn.

551
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:57,605
So I think. I've been too
hard on myself or something like

552
00:28:57,605 --> 00:29:00,470
that and not appreciate myself.
I don't know. But yeah, I'm

553
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:03,335
trying

554
00:29:03,335 --> 00:29:07,684
to remind me myself about that.
Like You're, you're doing good.

555
00:29:07,714 --> 00:29:10,444
You're you're doing okay. You
know, so.

556
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:17,680
Dan: Yeah, I, I mean, you are,
you're doing great. I can't,

557
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,170
trying to fit that learning and,
and it's not just the hours,

558
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,474
right. Is you've talked. You
were talking about how it's like

559
00:29:21,474 --> 00:29:22,778
a

560
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:25,990
little bit during nap time and
then late at night.

561
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:26,599
Ayu: Yeah,

562
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,820
Dan: Which probably not the
best, you know, your brain's

563
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,740
probably

564
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,450
not in the best shape for
learning at that point either.

565
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,210
Right. And so that's what I mean
here. You know, you're, you're,

566
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:37,399
you're working with what you
have. And the progress

567
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:39,019
you've

568
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:41,599
made seems I don't know what to
say from where I'm sitting. It

569
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,404
seems incredible. You've
also been just a prolific

570
00:29:44,404 --> 00:29:47,209
blogger,

571
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,224
like over the last, however
long, a couple of years. And

572
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:52,758
I've

573
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,450
always been, I mean, like that.
Yeah. I don't know, I've read. I

574
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,440
think probably most of
everything you've written, but

575
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,430
like it's,

576
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:03,049
it's, very impressive. I was
wondering how you approach, like

577
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:06,920
mixing that into your normal
routine of like learning and

578
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,490
stuff like that.

579
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,630
Ayu: No blogging is, is
completely different thing. I

580
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:17,210
mean, like I really have to,
make a time to write a blog and

581
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:23,390
English is not my native, right.
So I'm not native English

582
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,374
speakers. So, I mean, I need
like three to four hours to

583
00:30:26,374 --> 00:30:29,358
arrive.

584
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,945
600 to 800 words. And you
imagine so. Yeah, mostly like

585
00:30:32,945 --> 00:30:35,660
when I do

586
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:41,960
blogging, if I have an idea,
I will do the bullet points and

587
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,960
then from there, then I will try
to, you know, like talk

588
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,960
about

589
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,109
the bullet points, little bit,
like explanation, something like

590
00:30:51,109 --> 00:30:56,854
that. It, it helps me to,
to, a little bit faster.

591
00:30:56,854 --> 00:31:02,599
And

592
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,789
if you see like my block style,
most of them always have like

593
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:06,979
the

594
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,119
bullet points.

595
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:08,964
Dan: Okay.

596
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,200
Bekah: Well, I think that's
great for readers do.

597
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:14,224
Dan: I think it's a really
effective way to, to write.

598
00:31:14,285 --> 00:31:17,375
Absolutely. That's how I,
that's how I usually write the,

599
00:31:17,494 --> 00:31:21,904
when I blog once a year. I
did the same thing, as

600
00:31:21,904 --> 00:31:23,884
opposed to once a week.
Yeah, for me it's once a year

601
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:25,864
maybe,

602
00:31:25,865 --> 00:31:30,214
but, I, I, I've just, I'm
impressed, especially on a

603
00:31:30,214 --> 00:31:32,659
limited time schedule. Like you
have, that you have both

604
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:35,104
the.

605
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:40,390
I don't know the dedication, the
willpower, you know, to, to, to

606
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,009
do the blogging because it's, I
it's optional. Right. Nobody's

607
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:45,139
making you do it, or it's not
like part of any of your, I

608
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:47,269
don't

609
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:49,579
know, certifications or anything
like that. Right. And so you're,

610
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:55,309
you're, you're just doing it
on your own and it's impressive.

611
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,559
Like blogging is one of those
things where I'm always like,

612
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:01,009
yes, this month I'm going to get
into the habit, you know? And it

613
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:02,809
never happens because it's,
nobody's making, you know, you

614
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:03,919
know, nobody's asking me to
write on my own on my own

615
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,029
website. So.

616
00:32:06,244 --> 00:32:07,654
I'm always impressed by people
who can.

617
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:12,494
Ayu: the, it's actually one of
the things that get me into

618
00:32:13,484 --> 00:32:17,505
learning to code as well,
because, besides that I want

619
00:32:17,505 --> 00:32:24,214
to, have my, photos
showcase. I also want to. Wanted

620
00:32:24,214 --> 00:32:29,255
to write about my experience,
like living, living in another

621
00:32:29,255 --> 00:32:35,855
country and with a toddler and
stuffs. But I finally didn't

622
00:32:36,634 --> 00:32:43,174
write anything until thank you
for DC for having that a monthly

623
00:32:43,174 --> 00:32:48,484
challenge of November, where we
have to write. Right. And it's

624
00:32:48,484 --> 00:32:53,525
actually, that's one of the
things that can. Hmm. How do

625
00:32:53,525 --> 00:33:00,125
you say, how do you say
that accountable? Make me

626
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:02,870
accountable. Hold me
accountable. Yeah. Yeah. It's

627
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,615
when we do

628
00:33:05,615 --> 00:33:09,934
something together, right. And
then like, yeah, everybody's

629
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:13,414
like, oh, I already wrote this
and I wrote this and I was like,

630
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:16,595
oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going
to do that. You know, like it's,

631
00:33:16,835 --> 00:33:23,105
it's fun and yeah. Even after
the, the monthly challenge, then

632
00:33:23,974 --> 00:33:28,265
I was still like in my, you
know, I was like in my mood to,

633
00:33:28,265 --> 00:33:33,224
to, to write. And that's why I
keep writing, but it's

634
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:33,970
Dan: That's awesome.

635
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,545
Ayu: all PC.

636
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,710
Dan: from VC

637
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:38,570
Bekah: As in November, we ran
our first monthly challenge and

638
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,865
that

639
00:33:40,865 --> 00:33:45,244
was, November is NaNoWriMo.
So national novel writing month.

640
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:47,869
And the goal is to write 50,000
words, which is about the size

641
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:50,074
of

642
00:33:50,075 --> 00:33:52,159
a novel. And so we said, Hey,
why don't we all work together

643
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,243
and

644
00:33:54,244 --> 00:34:00,125
try and pick, get hit 50,000
words this month writing and

645
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,234
adding to our blogs.

646
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:02,154
Dan: Like collectively,

647
00:34:02,644 --> 00:34:04,625
Bekah: Yes, not individually.

648
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:04,894
Dan: right.

649
00:34:06,664 --> 00:34:08,254
Bekah: And it turned out to
be a lot of fun. It was kind of

650
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,844
a

651
00:34:09,844 --> 00:34:15,500
last minute thing. And a lot of
people participated. A lot of

652
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,444
people were writing for the
first time and we didn't hit

653
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:19,388
50,000,

654
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,789
but I think, you know, we didn't
really gear up either. It was

655
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:24,550
like, okay, we're going to do
this. But I really think this

656
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,989
November we could hit 50,000
words and it'll be a lot of fun.

657
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:33,130
It was great to see everybody
sharing and asking for feedback

658
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:36,262
and, and getting like new and
exciting ideas out there.

659
00:34:36,262 --> 00:34:39,394
But

660
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:42,275
I also want to bring up, so
you're writing across platforms

661
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:46,264
and not only that, but you're
like recognized on all of the

662
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:48,049
platforms that you're writing
on. Like you're consistently one

663
00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:49,834
of

664
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:53,374
the top bloggers in, you
were recognized, well, why don't

665
00:34:53,374 --> 00:34:56,913
you

666
00:34:56,914 --> 00:35:00,815
talk about that first or get
ahead of myself. I'm so excited

667
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:05,780
about it. Writing on all of
these different platforms and

668
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:11,150
your choice to do that. And you
know, how, how are I want to say

669
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,579
that? I don't think you give
yourself enough credit, right?

670
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:16,730
Because everybody is giving you
credit here and saying like, I,

671
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:20,150
you is an amazing writer and all
these ways. And.

672
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,489
Ayu: No. I mean, like I w I
write, because I want to write,

673
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,634
right. It was, it was only for
the sake of the monthly

674
00:35:26,634 --> 00:35:28,779
challenge

675
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:34,300
at the beginning. And I don't
have any, you know, like a

676
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,860
website or something like that.
So I started with a platform of

677
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:48,679
hashed note where I can have my
own, address, but, I

678
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:53,719
can use their platform. And then
from there I cross posted two

679
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,999
deaths and then, and then
there's a code newbie, and then

680
00:35:55,999 --> 00:35:58,218
I

681
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:01,039
cross posit as well to go
newbie. I never think about like

682
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:03,859
gaming.

683
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:09,550
Defending readers or something
like that, because I thought, I

684
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:16,460
even thought that no one will
ever read my blog and I write, I

685
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,039
write the blog posts purely only
for myself, you know? Like I

686
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:21,618
want

687
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:24,260
to have my notes out there
because my notes are so

688
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:32,050
cluttering and, I want to,
look back to it and yeah. I

689
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,289
would write for myself that that
was the first thing. So I didn't

690
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:38,544
even know like, like when you
say back, I like, oh, how do you

691
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:40,449
do

692
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:44,619
that? I have no idea. I mean,
like, I never even thought that

693
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,449
one with read, so

694
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:50,454
Bekah: Well, everyone is
reading. And also you were one

695
00:36:50,454 --> 00:36:52,959
of the code

696
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,269
newbie spotlights in April.
Yeah. April. You were a code

697
00:36:55,269 --> 00:36:57,578
newbie.

698
00:36:57,579 --> 00:36:58,854
Spotlight. Talk a little bit
about that. Cause that's

699
00:36:58,854 --> 00:37:00,129
awesome.

700
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:03,514
Ayu: Yeah. I mean, like, it was
a nice surprise. Code

701
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:06,184
Newbie,

702
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:13,835
like sent me a DM on Twitter and
Hey, do you want to be our April

703
00:37:13,844 --> 00:37:17,405
spotlight? And I was like, oh
yeah, sure. Like, how come

704
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:17,719
Dan: Yeah.

705
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:27,139
Ayu: I have no idea? Like, it's,
it's a big surprise and yeah. So

706
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,469
that

707
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:27,659
Bekah: Yeah.

708
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,099
Ayu: was pretty much about it. I
mean, like, I, I didn't see that

709
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,150
it's coming, you know,

710
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,079
Bekah: I mean, I just love that.
I love the picture of you and

711
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:40,019
your mom in, in that spotlight.
It's just such a beautiful way

712
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:42,959
to

713
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:46,769
kind of end that there. And,
know, I don't, I don't know if

714
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:48,059
you want to say anything about
your mom, but I know that she

715
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:49,349
was

716
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:49,619
a big

717
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,374
Ayu: Yeah, Yeah, yeah, It's,
it's actually, it's actually.

718
00:37:52,374 --> 00:37:54,948
kind

719
00:37:54,949 --> 00:38:00,949
of, kind of nice story. I think
like, my mom, we were, we

720
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:04,010
were really like best friend. I
mean, like we were really close

721
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:13,130
and, she suddenly got,
diagnosed with auto-immune.

722
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:18,710
it's actually pretty much,
maintainable, if you have like a

723
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,690
good medicine, right. And one of
it is like steroids, but at that

724
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,034
time in, in, where,
where she lived, that's,

725
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:30,288
there's not

726
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:34,760
enough staff. So she got worse
and worse and worse, like really

727
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:40,340
fast. So, like one day, and
she didn't want to receive my

728
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,760
call for like a couple of weeks,
because she was like, so in so

729
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,155
bad, bad condition and she
didn't want to say anything, but

730
00:38:46,155 --> 00:38:48,550
one

731
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,364
time, like finally she received
my phone call and then. I told

732
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:57,804
her, like, we talk a lot with,
we talk almost two hours so that

733
00:38:57,804 --> 00:39:03,385
they, I told her like,
Hey, I want to, participate

734
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:05,949
in this, photography,
you know, photography challenge.

735
00:39:05,949 --> 00:39:08,513
And

736
00:39:09,144 --> 00:39:11,544
if I won, I said, then, then
I would be like, in this

737
00:39:11,544 --> 00:39:13,944
magazine

738
00:39:13,945 --> 00:39:18,659
in Germany. Yeah. And they, they
would pick up like 20, 20

739
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,525
pictures and the top winner
would be like, going into

740
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,360
the

741
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,860
magazine in Germany and just
like, oh, you should make me as

742
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,215
your model. You know? And I
think that you would win with

743
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:33,570
my, with

744
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,699
my foot on it. And I really want
to see you on the magazine. I

745
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:37,828
was

746
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:45,875
like, yeah. All right. I didn't
even get into the, the talent of

747
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:51,275
the photography. And, like
not long after that, it's like

748
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:56,135
the week or two weeks, something
like that. Then, I got a

749
00:39:56,135 --> 00:40:00,695
phone call from my arm, and
she said like, I think that he

750
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:03,380
should go. All of you are like
me and my siblings. You all

751
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,065
should

752
00:40:06,065 --> 00:40:09,664
go back because like, she's
getting worse. And we're like,

753
00:40:09,724 --> 00:40:14,824
oh, okay. So we flew, right. We
flew there. And after I was

754
00:40:14,885 --> 00:40:21,215
there, five days late, later she
passed away. So I didn't, I

755
00:40:21,215 --> 00:40:25,684
didn't get into a day magazine
of course, because I didn't, I

756
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:33,574
didn't, Participate in, in
the photography challenge and

757
00:40:33,574 --> 00:40:39,335
with this called newbie. And
suddenly now, after, after the,

758
00:40:39,335 --> 00:40:44,945
my profile got into prose
work called Nubian, then I

759
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:48,724
remember this, you know, like
this conversation, like when she

760
00:40:48,724 --> 00:40:55,610
said, I want to see you on that
magazine and this time. It's not

761
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:59,929
the magazine, but I mean, like I
want an article and that's me,

762
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:02,314
that's me there. And that's why
I took my mom picture there

763
00:41:02,314 --> 00:41:04,699
because

764
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:08,929
like, Hey, mom is like, you're
there now? You know, like it's

765
00:41:08,929 --> 00:41:12,230
not, it's not on the photography
thing that we talk about, but

766
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,440
there on, on my, on an
article about me. So yeah, I

767
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,480
hope

768
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:17,570
that.

769
00:41:21,485 --> 00:41:24,514
Bekah: It's such a beautiful
story and it's so nice to hear

770
00:41:24,514 --> 00:41:28,925
you share it and to talk about
your mom and, and, and that

771
00:41:28,925 --> 00:41:32,974
support and to see how it just
all kind of come around and, you

772
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:40,804
know, yeah. I just, just
really, really beautiful.

773
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:45,420
Ayu: Yeah. I just hope that she
proud of

774
00:41:45,534 --> 00:41:45,625
Dan: Okay.

775
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,570
Ayu: I mean, like, Yeah.

776
00:41:48,704 --> 00:41:52,349
Bekah: Okay. I mean, are you,
you're doing so much. I mean,

777
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:53,834
you're taking care of your
daughter, you're learning,

778
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:55,319
you're

779
00:41:56,969 --> 00:41:59,759
bringing up, helping so much
with the community and being

780
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:02,549
such a, a

781
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:07,530
great person to have in our
community and to, you know, have

782
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:10,710
your support and all of the
things that you share. And, you

783
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:15,269
know, you've, you've touched so
many lives. So I feel like she,

784
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:16,769
most definitely is proud of
that.

785
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:21,269
Ayu: Thank you. Thank you so
much. And I'm, I'm, I'm very,

786
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:23,279
very grateful to find,
fertile coffee, to be honest,

787
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:25,289
and

788
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:28,869
like, thank you back that Dan
and Kirk and Sara and yeah,

789
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:32,449
everybody

790
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,794
in VC, like very, very
supportive and very, very

791
00:42:34,794 --> 00:42:37,139
loving. I mean,

792
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:39,989
like this is the first time that
I feel like I'm not alone, not

793
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,269
only in the journey of learning,
but VC is more like a family to

794
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:48,374
me. And even though we haven't
met in real life, but I feel

795
00:42:48,374 --> 00:42:51,479
like

796
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,644
I'm so close to everyone as if
like, yeah, I, I I've met you

797
00:42:54,644 --> 00:42:57,419
all

798
00:42:57,539 --> 00:42:59,800
for a thousand years, so yeah.

799
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:06,219
Bekah: Yeah. I mean, that's been
my experience too. You know, I

800
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:12,730
always struggled with finding
friends and fitting in and kind

801
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,499
of understanding like my place
in things. And it's just been

802
00:43:14,499 --> 00:43:16,268
really

803
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:18,969
nice to be able to share that
with other people and for other

804
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:25,614
people too, except except me
where I'm at in that. Place and,

805
00:43:25,724 --> 00:43:28,974
and to be able to talk about
things more openly, because I

806
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:30,504
don't know if, if he knew me
five years ago, I'm a much

807
00:43:30,504 --> 00:43:32,034
different

808
00:43:32,034 --> 00:43:34,945
person than I was. And before I
never would have shared any of

809
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,795
that, I just would've like
bottled it all up, but it's nice

810
00:43:37,795 --> 00:43:39,519
to have a community that you
feel safe and supported with and

811
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:41,243
to be

812
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,914
able to talk about those things
like, wow, I'm just really,

813
00:43:43,914 --> 00:43:48,184
really having a tough day today.
You know, and, and just to even

814
00:43:48,215 --> 00:43:50,885
just somebody giving me a heart
emoji is like, sometimes that's

815
00:43:50,885 --> 00:43:52,580
all I need. I just need someone
to acknowledge that I am having

816
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,275
a

817
00:43:54,275 --> 00:44:00,155
hard day. And it's, and it's
just a really special place. I

818
00:44:00,155 --> 00:44:01,894
haven't found anything else like
that.

819
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:06,495
Ayu: True. True. I feel, I feel
the same. I mean, like when was

820
00:44:06,495 --> 00:44:09,300
I

821
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:14,565
find Virtual coffee, it was from
your tweet, right, Bekah?. Hey,

822
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:16,995
I'm having this, Virtual
coffee and, you, you

823
00:44:16,995 --> 00:44:19,425
post

824
00:44:19,425 --> 00:44:25,965
the slack, the slack link, and I
did join the slack, but I wasn't

825
00:44:25,965 --> 00:44:27,975
saying anything at all. And I
was like, I don't know. I mean,

826
00:44:27,975 --> 00:44:29,985
like

827
00:44:30,405 --> 00:44:32,874
I'm still learning. All people
here already developer, you

828
00:44:32,874 --> 00:44:35,343
know,

829
00:44:35,344 --> 00:44:38,884
and I got, how can I, I, I
didn't even dare to say hi. I

830
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:42,424
was like,

831
00:44:42,454 --> 00:44:51,215
oh my God, who am I? You know?
But yeah. So I finally, after, I

832
00:44:51,215 --> 00:44:55,534
don't know, a couple of months I
seen and finally. I say hi and

833
00:44:55,655 --> 00:44:59,764
introduce myself, in the
slack. And then I went to the

834
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:01,819
meeting for the first time when
I was like, no, everybody's like

835
00:45:01,819 --> 00:45:03,874
so

836
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:06,200
nice. And everybody's like,
maybe already have more than 10

837
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,525
years

838
00:45:08,525 --> 00:45:10,475
experience, but they're still
like so humble and so caring.

839
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:12,425
And

840
00:45:12,425 --> 00:45:17,405
I was like, yes, I think I know
that I'm in the right. In a

841
00:45:17,405 --> 00:45:20,344
heartbeat. I just know that,
yeah, this is, this is my

842
00:45:20,344 --> 00:45:23,474
community, you know? Right.
Nice. It's always nice to be in

843
00:45:23,474 --> 00:45:26,604
VC like

844
00:45:27,114 --> 00:45:31,465
you can see me almost every day
on slack. Oh, sorry for that.

845
00:45:32,144 --> 00:45:33,114
come up. Help it.

846
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,280
Dan: Oh, we are certainly glad
you are here. In slack and,

847
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:45,474
and at the meetings. It's
it's I don't know. It's always

848
00:45:45,474 --> 00:45:47,539
good to

849
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:48,050
see you there

850
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:54,925
Ayu: Oh, oh one time. Like,
I usually like do co-work at

851
00:45:54,925 --> 00:45:58,465
nights, right? Because I've
learned at night and most of the

852
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:02,909
time. I cannot really talk
because my husband and my thing,

853
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,440
my daughter's super sensitive to
voices. But the, for today I

854
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,139
already told my husband, like,
don't get bothered because I'm

855
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:13,289
going to talk loud. And yeah. So
usually in the coworking

856
00:46:13,289 --> 00:46:16,439
channel,

857
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,719
like people don't really hear my
voice because I always typing,

858
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:26,550
like people say something that
has weight, right. And then one

859
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:30,334
time Glenn. I will give ten
bucks to anybody who can make

860
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:34,118
her talk

861
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:37,329
because I never hear her voice.

862
00:46:40,894 --> 00:46:41,594
Dan: That's amazing.

863
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,065
Bekah: That is so funny.

864
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:46,269
Ayu: Yeah.

865
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:49,394
Dan: Now we can just send him
this podcast episode, Right.

866
00:46:49,704 --> 00:46:51,235
Bekah: That's right. Who gets a
10 bucks.

867
00:46:52,275 --> 00:46:53,534
Dan: Oh, yeah. Who gets it? That
we'll split it.

868
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:54,235
Bekah: Okay.

869
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:54,469
Ayu: it.

870
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:00,124
Bekah: I guess you've given a
lot of advice throughout this

871
00:47:00,124 --> 00:47:01,549
podcast

872
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,340
and through all the blogs that
you've written. So I have, I

873
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:07,639
guess, two more questions for
you. And the first would be what

874
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:10,204
has been your favorite blog post
to write if you have one and

875
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:12,769
then

876
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:17,150
the second question would be, if
you had advice to give to

877
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,690
somebody in your shoes, what
would that advice.

878
00:47:23,324 --> 00:47:26,542
Ayu: My favorite. My favorite
post so far is the last one to

879
00:47:26,542 --> 00:47:29,760
be

880
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,130
honest system, massive burnout
ones that when I, that's the

881
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:41,309
fastest one that I, that I wrote
because it's really coming,

882
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,245
coming from, like, I don't, I
don't really filter it. It's

883
00:47:43,245 --> 00:47:45,150
just

884
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:49,409
coming out and yeah, that will
one is my favorite blog posts.

885
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:55,574
And if I have. Oh, what,
what did you say again?

886
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,929
Bekah: If you had one piece of
advice to give to someone in

887
00:47:57,929 --> 00:47:59,098
your

888
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:00,449
shoes, what would it be?

889
00:48:02,864 --> 00:48:09,570
Ayu: well, if you, if you're a,
self-learner like try to. Find a

890
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,715
community because it's, it
really, really helps you. I

891
00:48:11,715 --> 00:48:13,860
mean,

892
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,935
like it's, it helps me a
lot. I get more confident

893
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:20,010
and, and

894
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:25,980
I have people to support me. And
when, when I can, I also, I also

895
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,394
can support someone. Right. And
it makes you feel like you're

896
00:48:28,394 --> 00:48:30,808
not

897
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,539
alone, but also fell you bowl or
somebody else. And if you want

898
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:36,238
to

899
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:41,005
start your own. Don't think
twice, just, just write it and

900
00:48:41,025 --> 00:48:43,334
don't think that maybe nobody
will really read it or maybe

901
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:45,643
it's

902
00:48:45,644 --> 00:48:50,594
not good. No, it is just write
it. I mean like it's, you

903
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,554
write it for yourself. That's,
that's the first thing that you

904
00:48:54,554 --> 00:48:56,294
only have to think, like write
it for yourself and then the

905
00:48:56,294 --> 00:48:58,034
rest

906
00:48:58,155 --> 00:48:58,844
will come.

907
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:03,840
Bekah: Yeah, that's so great.
