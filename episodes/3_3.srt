Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 3, Episode 3

2
00:00:09,103 --> 00:00:11,825
of the Virtual Coffee Podcast.
I'm Bekah. And this is a podcast

3
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:14,547
that

4
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,449
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:19,873
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:19,873 --> 00:00:21,297
their

7
00:00:21,298 --> 00:00:22,888
coding journey. And they're
here, on this podcast, sharing

8
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:24,478
their

9
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:25,918
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

10
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:27,358
it with

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,509
you. Here with me today is my
cohost, Dan.

12
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:34,000
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. Today,
we're talking with Ayu Adiati.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,226
Ayu's originally from Indonesia
and now based in The

14
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:39,086
Netherlands. She's a

15
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:42,896
self-taught front-end developer
and prolific technical blogger.

16
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:46,286
And she's on her way to break
into tech after being a

17
00:00:46,286 --> 00:00:48,191
stay-at-home mom for her
daughter for the past four

18
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:50,096
years. We talked with

19
00:00:50,127 --> 00:00:53,877
Ayu about the impact of
community, being a blogger while

20
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:56,786
she's learning web development,
and her recent experiences with

21
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:57,237
burnout.

22
00:00:58,072 --> 00:01:00,591
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast like we start every

23
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:03,292
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

24
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:05,436
we're from, what we do, and a
random check-in question.

25
00:01:05,436 --> 00:01:07,580
Today's

26
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:09,756
random question is, if you could
teleport to anywhere for

27
00:01:09,756 --> 00:01:11,931
15

28
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:18,059
minutes, where would you go? We
hope you enjoy this episode.

29
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,055
Hey, I'm Bekah. I am a front-end
developer from a small town in

30
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:33,975
Ohio. And if I could teleport to
anywhere for 15 minutes

31
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:40,500
[silence] I don't -- I like --

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,156
I can't decide if I want like a
nice, beautiful location

33
00:01:44,156 --> 00:01:49,085
or if I want, like, really good
food. I -- well, I don't know. I

34
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:50,390
don't have a really good
specific place, but I would go

35
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,695
somewhere

36
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,896
that has a beautiful location
that has good food and drink.

37
00:01:57,816 --> 00:01:58,475
So [chuckles], that's my answer.

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,600
Dan: I -- man, that just made me
start thinking like, "Okay,

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,490
well, now I need to know the
rules." Can you take things with

40
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,480
you when you teleport back?

41
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:08,966
Bekah: [Chuckles] You can do
whatever you want.

42
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:10,350
Dan: [Laughs] Okay.

43
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:10,825
Bekah: You're a universe [??]
[laughs].

44
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,360
Dan: I mean, that just changed
my whole -- alright. Hi. I'm --

45
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,000
hi, I'm Dan. I am from Lakewood,
Ohio, I do front-end

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,500
development. If I could --

47
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,341
so, I was going to say something
like, somewhere, maybe

48
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:27,360
like the top of Mount Everest or
somewhere where it's generally

49
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,920
like, not great to be, or the --
it's really hard to get to, you

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,991
know? But it would be cool to
just like be there for 15

51
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:37,191
minutes, kind of see everything,
whatever. And by the time the

52
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:40,411
15 minutes are up, you know,
oxygen deprivation is probably

53
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:44,431
setting in, I'm pretty cold, so
I'm ready to go home. But you

54
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:48,996
said food, which made me think,
"Okay, well, you know, can you

55
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:51,700
take things with you?" And in --
so, maybe, my answer is more

56
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,975
like ... you know, Fort Knox
[laughs].

57
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,411
Bekah: Vaults of a bank?

58
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:57,500
Dan: Yeah, vaults of a bank
[laughs]. Right.

59
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,125
Somewhere other, you know,

60
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:00,115
other secret -- and now I'm
thinking, oh, maybe there's

61
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:01,104
like-

62
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:05,366
like that secret room in the
Library of Congress that was in,

63
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:07,030
you know, one of the "National
Treasure" books, you

64
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,665
know? Or maybe

65
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:12,985
"National Treasure" movies.
Somewhere to, like, find a bunch

66
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:17,181
of secrets or something, you
know? Anyway, I'm going to stick

67
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:19,912
with my original answer,
officially, as Mount Everest.

68
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:21,562
And we'll -- we can move on from
there [laughs].

69
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:26,836
Ayu Adiati: Hi, I'm Ayu. And I'm
front-end developer from

70
00:03:26,836 --> 00:03:29,355
Indonesia,

71
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:34,546
originally, but based in
Netherlands now. And if I can

72
00:03:34,637 --> 00:03:40,000
teleport myself for 15 minutes,
I would split it into two. I

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,700
would visit-

74
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,000
Dan: Cool.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,401
Ayu: -my sister in Australia and
my brother in New Zealand.

76
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:48,792
That would be nice. Because we
haven't seen each other for ...

77
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:50,981
almost three years now?

78
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:51,681
Dan: Oh, wow.

79
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:52,426
Ayu: So, yeah.

80
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:52,967
Bekah: Wow.

81
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:55,842
Dan: Yeah. Well, that's- that's
a good answer. I live too close

82
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:56,711
to all of my family, so [laughs]
--

83
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:01,606
Bekah: Yeah. My brother lives
down the street. Literal-

84
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:04,000
literally have run to my
parents' house and to my other

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,206
brother's house. So --

86
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:06,352
Ayu: That's nice.

87
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:07,127
Bekah: Not that far.

88
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:10,391
Dan: No, it's- it's nice. I --
we- we do it on purpose. But,

89
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:12,800
you know, it's ... fine. I could
take 15 minutes and probably get

90
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,461
away from all of them [laughs].

91
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:17,900
Bekah: Yeah, I like the take up.
Splitting. That's -- that was

92
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,161
good.

93
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:19,889
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot
of- a lot of --

94
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,384
Bekah: Welcome, Ayu. We are very
happy to have you here with us.

95
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:25,000
And for everyone

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,809
who's listening, I just wanna
say a special thank you

97
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:32,399
to Ayu. Because she's doing this
super late, so we can make

98
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,607
sure that the time zones matched
up, and we could get her on

99
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,918
here. So we are very, very happy
that this works out.

100
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:40,468
Ayu: Thank you for having me.

101
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,428
Bekah: We always like to start
with everyone's origin

102
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:46,378
story, kind of how they got to
this point where they're

103
00:04:46,378 --> 00:04:48,328
learning tech

104
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,459
or in tech. So, if you could,
just give us your background.

105
00:04:53,978 --> 00:05:01,853
Ayu: Well, I have a hobby as a
photography. And it was starting

106
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:07,947
from my photography hobby. And I
did the freelancer for stock

107
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:10,467
photography. And then I have my
daughter, and then when she

108
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:12,987
started, like,

109
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:18,206
one and half year, and -- it
becomes like really fun. Because

110
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:23,802
she start to, you know, be aware
of the camera. So, yeah.

111
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:26,771
It's- it's from there. And then
I thought it would be nice if I

112
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:30,672
have like a blog or something,
like, to have this personal

113
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:32,892
documentation. So I was like,
browsing anything about

114
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:35,112
WordPress or

115
00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:41,802
any blogging things. But then, I
bumped into FreeCodeCamp and

116
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:48,911
then I just tried it. And from
there, I just like it. I mean,

117
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,181
like, there's no going back from
there. It's like, I want to know

118
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:54,281
more,

119
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:58,601
and more, and more. That's how I
finally got into coding.

120
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:02,069
Bekah: I love that. It's always
so great to hear how people

121
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:03,386
discover it,

122
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:07,557
like, through other things that
they've enjoyed doing. And then

123
00:06:07,557 --> 00:06:09,282
it just kind of becomes
something that you want to do

124
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:11,007
more and more

125
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:14,966
of. So you said -- you mentioned
FreeCodeCamp. Is

126
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:18,627
that -- how long did you stay in
FreeCodeCamp, or are you

127
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:21,687
still doing FreeCodeCamp, or,
you know, what are the resources

128
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:23,076
that you found really helpful?

129
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:26,011
Ayu: I actually not. I mean,
like, for something that I

130
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,410
learned for

131
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:30,691
the first time, I'm more an
audio-visual person. So I like

132
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,971
video more.

133
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:37,291
And -- so, a friend of mine, she
was like, "Why don't you try

134
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,528
Udemy?" So, I start with Udemy.
And I like it. I mean, like,

135
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:43,765
when-

136
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,622
when I see, you know, like, I
see and then I- I code along

137
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:47,427
with it, then

138
00:06:47,637 --> 00:06:53,591
it's just clicked. And -- but I
still use FreeCodeCamp to get

139
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,891
the certifications. Like, you
don't have to finish all the

140
00:06:56,891 --> 00:07:00,341
modules, right? And you can just
jump into, like, make all the

141
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:04,331
projects that- that are needed
and finish

142
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:10,161
certification. I did the first
certification of ... web

143
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:14,700
responsive dis- design, I think?
Yeah, it was it. And-

144
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,700
Dan: Mm-hmm.

145
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,206
Ayu: -yeah. Since then, I use

146
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:24,386
more video from YouTube or
something like that. But after

147
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:29,547
I understand something, then I
can use the other resources like

148
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:34,826
blog articles or something like
that. Yeah. But for the

149
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:35,817
first time, it's always video.

150
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:40,596
Bekah: I think that's great. And
it's always interesting to hear

151
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:43,117
the different approaches that
people take, because I know for

152
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:47,557
me, I can't watch the videos at
first. I'm the opposite. So I

153
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:51,700
need to read through it and then
I can watch the videos. I was

154
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,257
like, "What is

155
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:56,007
happening here?" So it's -- and
that's just another reason why

156
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:57,791
content creation in all forms
can be so great. Because

157
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,546
everybody

158
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:02,937
learns differently. And those
different approaches, one

159
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:06,716
works for me, and one works for
you, and something different

160
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:10,166
works for somebody else. And so
it's great to be able to have

161
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:10,706
that out there.

162
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:11,961
Ayu: Yeah. True.

163
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:17,817
Bekah: So, Ayu, I think that I
may have known you longer than

164
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:19,617
anybody else at Virtual Coffee.

165
00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:20,817
Ayu: Yeah, I think so, too
[chuckles].

166
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:25,627
Bekah: Because I think, I- I- I
met you shortly after I started

167
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:27,247
learning to code, I think. We
were both doing -- we were both

168
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:33,067
in the group Moms Can Code, and
that's how we met.

169
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:35,700
Bekah: And we were both learning
to code with kids at home. And-

170
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,000
Ayu: Yeah.

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,707
Bekah: -as we all know [Bekah
and Ayu laugh], that

172
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:40,000
can be a challenge.

173
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,300
Ayu: Yeah.

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,143
Bekah: So- so, what- what was it
like for -- what

175
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:46,182
has it been like for you?
Because you are also

176
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:48,221
self-taught. You're

177
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:53,712
pursuing this, not in the
confines of a bootcamp or in a

178
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:58,033
traditional school setting, and
you have a kid at home too. So,

179
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:00,523
there's just a lot of different
moving pieces there.

180
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:06,033
Ayu: Yeah. I start to learn to
code when she was -- my

181
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:12,457
daughter was two years old. And
-- I was self-taught, and then,

182
00:09:12,758 --> 00:09:15,690
I think that I tweeted- I
tweeted one time that -- how to

183
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,622
juggling between the-

184
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:25,072
the house chores, and- and the
kid, and also learning. And

185
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:29,500
then I remember that one of who
were response to my tweet

186
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,000
was you, Bekah. So -- and you
said, "Why don't you join Mom

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,643
Can Code?" And I was

188
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:38,000
like, "Oh, there's a Mom Can
Code. That's nice," you know?

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,801
So, yeah.

190
00:09:38,832 --> 00:09:44,700
I joined it, but yeah, with the
time differences, I got

191
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,712
more coworking with the European
time zones' moms. And we we were

192
00:09:49,712 --> 00:09:54,222
like, learning

193
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:59,312
things that are different one to
another. Like, one is

194
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:03,000
like doing the back end, and the
other is the front end. But,

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,272
I mean,

196
00:10:03,273 --> 00:10:06,753
like, that's for the first time
that I felt like I'm not

197
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:08,402
alone, you know? Like, I don't
care what they're doing, but

198
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:10,051
it's

199
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:14,403
like, I'm not- I'm not learning
by myself. And I -- we can have,

200
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:19,000
like, all our- our kids, like,
you know, my kid were crying,

201
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and the other one like,

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,153
"Hey, stop it!" There were -- or
something like that. But, yeah.

203
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:30,023
It's- it's not easy. And when
she was two, my -- the

204
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:32,715
time for me to learn was only on
her nap time. And then I have to

205
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,407
wait

206
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:38,467
until the whole house is
sleeping, like around 10 at

207
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:43,628
night. And then I start learning
from that until 12, one in the

208
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:49,717
morning. And, yeah. It's getting
easier now after she

209
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:52,312
start with her elementary
school. But it was like, hell

210
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:54,907
before [chuckles].

211
00:10:55,148 --> 00:11:00,500
It's like, I- I couldn't find
any perfect time to learn and

212
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,602
I only have like two

213
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:08,332
hours in total for the whole
learning. So, yeah. So I cannot

214
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:10,700
imagine that you have four,
Bekah, and you still pulled it

215
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,300
out [laughs].

216
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:18,577
Bekah: You know, it- it was one
of those things where you start

217
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:22,500
to get used to being able to
pivot pretty quickly. Like, "Oh,

218
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:22,807
my kids

219
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,477
are playing, I'm gonna sit down
at this computer." And then

220
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,857
my mind would just like switch
on. Like, it knew, it has to do

221
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:28,237
it

222
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:33,128
right in this second. But, you
know, I had a lot of help from

223
00:11:33,128 --> 00:11:36,600
... my parents would watch the
kids or if I had a- a project

224
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:36,817
to do -- I

225
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:39,427
remember one weekend, my husband
was out of town speaking at a

226
00:11:39,427 --> 00:11:43,087
conference. And so they took the
kids. And it- it was the same

227
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:46,097
thing like you were talking
about. You're just trying to fit

228
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:51,168
in this time. And so I stayed up
so late, and then woke up the

229
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,500
next morning to try and get it
done cuz you're trying to fit it

230
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
in. But at the

231
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,493
same time, you don't wanna be
forming, like, bad self-care

232
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:05,013
habits. Because then, that just
leads to frustration and not

233
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:08,462
wanting to do the thing that you
want to do. And then being mad

234
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:10,952
that you don't wanna do the
thing that you know you want to

235
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:15,500
do, right [chuckles]? So it's
all -- it's a whole ... I don't

236
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,283
know. Thing to

237
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:21,442
juggle and it's not just about
learning. It's about, you know,

238
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:25,373
the growth and the changes that
you're facing yourself. And it's

239
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:28,852
a different role that you're
taking on and trying to figure

240
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:31,402
out how all these things work
together. And so it- it can be

241
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:33,952
really

242
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:37,283
great, but certainly, it- it can
be really frustrating.

243
00:12:38,347 --> 00:12:39,832
Ayu: True. True. And especially
that I don't have my family

244
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:41,317
here,

245
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:45,500
right? And my husband works. So
I have to do everything by

246
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,000
myself. So, yeah.

247
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,500
It's like -- and people said
that, "Oh, you have, like,

248
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,700
lots of time because you only
stay at home." And -- oh my god.

249
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,227
I feel like

250
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:59,518
I wanna cry every time I hear
that. Because, no. If we can

251
00:12:59,518 --> 00:13:02,700
have, like, more than 24 hours
in a day, that would be ...

252
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,500
perfect, you know? But we don't
have it. So [chuckles] --

253
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:08,942
Bekah: Yeah. I always say that's
like my biggest challenge.

254
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:10,562
There's not 36 hours in a day
[chuckles].

255
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:11,243
Ayu: Yeah [laughs].

256
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:17,300
Dan: I imagine it -- at least,
Bekah, knowing you, I -- if you

257
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,857
had 36

258
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:19,717
hours in a day, you would find a
way to fill all of that, and

259
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:21,000
still [laughs]-

260
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,300
Ayu: And still not enough.

261
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,000
Dan: -and still you wish there
was more [laughs]. Yeah. It's

262
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,700
just a guess. Just a guess.

263
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:25,812
Bekah: That is accurate.

264
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:31,300
Dan: I -- yeah. It's -- that-
that switch off, I mean, we --

265
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:31,582
my kids

266
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:34,500
are in daycare, you know? My
wife and I both work. But during

267
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,903
the pandemic, you know, at- at
the beginning, everything was

268
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:38,848
shut down. Daycare was shut
down, you know? And so we were

269
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:39,793
trying

270
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:43,062
to do that. We were trying to
juggle the kids, and work, and,

271
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:46,700
you know, Emily and I would
switch off, you know, watching

272
00:13:47,113 --> 00:13:51,500
the kids. And it's -- for- for
me, that -- for me, I struggled

273
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,467
really hard with that

274
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:54,747
context, switching like, Bekah,
you said you got- you got good

275
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:57,000
at it. That was really, very
hard for me, you know? It's-

276
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,557
it's like -- and

277
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:01,738
honestly it was less some -- it
wasn't that you sitting down at

278
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:06,207
the computer part. It was the-
the going back from computer to

279
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:10,378
kids switch. That was the- that
was the struggle for me, you

280
00:14:10,378 --> 00:14:15,067
know? I- I- I just have so much
respect for- for people who are

281
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:18,000
parenting like full-time and-
and trying to learn or- or work,

282
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,878
and like, through all this. I --
that I don't know how you do it.

283
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:23,107
But it seems like you've been
managing it [chuckles].

284
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:27,057
Ayu: I don't know. I still don't
know how to do it, Dan. I still

285
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:27,177
don't know [Ayu and Dan laugh].

286
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,500
Bekah: I mean that it's the
truth, too.

287
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:29,700
Ayu: Yeah.

288
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,000
Bekah: I mean, people will ask,
like, "How do you do it?"

289
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,700
Like, "I don't know," [chuckles]
you know?

290
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,000
Ayu: No [chuckles].

291
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,827
Bekah: You just do the things
that you- you have to do.

292
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,707
Ayu: Yeah. Exactly.

293
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,422
Bekah: We talked about these
frustrations that can be — that

294
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:46,241
you're facing, that we're all
facing — as we're learning these

295
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:47,906
things, and as we're parenting,
and going through a global

296
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:49,571
pandemic

297
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:54,792
together. And- and so, I think,
sometimes, really leaning into

298
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:59,981
the things that encourage us or
inspire us can be really useful.

299
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:03,300
Have there been things or people
along the way that you found

300
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:09,000
have helped you continue the
journey or prevented you from

301
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
giving up? And maybe some of
those times that were really

302
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,392
hard?

303
00:15:12,174 --> 00:15:17,154
Ayu: Yeah. I mean, like, I got
burned out like so many times,

304
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:23,815
right? And- and -- well, I've
been active on Twitter, and that

305
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:30,065
helps. I'm doing the hundred
[days] codes of challenge. And,

306
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:34,235
every time I said like, "Oh my,
god, I don't know what to do,"

307
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:37,100
and then some people, like,
random people, like, "No, you

308
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,475
can do

309
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:43,195
this." And yeah, I got -- I get
my spirit back. And -- but there

310
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:46,300
are also times, especially when
you're a self-taught, right? And

311
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:46,763
you- you

312
00:15:46,764 --> 00:15:51,504
don't- you don't have anybody to
talk with. Like, my husband, he

313
00:15:51,504 --> 00:15:55,465
doesn't know anything about
webdev. So I can not like, "Oh,

314
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm having trouble with this
code." And he would be like,

315
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,884
"What? What are you -- what do

316
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:04,000
you mean?" Right? So, yeah. I
mean, I got the one time

317
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,700
burnout. Like, that's pretty
recently. That I think, like,

318
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,739
"Okay. I don't think that this
is for me." I'm like, I'm gonna-

319
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,704
I'm gonna just quit."

320
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:21,000
And I was like, I got so- so
surprise actually with- with

321
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,500
that thoughts. Because I never
thought like -- yeah, I got

322
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,000
burnout. But then, like, you
know, like, I'm taking break and

323
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,315
stuffs, and I

324
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:30,924
would be fine again. But this
time it's, like, different. I

325
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:35,995
already took break. I mean,
like, I already procrastinated.

326
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:40,000
But still, like, I don't know
how to get myself together this

327
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
time. Like, I got panic attack.
It was like, I learned, and then

328
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,639
one time,

329
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,700
like, we- we were having this
project team, right? I -- I'm-

330
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,719
I'm trying with

331
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,500
some VC members to have this
group project about vanilla

332
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,179
JavaScript. I mean, I got burned
out with React -- with learning

333
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:02,754
React before, and then I
thought, "Oh, this is a good

334
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:04,329
chance because

335
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:07,180
it's vanilla JavaScript. So I
can, like, take a step back and

336
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:13,210
then do what I know," you know?
But because so far I learned by

337
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,960
myself, doing everything by
myself, when it's in a group,

338
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,019
it's a different story, right?
You have somebody else to

339
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:24,190
collaborate and- and everybody
has their own thoughts, like, on

340
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:28,100
how to approach something, which
is not the approach that I

341
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,000
probably would take.

342
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,380
So it's kind of made me
confused. And then I got, like,

343
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,150
so freaked out. And I was like,
"What is happening? Where are

344
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,720
we? And, I don't know. My god,
this is vanilla JavaScript. And

345
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,000
I've done this, like, so many
times, but how come I'm not

346
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,710
following this?"

347
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,000
You know, it's like, "No, I
think I cannot do it." And it

348
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,508
just feels like I wanna

349
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:56,459
stop. So I kind of pull myself a
little bit off from everybody

350
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,000
for like a week or so. But then
I thought like, "No, I- I need

351
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,480
to talk

352
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,160
to someone about this," right?
So I start to talk to some of my

353
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,300
friends, and they were all like,
"Hey, we are all struggling."

354
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Like, "You can do this." And
then, like, one of them even say

355
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,500
to me, like, "It's actually good
that you- you have that thought

356
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,424
of quitting

357
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:22,934
because you don't understand
things. Because if you have that

358
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:25,755
thought, it means that you know
so many things, so you get

359
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:29,000
confused, you know? It's not
like you don't know anything."

360
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,700
And I was like, "Yeah, you're
right [laughs]."

361
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,315
So, I was like, "Okay." And
that's, you know, like,

362
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:39,775
people don't want to share
they're struggling, right? I- I

363
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,700
don't know. Maybe because they
think that -- they don't want

364
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,490
people to think

365
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,490
they're weak, or ... I don't
know. They- they have their own

366
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:55,259
reasons. As for me, I feel more
or less embarrassed. Like, I've

367
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:59,220
been learning for so long, and
then suddenly, like, I know

368
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,000
nothing, you know? And I don't
-- I just don't want to share

369
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,608
that. But if

370
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,970
I really want to do this, I want
to step forward. Then, I think

371
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,300
that I should share this
struggle with, at least,

372
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,250
somebody that

373
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:19,000
can -- that I know that can hear
me out, listen to me, you know?

374
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And it was a good decision that
I made. That I just, you know,

375
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,420
shared-

376
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,319
shared my struggles. And then,
people support me. I mean, like,

377
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:31,000
if you- if you don't share,
nobody knows. And you just have

378
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
to deal it yourself. So, yeah.
It's- it's been a journey

379
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,184
[laughs].

380
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:42,275
Bekah: Certainly a journey. You-
you said some things in there

381
00:19:42,335 --> 00:19:46,055
that- that really struck me. And
so you talked about this idea of

382
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:50,194
community, and isolation, and
sharing. And I think that, you

383
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:52,505
know, all of these things go
together. And especially when

384
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:56,464
we're in those tough moments
where we tend to isolate from

385
00:19:56,464 --> 00:19:59,734
other people. For those reasons
that you spoke about, you know,

386
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:03,300
it's self-doubt, and not
thinking you can do it, and

387
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,605
being

388
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:07,325
embarrassed or afraid to share
things. And I- I got a piece of

389
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:10,904
advice pretty early on from
someone. And they said, "You

390
00:20:10,904 --> 00:20:13,904
don't share it for your sha-
yourself. You share for other

391
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:16,000
people because other people who
are going through the same

392
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
things can recognize that, 'Oh,
I don't have to do this in

393
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,893
isolation. I'm

394
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:23,595
not the only one that feels this
way.' And then, that's how

395
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:27,000
community is formed." And I just
always loved that idea because

396
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,433
it-

397
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:31,875
it can be so hard to share those
things, and to feel alone, and

398
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,700
to feel like ... I dunno.
You're- you're not where you

399
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,000
should be, right? Like, I --
it's -- it happens every week.

400
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,190
I look at someone else and

401
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,300
I'm like, "Oh, wow. I-
[chuckles] I should- I should be

402
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,529
able to know what they're
talking about," and I don't,

403
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:47,939
right? And then it's like,

404
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,519
"Oh, don't fall into the
comparison trap." Number one.

405
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:53,700
But number two, like, embrace
that community of people that's

406
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,239
around

407
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,329
you. And, you know, for me, Ayu,
you've been such a huge part of

408
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:02,154
my community. And I don't know
how you do it, but I feel like

409
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:06,000
there are times when I am
really, really struggling, and I

410
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:06,774
won't say

411
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:10,255
anything, and then I get a DM
from you checking on me, and I'm

412
00:21:10,255 --> 00:21:14,000
like, "Oh, okay. Like,
[chuckles] Ayu's here. This is

413
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,684
what I needed," you know?

414
00:21:16,585 --> 00:21:20,423
And so for me, that's been such
a -- an important piece of-

415
00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:23,484
of all of the things that have
happened to me since I met you.

416
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:27,355
Because it's nice to have that
connection and to know that

417
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:30,924
there are people that are- are-
are willing to- to care about

418
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:31,015
you.

419
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:37,184
Ayu: And- and I- I learned so
much from- from your trauma

420
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:41,375
stories, Bekah. I mean, like,
you've been so open, right? And-

421
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,500
and you reach so many people
with your story. And- and I

422
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,419
mean, like, there are plenty of
people that- that have the same

423
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,733
feeling

424
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:54,825
like how you feel, but they
cannot let it out. So I thought,

425
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:56,369
like, when- when I was
struggling, I thought, like,

426
00:21:56,369 --> 00:21:57,913
"Okay, this is

427
00:21:57,914 --> 00:22:03,734
for- for me, for myself," you
know? I mean, like -- and- and

428
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:06,464
... I also think that maybe I'm
not the only one. Maybe- maybe

429
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:10,000
there's also people out there
that having the struggle the

430
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
same as I do.

431
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,444
And if I open up, maybe those
people can open up as well.

432
00:22:14,444 --> 00:22:17,444
And they- and they could, like,
feel a little bit relieved that,

433
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:20,835
"Okay. I'm not the only one. And
I- I can- I can talk about it."

434
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:25,500
Like, it's- it's okay to not
feel okay, you know? So, yeah.

435
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,000
And thank you so much because, I
mean, like, you taught me how

436
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,775
to do that.

437
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:33,244
Bekah: And now I'm gonna cry.

438
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,000
Dan: I -- you know, you- you
talked about sharing, you know,

439
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,700
your story, especially regarding
the burnout and, you know, the

440
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,549
-- we'll post on

441
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:48,299
the- on the show notes. But you
wrote a really great piece about

442
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,700
it about two week -- a couple
weeks ago, or a week ago, or

443
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,155
whatever it was. And I- I- I
just wanted to call it out

444
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:56,920
because I-

445
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,339
I love to reading it. And I
loved that, you know, you

446
00:22:58,339 --> 00:22:59,758
shared-

447
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:03,119
you shared the struggle part,
which is ... I agree is very

448
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,750
important and very helpful for
people. But I- I very much

449
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,859
loved how you -- a lo- a lot of
the article is more about how to

450
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:12,209
survive it, you know -- how- how
to sort of recognize those

451
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:13,559
feelings

452
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,700
for what they are, and then how
to sort of survive it, and move

453
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,700
on. And I just really
appreciated it. I don't- I don't

454
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,000
have [chuckles]-

455
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Ayu: Thank you so much [laughs].

456
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,700
Dan: -I don't really have a
question or a point, but- but I

457
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,000
appreciated it. I mean, you
know, it -- and- and a lot of it

458
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,809
is just the -- allowing

459
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:32,700
yourself to sort of be not okay
or whatever, allow yourself to

460
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:38,234
take a break or step back. And I
think it's so important. It

461
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:39,015
was- it was a good.

462
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,000
Ayu: Yeah. I mean, self-care is
really, really important. I

463
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,065
mean, like ... this is,

464
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:47,875
like, one point in my- in my
learning journey where I really,

465
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:52,134
really want to rush things, you
know? Like, I've been learning

466
00:23:52,134 --> 00:23:57,720
for ... two years? Two and half
years now? And I feel like,

467
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:03,500
why am I so slow? So I'm trying
to, you know, speed up a bit.

468
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:03,838
But I

469
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,890
think, like, because I start to
understand things, so I really

470
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:14,369
want to speed up again, speed up
again. But I didn't -- I -- you

471
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:18,700
can say that I ignore my limit,
where I should take a break, but

472
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,349
I don't.

473
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:24,309
Because no, I want to be in this
momentum, you know? Like, I- I

474
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:29,000
want to keep it up, but now this
is my limit to take a break for

475
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,970
a bit, but I didn't. So I think
that's where most people also

476
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:39,230
don't aware where they really
want to push, and push, and push

477
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:44,869
forward. They need to, you know,
like, take a step back and- and

478
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:49,700
just review things, and just
slowing down a bit, and -- they

479
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,338
don't think

480
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:54,000
about themselves, you know?
Like- like, they can get

481
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,000
burnout or can get frustration.
So, yeah. I hope that my

482
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,569
experience can, like, reminding

483
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:09,029
people as well that the -- they
need to, you know, take a step

484
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:10,470
back once in a while.

485
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:14,500
Dan: Yeah. And it- it's hard to
do [chuckles]. Or it can be-

486
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,000
Ayu: Yeah, true.

487
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,000
Dan: -you know, i-i-it can be
hard to do.

488
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Ayu: True. True.

489
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,809
Dan: At least in my personal
experience [chuckles].

490
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:22,559
Bekah: Well, and I think, too,
when you take that step back,

491
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,799
sometimes it's hard to get
started again, right? There's

492
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:30,269
this fear of losing momentum.
Like, well, I was there. And you

493
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:34,469
have to backtrack a little bit
if you take a break. And so for

494
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:40,529
a lot of people, I think, it's
... I don't know exactly how to

495
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:43,500
describe that feeling, whether
it's being upset with themselves

496
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,250
or having to go back or getting
-- being hard on yourself and

497
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,519
thinking like, "Well, I should
know this stuff," right? But

498
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:55,600
it's okay to have to backtrack.
It's okay to start from a

499
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:55,950
different

500
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,275
point that you ended at. But I
think, like you're saying,

501
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:01,119
there's just not that many
people that are talking about

502
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,963
those

503
00:26:02,964 --> 00:26:05,000
things, you know? It is okay to
take a break.

504
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,304
Ayu: Yeah.

505
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:07,644
Bekah: It is okay to be at

506
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:11,694
a different point than someone
else's going to be. And I don't

507
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:14,700
know. I al- [chuckles] this is
gonna sound silly, but I always

508
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,025
used to

509
00:26:15,025 --> 00:26:18,894
compare myself to Kent C. Dodds,
which is like, not fair in any

510
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:21,535
way shape or form cuz he's been
doing this a long time, but

511
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:24,700
I'm like, "He's got four kids.
How come he can do all this

512
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,000
stuff," right? [Chuckles]

513
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,019
Well, it's a little bit
different. He actually -- he

514
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:33,650
wrote a- a newsletter ... for
mother's day, one year, I think,

515
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,490
that talked about how much his
wife does to support him and

516
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,500
their kids. And it was like,
"Oh, okay. I- I get- I get

517
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,559
this," right? Like,

518
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,740
there's a lot of support for the
things that he's doing and he's

519
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:50,045
been doing it a really long
time. And it's not a reasonable

520
00:26:50,045 --> 00:26:53,345
comparison. I'm not really that
reasonable. So it's- it's not

521
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:56,404
surprising that I would do that.
But, it -- and it's not even,

522
00:26:56,404 --> 00:26:59,463
like, look

523
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:03,154
at the people who are learning
alongside you. It should never

524
00:27:03,694 --> 00:27:07,595
-- if that's the motivation,
then there's always gonna be a

525
00:27:07,595 --> 00:27:10,865
point where you start to really
get down on yourself because

526
00:27:11,224 --> 00:27:14,734
everybody moves in different
ways and in different paces. And

527
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:18,950
you know, sometimes you'll hit a
plateau. And it'll be really

528
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:23,359
hard to get back up like the
mountain. But then- but then

529
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:25,700
you'll gain some momentum. And
then you'll go fast again,

530
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,765
right? Or, you

531
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:30,724
know, maybe you're- you're study
all the time. Everybody learns

532
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:34,805
differently. Everybody can apply
things in different ways

533
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:38,525
and has different strengths. And
I think we just failed to

534
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:43,025
recognize that complexity, and
we try and make it this really

535
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:48,875
simple story of success. And we
forget all of the, you know,

536
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:51,964
things about being human that go
along with that story.

537
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:59,480
Ayu: Yeah, true. And I kind of
forget that. I mean, like, I was

538
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,259
thinking, I'm learning for two,
two and a half years, and

539
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:09,664
I'm- I'm going so slow. But I
forgot that most of the days, I

540
00:28:09,664 --> 00:28:12,244
only have two until three hours
... a day to learn, right? So I

541
00:28:12,244 --> 00:28:14,824
cannot

542
00:28:14,855 --> 00:28:17,419
compare myself to someone who
can spend like more than five

543
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:19,983
hours a

544
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:24,384
day to learn. So, yeah. I need
to remind myself that ...

545
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,800
you're- you're going forward.
Only that-

546
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,000
Bekah: Yeah.

547
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,300
Ayu: -you have, like, less time
than other people. So, you

548
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,410
cannot compare yourself to

549
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:38,660
other people, but -- this is
your time, right? I mean, I do

550
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,849
the best way -- I mean, like,
the best that I could within two

551
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:47,269
and three hours a day. And- and
that's actually good, you know?

552
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:49,924
Like, when I got exhausted, I
still can save some time to

553
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:57,000
learn. So, I- I think that I've
been too hard on myself or

554
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,605
something like

555
00:28:57,605 --> 00:29:01,000
that? And not ap- appreciate
myself [laughs]? I don't know.

556
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,335
But, yeah. I'm trying

557
00:29:03,335 --> 00:29:07,000
to remind me -- myself about
that. Like, "You're- you're

558
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,444
doing good. You're- you're doing
okay," you know? So --

559
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:16,000
Dan: Yeah. I- I mean, you are
[chuckles]. You're doing great.

560
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,339
I can't ... try-

561
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,170
trying to fit that learning and-
and it's not just the hours,

562
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,500
right? Is -- you've talked --
you were talking about how it's

563
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:22,778
like a

564
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:25,990
little bit during nap time and
then, late at night.

565
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:26,599
Ayu: Yeah.

566
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,500
Dan: Which is probably not the
best, you know? Your brain's

567
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,700
probably not in the best shape
for learning-

568
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,000
Ayu: No.

569
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,000
Dan: -at that point either,
right? And so --

570
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,300
Ayu: Yeah.

571
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,210
Dan: That's what I mean. You're
-- you know, you're- you're-

572
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:37,399
you're working with what you
have. And the progress

573
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:41,000
you've made seems ... I don't
know. Seem -- from where I'm

574
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,700
sitting, seems incredible. You
also have been just a

575
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,209
prolific blogger, for

576
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:51,700
like, over the last ... however
long it -- couple years?

577
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And I've -- that has always been
a prob- I mean, like, that you

578
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,450
... I don't know. I've read, I

579
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,000
think, probably most of
everything you've written. But

580
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,430
like, it's-

581
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:03,049
it's- very impressive. I was
wondering how you approach,

582
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:06,920
like, mixing that into your
normal routine of like learning

583
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,490
and stuff like that?

584
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,630
Ayu: No. Blogging is- is
completely different thing. I

585
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:17,210
mean, like, I really have to
make a time to write a blog. And

586
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:23,390
English is not my native, right?
So, I'm not native English

587
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:29,000
speakers. So, I mean, I need
like three to four hours to

588
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
write 600 to 800 words. Can you
imagine? So, yeah. Mostly, like,

589
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,660
when I do

590
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:41,960
blogging -- if I have an idea, I
will do the bullet points. And

591
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,960
then from there, then I will try
to, you know, like, talk about

592
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,000
the bullet plain -- points, a
little bit like explanation,

593
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:58,700
something like that. It- it
helps me to- to write a- a

594
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,000
little bit faster.

595
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,500
Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

596
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,700
Ayu: And if you see, like, my
blog's style, most of them

597
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,119
always have, like, the bullet
points [laughs]. So, yeah.

598
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:08,964
Dan: Oh, I had --

599
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,200
Bekah: Well, I think that's
great for readers too.

600
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:14,000
Dan: Yeah. I think it's a really
effective way to- to

601
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,375
write. Absolutely. That's how I-
that's how I usually write the

602
00:31:17,494 --> 00:31:21,904
-- when I blog once a year. I
did the same thing. [Laughs]

603
00:31:21,904 --> 00:31:25,300
A-as opposed to [laughs] yours.
Once a week. I s- yeah, for me,

604
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:25,864
it's once a year maybe.

605
00:31:25,865 --> 00:31:30,214
But I- I -- I've just -- I'm-
I'm impressed in, especially on

606
00:31:30,214 --> 00:31:34,500
a limited time schedule. Like,
you have -- that you have both

607
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
the -- I don't know.

608
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,390
The dedication, the willpower,
you know, to- to- to

609
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,500
do the blogging. Because it's, I
mean, it's optional, right?

610
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,000
Nobody's making you do it, or
it's not like part of any of

611
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,269
your, I don't

612
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:49,579
know, certifications or anything
like that, right? And so you're-

613
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:55,000
you're- you're just doing it on
your own. And it's impressive

614
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
that -- like, blogging is one of
those things where I'm always,

615
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
like, "Yes, this month I'm gonna
get into the habit," you know?

616
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,009
[Laughs] And it

617
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:02,809
never happens because it's --
nobody's making, you know- you

618
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:03,919
know, nobody's asking me to
write on my own- on my own

619
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,700
website. So, I'm always
impressed by-

620
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,000
Ayu: No, I mean, like-

621
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,654
Dan: -people who can --

622
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:12,000
Ayu: -the- the -- it's actually
one of the things that- that get

623
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,505
me into learning to code as
well. Because, beside that I

624
00:32:17,505 --> 00:32:24,000
want to ... have my photos
showcase, I also want to --

625
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,700
wanted to write about my
experience, like, living- living

626
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,255
in another

627
00:32:29,255 --> 00:32:35,855
country, and with a toddler, and
stuffs. But I finally didn't

628
00:32:36,634 --> 00:32:41,000
write anything [Ayu and Dan
chuckle] until, thank you VC,

629
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,174
for having that a monthly

630
00:32:43,174 --> 00:32:48,484
challenge of November, where we
have to write, right? And it's

631
00:32:48,484 --> 00:32:53,525
actually -- that's one of the
things that can ... hmm. How do

632
00:32:53,525 --> 00:33:00,125
you say? Make ... how do you say
that? Ac- accountable? Make me

633
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:01,000
accountable?

634
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,300
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

635
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:01,500
Dan: Mm-hmm.

636
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Ayu: Hold me accountable? Yeah?

637
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,000
Dan: Yeah, yeah.

638
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,615
Ayu: And, yeah. It's ... when we
do

639
00:33:05,615 --> 00:33:09,934
something together, right? And
then, like, yeah. Everybody's

640
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:13,414
like, "Oh, I already wrote this,
and I wrote this," and I was

641
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:15,000
like, "[Excited voice] Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah. I'm gonna do that!"

642
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,595
You know? [Dan laughs] Like,
it's-

643
00:33:16,835 --> 00:33:23,105
it's fun! And even after the-
the monthly challenge done,

644
00:33:23,974 --> 00:33:28,265
I was still, like, in my, you
know, I- I was, like, in my mood

645
00:33:28,265 --> 00:33:33,224
to- to- to write. And that's why
I- I keep writing.

646
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:33,970
Dan: That's awesome.

647
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,710
Ayu: But it's all started from
VC.

648
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:40,700
Bekah: As -- in November, we ran
our first monthly challenge and

649
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,500
that was -- November is
NaNoWriMo. So, National Novel

650
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,244
Writing Month.

651
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:50,074
And the goal is to write 50,000
words, which is about the size

652
00:33:50,075 --> 00:33:53,500
of a novel. And so, we said,
"Hey, why don't we all work

653
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,700
together, and try and pick --
get -- hit 50,000 words this

654
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,234
month, writing and adding to our
blogs?"

655
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:02,154
Dan: Like, collectively.

656
00:34:02,644 --> 00:34:04,625
Bekah: It- it -- yes. Not
individually [laughs].

657
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:04,894
Dan: Right [Dan and Ayu laugh].

658
00:34:06,664 --> 00:34:09,844
Bekah: And it turned out to be a
lot of fun! It was kind of

659
00:34:09,844 --> 00:34:15,500
a last minute thing. And a lot
of people participated, a lot of

660
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,700
people were writing for the
first time, and we didn't hit

661
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,300
50,000. But I think, you know,
we didn't really gear up either.

662
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,789
It was

663
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:24,300
like, Ookay, we're- we're gonna
do this." But I really think

664
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,700
this November, we could hit
50,000 words and it'll be a lot

665
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,700
of fun. It was great to see
everybody sharing, and asking

666
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,130
for feedback,

667
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:39,394
and- and getting, like, new and
exciting ideas out there. But

668
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:42,275
I also wanna bring up -- so,
you're writing across platforms.

669
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:46,264
And, not only that. But you're,
like, recognized on all of the

670
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:49,300
platforms that you're writing
on. Like, you're consistently

671
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:56,700
one of the top bloggers in ...
you were recognized -- well, why

672
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,700
don't you talk about that first?
[Chuckles] Or I get ahead of

673
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,815
myself. I'm so excited

674
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:05,780
about it. You're writing on all
of these different platforms and

675
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:11,150
your choice to do that. And you
know, how- how are -- I- I wanna

676
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,579
say that I don't think you give
yourself enough credit, right?

677
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:16,730
Because everybody is giving you
credit here and saying like,

678
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:20,100
"Ayu is an amazing writer and
all these ways!" And

679
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,150
[Bekah and Ayu chuckle] ... I
mean, you can --

680
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,489
Ayu: No. I mean, like, I w- I
write, because I want to write,

681
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,634
right? It- it was- it was only
for the sake of the monthly

682
00:35:26,634 --> 00:35:28,779
challenge —

683
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:34,300
at the beginning. And I don't
have any, you know, like a

684
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,860
website or something like that.
So I started with a platform

685
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:48,679
called Hashnode where I can have
my own ... [domain] address, but

686
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:53,719
I can use their platform. And
then from there, I crossposted

687
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:58,219
to DEV, and then- and then
there's a CodeNewbie, and then

688
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:02,500
I crosspost it as well to
CodeNewbie. I never think about,

689
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,859
like, gaining ... like,

690
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:09,550
gaining readers or something
like that. Because I thought --

691
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:14,700
I even thought that no one will-
will ever read my blog. And I

692
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,460
write- I

693
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,000
write the blog posts purely only
for myself, you know? Like, I-

694
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,260
I want to have my notes out
there because my notes are so

695
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:32,050
cluttering, And I want to look
back to it. And, yeah. Just -- I

696
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,289
write for myself. That- that-
that was the first thing. So I-

697
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:39,000
I- [laughs] I didn't even know,
like- like, when you say, Bekah,

698
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,700
like, "Oh, how do you do that?"
I have no idea. I mean, like, I

699
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,449
never even thought that anyone
would read. So --

700
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:51,700
Bekah: Well, I think, everyone
is reading. And also, you were

701
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:56,500
one of the CodeNewbie Spotlights
in ... April. Yeah. April.

702
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,000
Ayu: Yeah, April.

703
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,578
Bekah: You were a CodeNewbie
Spotlight.

704
00:36:57,578 --> 00:36:58,000
Ayu: Yeah.

705
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,129
Bekah: Talk a little bit about
that. Cuz that's awesome.

706
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,500
Ayu: Yeah. I mean, like, it- it-
it was a nice surprise. I mean,

707
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:12,000
CodeNewbie, like, sent me a- a-
a DM on Twitter, and, "Hey, do

708
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,835
you want to be our April

709
00:37:13,844 --> 00:37:17,000
Spotlight?" And I was like, "Oh,
yeah, sure!" I mean, like, "How

710
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
come?" You know? [Ayu and Dan
laugh]

711
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:25,000
I have no idea. I mean, like,
it's- it's a big surprise. And,

712
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,469
yeah. So, that-

713
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:27,659
Bekah: Well --

714
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,500
Ayu: -that was pretty much about
it. I mean, like, I- I- I didn't

715
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,150
see that it's coming, you know?

716
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,079
Bekah: I mean, I just love that.
I love the picture of you and

717
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:42,959
your mom in- in that spotlight.
It's just such a beautiful way

718
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:46,769
to kind of end that there. And,
you know, I don't- I don't know

719
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:49,000
if you wanna say anything about
your mom, but I know that she

720
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,349
was a big supporter --

721
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,500
Ayu: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's-
it's actually- it's actually

722
00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:00,949
kind of- kind of nice story, I
think. Like, my mom -- we were,

723
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:04,010
we were really like best friend.
I mean, like, we were really

724
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:13,130
close. And ... she suddenly got
diagnosed with auto-immune.

725
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:18,300
And it's actually pretty much
maintainable, if you- if you

726
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:18,710
have like a

727
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,690
good medicine, right? And one of
it is, like, steroids. But at

728
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:29,700
that time, in- in where- where
she lived, the -- that's --

729
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,288
there's not enough steroids.

730
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:35,000
So she got worse, and worse, and
worse, like, really fast.

731
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,340
So, like, one day -- and- and
she didn't want to receive

732
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,760
call for like a couple of weeks.
Because she was like so -- in so

733
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,000
bad- bad condition. And she
didn't want to say anything.

734
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,550
But one

735
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,364
time, like, finally she received
my phone call, and then, I told

736
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:57,804
her, like -- we talked a lot.
We- we talked almost two hours

737
00:38:57,804 --> 00:39:03,385
at that day. And I told her,
like, "Hey, I want to

738
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:08,000
participate in this photography,
you know, photography challenge.

739
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And if I won," I said, "Then-
then I would be, like, in this

740
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,700
magazine in Germany," I said.
And, "They- they would pick up,

741
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,000
like, twenty- twenty pictures.
And- and- and the top winner

742
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
would be, like, going into the
magazine in Germany."

743
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,860
And she was like, "Oh, you
should make me as

744
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,215
your model," you know? "And- and
I think that you would win with

745
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:33,570
my- with

746
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,285
my photo on it. And I really
want to see you on the

747
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:37,000
magazine." And

748
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I was like, "Yeah, right
[chuckles]." And then, like, I

749
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,875
didn't even get into the- the-
the challenge of

750
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:51,275
the photography. And, like, not
long after that, it's like

751
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:56,135
a week or two weeks, something
like that. Then, I got a

752
00:39:56,135 --> 00:40:00,695
phone call from my aunt. And she
said, like, "I think that

753
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:06,000
you should go back. All of you."
Like, me and my siblings. "You

754
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,500
all should

755
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,664
go back because, like, she's
getting worse." And we were,

756
00:40:09,724 --> 00:40:14,000
like, "Oh, okay." So we flew,
right? We flew there. And after

757
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,700
I was there, five days late --
later, she passed away. So I

758
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,215
didn't- I

759
00:40:21,215 --> 00:40:25,684
didn't get into a the magazine,
of course, because I didn't- I

760
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:33,574
didn't ... participate in- in
the photography challenge. And

761
00:40:33,574 --> 00:40:39,335
with this CodeNewbie, and
suddenly -- no. After- after the

762
00:40:39,335 --> 00:40:44,945
-- my profile got into prod-
CodeNewbie, and then I

763
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:48,724
remember this, you know, like,
this conversation. Like, when

764
00:40:48,724 --> 00:40:54,000
she said, "I want to see you on
that magazine." And this time,

765
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
like, it's not the magazine,

766
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,929
but I- I mean, like, I'm on an
article. And that's me.

767
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:04,000
That's me there. And that's why
I took my mom picture there.

768
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,800
Because like, "Hey, mom," it's
like, "You're there now," you

769
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,929
know? Like, "It's

770
00:41:08,929 --> 00:41:12,230
not, it's not on the photography
thing that we talk about, but

771
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,000
you're there on- on my -- on an
article about me." So, yeah. I

772
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,485
hope that ... she liked it.

773
00:41:21,485 --> 00:41:24,514
Bekah: It's such a beautiful
story. And it's so nice to hear

774
00:41:24,514 --> 00:41:28,925
you share it and to talk about
your mom. And- and- and that

775
00:41:28,925 --> 00:41:32,974
support and to see how it just
all kind of come arounds, and,

776
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:40,500
you know ... yeah. I just- I
just -- really, really

777
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:40,804
beautiful.

778
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:45,719
Ayu: Yeah. I- I just hope that
she proud of me.

779
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,570
I mean, like ... yeah
[chuckles].

780
00:41:48,704 --> 00:41:52,349
Bekah: I mean, Ayu, you're doing
so much. I mean,

781
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:53,834
you're taking care of your
daughter, you're learning,

782
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:55,319
you're ...

783
00:41:56,969 --> 00:41:59,759
bringing up -- helping so much
with the community, and being

784
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:02,549
such a- a

785
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:07,530
great person to have in our
community. And to, you know,

786
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:10,710
have your support, and all of
the things that you share, and,

787
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:15,269
you know, you've- you've touched
so many lives. So I- I feel like

788
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:16,769
she, most definitely, is proud
of you.

789
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:21,269
Ayu: Thank you. Thank you so
much. And I'm- I'm- I'm very,

790
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:25,289
very grateful to find Virtual
Coffee, to be honest. I mean,

791
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:32,449
like, thank you Bekah, Dan, and
Kirk, and Sara, and, yeah.

792
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,794
Everybody in VC, like, very,
very supportive and very, very

793
00:42:34,794 --> 00:42:37,139
loving. I mean, like,

794
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:39,989
this is the first time that I
feel like I'm not alone, not

795
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,269
only in the journey of learning,
but VC is more like a family to

796
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:48,374
me. And even though we haven't
met in real life, but I feel

797
00:42:48,374 --> 00:42:51,479
like

798
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm so close to everyone as if
like, yeah, I- I've- I've meet

799
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,800
you all for a thousand years.
So, yeah [Dan chuckles].

800
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:06,219
Bekah: Yeah. I mean, that's been
my experience too, you know? I

801
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:12,730
always struggled with finding
friends, and fitting in, and

802
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:15,500
kind of understanding like my
place in things. And it's just

803
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,268
been really

804
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:18,969
nice to be able to share that
with other people, and for other

805
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:25,614
people to except -- accept me
where I'm at in that place, and-

806
00:43:25,724 --> 00:43:28,974
and to be able to talk about
things more openly. Because I

807
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:30,504
don't know if- if you knew me
five years ago, I'm a- a much

808
00:43:30,504 --> 00:43:32,034
different

809
00:43:32,034 --> 00:43:34,945
person than I was. And before, I
never would have shared any of

810
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,795
that. I just would've, like,
bottled it all up. But it's nice

811
00:43:37,795 --> 00:43:39,519
to have a community that you
feel safe and supported with and

812
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:41,243
to be

813
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,914
able to talk about those things
like, "Wow, I'm just really,

814
00:43:43,914 --> 00:43:47,300
really having a tough day
today," you know? And- and just

815
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,184
to -- even

816
00:43:48,215 --> 00:43:50,885
just somebody giving me a heart
emoji is like, sometimes that's

817
00:43:50,885 --> 00:43:54,275
all I need. I just need someone
to acknowledge that I am having

818
00:43:54,275 --> 00:44:00,155
a hard day. And it's- and it's
just a really special place. I

819
00:44:00,155 --> 00:44:01,894
haven't found anything else like
that.

820
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:09,329
Ayu: True. True. I feel- I feel
the same. I mean, like, when was

821
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:14,565
I find Virtual Coffee? It was
from your tweet, right, Bekah?

822
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:17,300
And I was, like, "Hey, I'm
having this virtual coffee."

823
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,425
And, you- you post

824
00:44:19,425 --> 00:44:25,965
the Slack- the Slack link, and I
did join the Slack. But I wasn't

825
00:44:25,965 --> 00:44:29,500
saying anything at all. And I
was like, "I don't know. I mean,

826
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,000
like, I'm still learning. And
all people here are already

827
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
developer," you know? And, like,
I -- how can I s- I- I didn't

828
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
even dare to say hi. Hmm. I was,
like, "Oh, my god. Who am I?"

829
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:51,300
You know? [Laughs] But, yeah. So
I, finally, after -- I don't

830
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,534
know. A couple of months, I
think. And finally, I say hi and

831
00:44:55,655 --> 00:44:59,764
introduce myself in the Slack.
And then I went to the

832
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:03,500
meeting for the first time. And
I was like, "No, everybody's,

833
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,700
like, so nice." And- and
everybody's, like, maybe already

834
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,525
have more than 10 years

835
00:45:08,525 --> 00:45:12,425
experience, but they're still,
like, so humble and so caring.

836
00:45:12,425 --> 00:45:16,000
And I was like, "Yes. I think I
know that I'm in the right

837
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,405
place." In a

838
00:45:17,405 --> 00:45:20,344
heartbeat, I just knew that,
"Yeah. This is- this is my

839
00:45:20,344 --> 00:45:25,000
community," you know? Like,
it's- it's nice. It's always

840
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,604
nice to be in VC. I mean, like,

841
00:45:27,114 --> 00:45:31,000
you can see me almost every day
on Slack. Oh, I'm so sorry for

842
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,114
that. But I just cannot help it
[laughs].

843
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,280
Dan: Oh, we're certainly glad
that you are here in Slack and-

844
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:47,000
and- and at the meetings. It's-
it's -- I don't know. It's

845
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,050
always good to see you there.

846
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:54,925
Ayu: Oh, oh, oh, one time. Like,
I usually, like, do co-work at

847
00:45:54,925 --> 00:45:58,465
nights, right? Because I learn
at nights. And most of the

848
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:02,909
time, I- I cannot really talk
because my husband and my-

849
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,440
my daughter's super sensitive to
voices. But the -- for today, I

850
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,139
already told my husband, like,
"Don't get bothered because I'm

851
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:15,000
gonna talk loud." [All chuchkle]
And, yeah. So usually, in the

852
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
coworking channel, like,

853
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,719
people don't really hear my
voice because I always typing,

854
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:25,700
like, people say something, and
I always, "Wait! I type," right?

855
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,700
[Ayu and Dan laugh] And then,
one time, Glen, he was like, "I

856
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,700
will give ten bucks to anybody
who can [laughs]- who can make

857
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,329
her talk [Ayu and Dan laugh].
Because I never hear her voice."

858
00:46:40,894 --> 00:46:41,594
Dan: That's amazing [laughs].

859
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,065
Bekah: That is so funny.

860
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:46,269
Ayu: Yeah.

861
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:49,394
Dan: Well, now we can just send
him this podcast episode, right?

862
00:46:49,704 --> 00:46:49,705
Bekah: That's right.

863
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,500
Ayu: Yeah, right?

864
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,000
Bekah: Who gets the ten bucks?

865
00:46:52,275 --> 00:46:53,534
Dan: Oh, yeah. Who gets it?
We'll split it.

866
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,469
Ayu: Split it [Ayu and Dan
chuckle].

867
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:00,124
Bekah: I guess you've given a
lot of advice throughout this

868
00:47:00,124 --> 00:47:01,549
podcast

869
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,340
and through all the blogs that
you've written. So I have -- I

870
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:07,639
guess, two more questions for
you. And the first would be what

871
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:10,204
has been your favorite blog post
to write, if you have one? And

872
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:12,769
then,

873
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:17,150
the second question would be, if
you had advice to give to

874
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,690
somebody in your shoes, what
would that advice be?

875
00:47:23,324 --> 00:47:29,500
Ayu: My favorite- my favorite
post so far is the last one to

876
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:34,500
be honest. It's the massive
burnout ones. That -- when I --

877
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:40,700
that's the fastest one that I-
that I wrote because it's really

878
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:44,700
coming- coming from -- like, I
don't- I don't really filter it.

879
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,150
It's just

880
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:49,409
coming out. And, yeah. That one
is my favorite blog posts.

881
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:55,574
And if I have ... oh, what- what
did you say again?

882
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,700
Bekah: If you had one piece of
advice to give to someone in

883
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,449
your shoes, what would it be?

884
00:48:02,864 --> 00:48:09,570
Ayu: Well, if you- if you're a
self-learner, like, try to find

885
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,715
a community. Because it's -- it
really, really helps you. I

886
00:48:11,715 --> 00:48:13,860
mean,

887
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,935
like, it's -- it helps me a lot.
I get more confident

888
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:20,010
and- and

889
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:25,980
I have people to support me. And
when- when I can, I also- I also

890
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:30,700
can support someone, right? And
it makes you feel like you're

891
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:36,000
not alone, but also valuable for
somebody else. And if you want

892
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,005
to start your blog, don't think
twice. Just- just write it,

893
00:48:41,025 --> 00:48:43,334
and- and- and don't think that
maybe nobody will- will read it

894
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:45,643
or maybe it's

895
00:48:45,644 --> 00:48:50,594
not good. No, it -- just- just
write it. I mean, like, it's --

896
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,000
you write it for yourself.
That's- that's the first thing

897
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,700
that you only have to think.
Like, write it for yourself,

898
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,844
and then the rest will come.

899
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:03,840
Bekah: Yeah, that's so great.
Well, Ayu, thank you so much for

900
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,500
