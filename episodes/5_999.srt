00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:07,370
Dan Ott: Hello, and welcome to a
special Kirk Day Bonus Episode

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,559
of

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,528
the Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Dan. And this is a podcast that

4
00:00:15,528 --> 00:00:18,559
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,028
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:21,497
their coding

7
00:00:21,498 --> 00:00:25,368
journey. And they're here on
this podcast, usually, sharing

8
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:28,189
their stories and what they've
learned. Today, we had a little

9
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:31,428
bit of a different time. Bekah
actually came up to Cleveland

10
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:35,959
â€” where I work. And we
actually met in person for the

11
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:38,929
first time ever after knowing
each other for over three years.

12
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:42,859
And it was fun. And today is
also a Kirk Day which you will

13
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:47,058
hear about a little bit later in
the episode. And also, Kirk

14
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:50,959
joined us as well, and it was
really fun. And it was a fun

15
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:52,008
little thing. We streamed it
live, we had some people sharing

16
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,057
in the

17
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:54,618
comments, and we thought we
would share it on the podcast

18
00:00:54,618 --> 00:00:56,148
stream as

19
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:00,649
well. So enjoy, and next week
we will get back to our regular

20
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:10,000
schedule. Hey, we were muted the
whole time [Bekah laughs].

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Bekah, why did you do it?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I was on my
phone [laughs].

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,316
Dan: I was just thinking in my
head, "Oh, I hope the sound

22
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:17,866
sounds good." And then, I- I

23
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:20,537
was like, "Huh?" I looked at the
mute thing and --

24
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:23,000
Bekah: Just so everybody knows,
I just did-

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,200
Dan: You did a great job.

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,700
Bekah: -the most amazing-

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,700
Dan: It was awesome.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Bekah: -intro that I've ever
done.

28
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,500
Dan: Yep.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Bekah: It's- it's suck
[chuckles].

27
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,300
Dan: It's really good. Yep.

28
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,000
Bekah: So here's my not so great
intro.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,300
Dan: We do.

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,156
Bekah: We are coming here, live

29
00:01:34,156 --> 00:01:37,816
from Lakewood, Ohio. We are
celebrating national Kirk day or

30
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:40,757
international Kirk day as we
more fondly know it at Virtual

31
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:41,236
Coffee.

32
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:42,337
Dan: Intergalactic Kirk day?

33
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:47,147
Bekah: Intra galactic? Inter- I
was gonna say disciplinary. That

34
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:49,500
is not the right word.
Dimensional -- interdimensional

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,057
Kirk day.

36
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:50,656
Dan: Yeah.

35
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:53,027
Bekah: Because it is preserved
everywhere, because perk is

36
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:56,266
awesome and amazing, and we like
to celebrate Kirk as much as we

37
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:57,000
can.

38
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,000
Dan: Agreed.

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,186
Bekah: Dan, would you like to
introduce what international

38
00:02:01,277 --> 00:02:03,917
dimensional disciplinary Kirk
day is?

39
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:08,000
Dan: So, was it just a year
ago-

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,500
Bekah: It was a year ago, today.

41
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,727
Dan: two years ago? Today? Yes,

40
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:16,500
Kirk had a tweet where he showed
-- how should I read the --

41
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,800
Bekah: You should. And put in
the announcement.

42
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,501
Dan: I feel like I should have
read the- the right text.

00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:21,300
Bekah: Post it in the chat too. 

42
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,521
Dan: The- the- the -- this is
it, right?

43
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:24,700
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

44
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,500
Dan: Yeah. So, Kirk tweeted,
"Today we have achieved the

45
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,412
dream. My -- I

44
00:02:30,412 --> 00:02:32,801
made a function called Missy
Elliott that takes data

45
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:37,572
structure, flips it and reverses
it. I have ascended." And then,

46
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:42,000
very shortly after that,
Missy Elliott responded

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,700
[chuckles], replied on Twitter.
Actual Missy Elliott. Not- not a

48
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,000
fake Missy Elliott.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Bekah: The Missy Elliott. That's
--

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,592
Dan: And- and said something
like, yeah, she said, "Wow, I'm

49
00:02:50,592 --> 00:02:53,366
humbly -- I'm so humbly
grateful. Much love to y'all."

50
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:56,140
And that

51
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:59,981
was the beginning of a legend.
It was- it was really, really

52
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:03,700
awesome [laughs]. And everybody
saw it, and perks, you know,

53
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:03,822
Twitter ...

53
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:10,000
well, let's see what the -- it-
it- it Kirk's tweet got a one

54
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,700
-- 13,3 thousand retweets
[laughs] and a hundred --

55
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,700
Bekah: A hundred and 70
[chuckles] -- 70 thousand like.

56
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,282
Dan: Yeah. And it's really
good stuff.

56
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:21,117
Bekah: It -- but not only that,
not only was it just YouTube,

57
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:26,300
but it expanded. So this was not
a one day event. It was-

58
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:26,700
Dan: Yeah.

59
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,000
Bekah: -it was on Twitter,

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
it was on LinkedIn, it was on
Reddit. Everybody loves Kirk.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,151
Dan: Yes. And we all are --
already loved Kirk. And this is

61
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:40,122
just a sort of celebration of-
of the rest of the world,

62
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:40,500
right?

63
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:40,700
Bekah: Yeah.

64
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,000
Dan: Be-becoming aware of- of
the Kirk.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,822
Bekah: So maybe we should tell
our Kirk's origin story.

65
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:51,000
Dan: I think that's a great
idea [laughs]. Do you want me to

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
go first? Do you want to go
first?

67
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,300
Bekah: You go first.

68
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,122
Dan: Alright. I don't -- I mean,
I, like -- I don't have a

68
00:03:55,122 --> 00:03:56,967
specific -- I don't remember
the, like, moment right? Of- of

69
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:58,812
meeting

70
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:03,056
Kirk. Cuz that was back in the
time of Virtual Coffee being --

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,500
Bekah: A tiny baby.

71
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,097
Dan: Yes. Very s- a little
smaller, you know? And so, we

72
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:15,700
had Slack, we had the coffees,
obviously. But -- and I'm not

74
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,000
a person who ... I don't know. I
don't know a lot of people

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,786
[laughs]. I don't really

76
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:23,307
-- like, people don't stick in
my brain until- until we, like,

77
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:27,357
interact. You know what I mean?
And so, my thing with Kirk was-

78
00:04:27,387 --> 00:04:29,786
was really the Hacktoberfest.
Was really, like, leading up

79
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:32,431
to Hacktoberfest that year. So
it was two years ago. And ...

80
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:35,076
Bekah

81
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:38,997
and I, you know, we worked
together and I had known Sarah

82
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:42,700
because she was, you know, like,
she was already, like, helping

84
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,201
with Virtual Coffee and all that
stuff. And I could just

85
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,700
kinda wrote me in for
Hacktoberfest to, like, help.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,300
Bekah: You -- okay.

87
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,000
Dan: And I was excited.

88
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,450
Bekah:  To be fair, you were
like, "If you

88
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:54,641
need help with anything, let me
know."

89
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:56,000
Dan: I may have said that.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Bekah: So, if you offer to help,
you will [chuckles].

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,500
Dan:  It's true. Yes, most
people find that about -- out

93
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,700
about that eventually. But,
yeah. So, Kirk was there too,

94
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
right? And I have, like --

95
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,541
I, like -- you- you know,
I'd heard his name or whatever.

96
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,700
I, you know, we had been --

97
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Bekah: But he wasn't Kirk at
that point.

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Dan: He was still TK.

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,800
Bekah: He was still TK.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,091
Dan: That's right. He was

97
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:21,132
just the mysterious TK, which
made me, you know, want to know

98
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:24,132
him more, you know? Because,
anyway, that has a mysterious

99
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:25,000
name, you know? You need to-

100
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,500
Bekah: Mm-hmm. Yeah. You need to
know-

101
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,000
Dan: -know more --

102
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,000
Bekah: -more of the story.

100
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:29,831
Dan: And, yeah. And then that
-- so that -- it was like that

101
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,569
September leading up to
that October, it was a lot of

102
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:35,307
Kirk and I were

103
00:05:35,307 --> 00:05:37,976
-- I mean, I was working on
the site and that's when the

104
00:05:37,976 --> 00:05:39,206
first like this -- the current
version of the site happened,

105
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,436
you

106
00:05:40,437 --> 00:05:41,772
know? We made the leap with like
-- that which has brought us the

107
00:05:41,772 --> 00:05:43,107
site

108
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:45,357
for Virtual Coffee where we're
doing all that stuff. And so, I

109
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:49,700
would be up in the middle of the
night [chuckles]. And Kirk was

110
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,000
usual- usually there too. And we
would like talk, and, you know,

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,700
throw ideas back

112
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,700
and forth, and think about
things. And then he was doing a

113
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,000
lot of the work on the ... I
dunno. More --

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,700
Bekah: Documentation part.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Dan: Yeah, social aspect of it,
the documentation, you know,

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,497
thinking about how, like, people
are going

117
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,976
to interact with Virtual Coffee,
and like how we need

118
00:06:08,307 --> 00:06:11,156
resources for maintainers, and
what those could look like, and

119
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:12,896
things like that. And so I
gained a lot of like -- both, it

120
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:14,636
was like fun to

121
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,947
hang out with them. And again,
a lot of, like, respect for

122
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:21,086
him, you know, at the same time.
So- so, yeah. And then after

123
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:23,906
that, it was just like, we're
just talking every day and had

124
00:06:24,237 --> 00:06:25,000
been doing that for-

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,300
Bekah: Ever?

126
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,526
Dan: -the last ... million
years? I don't -- it feels

125
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:29,500
like -- I don't- I don't know.

126
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Bekah: In all dimension?

127
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,226
Dan: You know, in- in

126
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:35,000
multiple dimensions. I'd say,
if we're gonna use MCU, you

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,500
know, terminology though, Kirk
would be like a Nexus being,

128
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,700
right? So, there's only like,
one Kirk-

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,300
Bekah: Yes.

130
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Dan: -across the dimensions.
This --

131
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,000
Bekah: Yes.

130
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Dan: He's -- our Kirk [??]-

131
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:46,700
Bekah: Our Kirk [??].

131
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,500
Dan: -our Kirk [??] is prime
Kirk in there --

132
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:47,700
Bekah: All the Kirks.

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,700
Dan: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,300
Bekah: Yeah.

132
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,000
Dan: That's what I mean.
Yeah.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,300
Bekah: For sure.

134
00:06:50,300 --. 00:06:50,500
Dan: Yeah.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,076
Bekah: He's the right Kirk.

134
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,146
Dan: Exactly [laughs].

135
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,992
Bekah: I will tell my Kirk
origin story. I don't remember

136
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:01,557
it

137
00:07:01,557 --> 00:07:05,637
exactly, but I have known Kirk
longer than most of the people

138
00:07:05,637 --> 00:07:08,500
I've known at Virtual Coffee.
But back when I knew Kirk, he

140
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,500
was like a -- maybe a python
image or a snake icon?

141
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,000
Dan: Oh, yeah, yeah.

142
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:14,700
Bekah: He was not-

143
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,000
Dan: Yeah. He --

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,991
Bekah: -I didn't know his face.
And then he started coming to

142
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,836
Virtual Coffee,

143
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:25,646
and I am really ... like,
nervous when I meet new people.

144
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:30,000
And then, I was like, "I think
this person knows me?" And I had

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,716
to try and figure

146
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,206
it out [laughs]. And he would
sit in this office, like, with a

147
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:38,966
flag behind him, and everybody's
wearing masks back then when you

148
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:43,317
were on Zoom. And so I'm like,
"Who is this person that is

149
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:47,127
coming? I'm very nervous about
them." And then Kirk kept

150
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:50,000
showing up. I'm like, "Okay.
This is like, this- this person

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,500
might be my friend. I think
maybe we're moving into

152
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,566
friendship right now.

153
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:57,131
And then, when we were moving
into Hacktoberfest, I was

154
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:59,275
like, "Hmm."

155
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:04,700
I don't know who suggested it.
Somehow, Kirk ended up on the

157
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,766
Hacktoberfest team. And it was
me, Dan, Sarah, Brian, and Kirk.

158
00:08:11,276 --> 00:08:15,000
And I feel like me, Sarah, Dan,
and Brian were like,

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,500
"[in fast speed] Talk, talk,
talk."

160
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,187
And Kirk was like, "Why don't we
think about this for a second?"

161
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:26,000
[All laugh] Like, "Yes, we
shall -- probably should."

162
00:08:26,000 --. 00:08:27,000
Dan: Notorious [??].

163
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,156
Bekah: So, Kirk was always

162
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:34,466
doing a great job of roping
us all back to having productive

163
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:36,131
conversations and making
progress on all the things that

164
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:37,796
we were

165
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:39,566
really excited about doing, and
making sure that they happen.

167
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:45,500
And -- like, for me, I like --
had not really ever I've heard

168
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,486
about documentation,

169
00:08:46,486 --> 00:08:49,697
like, talk about documentation
[laughs]. Put like, "What is

170
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:52,456
that thing?" And then, like,
Kirk was like, breaking it down.

171
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:54,826
This is why documentation is
important. And then, you know,

172
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:58,037
Kirk has a teaching background
too. And so it was like, "Okay,

173
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,256
this is starting to click a
little bit more for me." And to,

174
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:04,366
like, show how you can help more
people through the documentation

175
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:08,836
became something that was
like a change in my life, you

176
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:11,700
know, I will make no big deal,
but [laughs] --

177
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,300
Dan: No biggie.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,246
Bekah: That's all. So, all
right. I'm

178
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:19,067
gonna check out the chat now.
That's my- my Kirk origin story,

179
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:22,336
and this is how he's become to
be my best friend ever since.

---

180
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:27,047
Dan: Yeah. So we just
got a comment from David saying,

181
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:28,876
so cool to see you in the same
place, physical physically, yet.

182
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:31,216
This is the first time that we
have like actually met in real

183
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:34,226
life. And we started working
with. When did we start

184
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:36,567
Bekah: working together? July?
This will be, so it would,

185
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:37,496
would've been three years

186
00:09:37,496 --> 00:09:40,437
Dan: in July before Virtual
Coffee. Like we were working

187
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:41,726
together before it started

188
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:44,746
Bekah: Dan fired me. And that's
how Virtual Coffee started

189
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:45,891
Dan: As soon as I said that, I
knew you were going to say that

190
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:47,036
I

191
00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:47,486
did not

192
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:52,346
Bekah: fire. My kids got sent
home from school and then I came

193
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:54,716
home and Dan was like, sorry,
you're fired. Good luck.

194
00:09:58,736 --> 00:10:01,248
Dan: I mean, sometimes you have
to fire. I didn't fire you.

195
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:03,760
Okay.

196
00:10:03,761 --> 00:10:07,201
You were a contractor, so I just
stopped paying you and you

197
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:12,101
stopped doing work. You're the
worst. In my defense, I

198
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:15,522
didn't have any money to pay you
with. I didn't

199
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:16,756
Bekah: have any work for you to
do all right. Five minutes.

200
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:17,990
Fine.

201
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:24,402
I'll be fair. It was pandemic.
And there was no work. So he

202
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,022
fired me on accident.

203
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:27,462
Dan: Apparently Nick knew you're
going to say that as well.

204
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:28,902
You're

205
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:29,892
becoming predictable,

206
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:34,001
Bekah: but I feel like we've had
a lot of new members that might

207
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:37,001
not have known that you fired me
many times ago.

208
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:45,432
Dan: So, any way. Yes.
So I don't know about you,

209
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:48,252
Bekah. I spent a lot of time.
I'm like, okay. So what do I

210
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:51,072
wear

211
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:54,011
when I meet a person for the
first time that I've like worked

212
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:56,682
closely with for three years,
obviously virtual, probably

213
00:10:56,682 --> 00:11:01,481
stuff. I wore the t-shirt and
the hoodie. I just wear

214
00:11:01,572 --> 00:11:01,741
Bekah: the

215
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,721
Dan: assignment. Yeah. Well, we
didn't talk about it ahead of

216
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:08,772
time. I almost like texted you.
I almost asked you and I should

217
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:10,751
have, because then we could have
just been totally,

218
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:13,152
Bekah: you know, oh, wait, Arjun
joined and wants to know who

219
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:14,532
fired me. Dan fired

220
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:21,011
Dan: me. No, I did not fire you.
I hate this. I'm shutting this

221
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:21,491
stream down,

222
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:27,731
Bekah: so, okay. So maybe let's
go back a little bit so I can

223
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:31,182
tell the full story and give Dan
the credit that he is owed.

224
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:34,422
I'm a career changer. I spent 10
years teaching college, English,

225
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:38,922
and I went to bootcamp. And when
I graduated, I put out a tweet

226
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:42,761
saying that I was looking for a
job and Dan responded

227
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:49,062
Dan: not really, but seriously.

228
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:56,321
Bekah: So I did not. I
didn't take any coding tests or

229
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:58,960
have to

230
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:03,201
do any. Strange problems that
make no difference in the world.

231
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:08,542
And so, we worked together
until the pandemic hit and then

232
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:12,172
everything shut down. So, yeah.
So then

233
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:16,131
Dan: as soon as I had worked
coming back in that you had

234
00:12:16,131 --> 00:12:21,171
worked coming back in to, you
never say thank you. Yeah,

235
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:26,211
it

236
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:27,351
was a re it was a rough summer.

237
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:29,392
Bekah: It was a weird summer. It
was really rough. And that's how

238
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:31,191
Virtual Coffee started too,
because I was getting signed

239
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:32,990
with

240
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:37,491
interviews with kids at home and
trying to figure out like what

241
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:40,431
life was like. And then I put
out this week, does anybody want

242
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:43,371
to

243
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:45,831
meet up for Virtual Coffee? And
we just kept going with it. And,

244
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:49,236
and somewhere along the line I
pulled Dan in to cause he owed

245
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:52,131
me

246
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:52,942
for firing me.

247
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:05,096
Dan: So here's the one thing I'm
so used to, like talking to

248
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:07,197
you on zoom, we're sitting right
next to each other, but we have

249
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:11,547
the like zoom monitor on the
screen. And so I have been like

250
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:12,852
looking at, I keep looking at
you on the screen instead of,

251
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:14,157
instead

252
00:13:14,157 --> 00:13:15,626
of like you next to me, I don't
even

253
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:16,047
Bekah: understand.

254
00:13:19,346 --> 00:13:20,576
Dan: Right. Exactly. Yeah.
Right. Do I look to camera?

255
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:21,806
Yeah. No,

256
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:25,677
it's weird. Good, weird. But
it's, it's weird, you know?

257
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:31,091
Bekah: Yeah. Okay. Let's see.
Let me look at this chat.

258
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:34,615
Yes,

259
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,797
Nick. Exactly. Dan responded.
I'm looking for someone to fire

260
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:40,447
eventually. Yes, I am totally

261
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:42,297
Dan: wired eventually.

262
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,051
Bekah: No, I had no coding
tests. We had a conversation. I

263
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:48,476
don't

264
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:50,486
know if Dan remembers it, but I
remember,

265
00:13:51,326 --> 00:13:55,706
Dan: I mean, I didn't know
what I was doing either. I mean,

266
00:13:55,706 --> 00:13:57,776
this is the first time I ever,
and to be clear, like you

267
00:13:57,776 --> 00:13:59,846
weren't

268
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:03,506
an employee, so, you know, my
whole thing was contractor, you

269
00:14:03,506 --> 00:14:04,946
know, cause I'm a contractor
too, but, yeah, I'd never

270
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:06,386
done

271
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:08,576
that before. And like, I really
jumped into like very ADHD

272
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:10,766
style,

273
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:16,407
like no real plan, no real, you
know, guidelines for myself or

274
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:18,266
for anybody else or anything
like that. And it worked out

275
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:20,125
very

276
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:27,267
well, but, yeah, it was, it
was, it was, it was fun.

277
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:31,772
Haven't missed any, you
know, I

278
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:32,042
Bekah: dunno.

279
00:14:35,522 --> 00:14:41,371
Dan: Yeah. So, you know,
with like insurance, I've heard

280
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:41,611
is

281
00:14:41,611 --> 00:14:44,322
Bekah: a good thing to know.
Insurance is nice. It's useful.

282
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:51,692
Didn't have that for awhile. So,
yeah. So I've been working a new

283
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:55,892
full-time job, and Dan has
been,

284
00:14:57,361 --> 00:15:01,412
Dan: thank you. If I didn't fire
you there'll be no Virtual

285
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:02,912
Coffee. I didn't fire you

286
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:12,272
Bekah: so I can play it over and
over.

287
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:18,192
Dan: I blamed melts, honestly,
for that, for that one, we went

288
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:20,531
to a mill in here in Lakewood
and it's, I, we walked past the

289
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:22,870
first

290
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:25,841
place. I wanted to go found out,
close for lunch on the weekdays,

291
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:29,142
which I didn't know. But as
we were walking past Milt, I was

292
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:31,751
like, this place makes you want
to go take a nap after like,

293
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:34,212
after. And it's, it's true.
Yeah. I mean the two years

294
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:36,642
probably

295
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:39,491
probably didn't help that
either. But, I blame, yeah.

296
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:40,991
I blame

297
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:45,162
that on that and the mental
lapse. But once you stand from

298
00:15:45,162 --> 00:15:46,451
that, I did not fire anybody.

299
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:49,991
Bekah: I mean, what is your
definition of fire? Okay. He was

300
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:54,131
like, I'm no longer going to
employ you or give you work or

301
00:15:54,131 --> 00:16:04,961
money. So anybody out there
please let me know. So now he's

302
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:07,961
roped into Virtual Coffee
forever.

303
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:18,861
Dan: Anyway. Let's go back to, I
was saying that I was right and

304
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:23,662
that everything that I did was
good. I'm pretty sure that's

305
00:16:23,662 --> 00:16:25,912
what

306
00:16:25,912 --> 00:16:26,451
she said.

307
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:31,341
Bekah: Well, Dan, it sucks that
you fired back and that was

308
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:34,236
pretty awful, but at least we
got Virtual Coffee out of it and

309
00:16:34,236 --> 00:16:37,131
you

310
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:42,456
can fire me any day. I don't
even know what that means.

311
00:16:42,456 --> 00:16:47,781
Sometimes I

312
00:16:47,782 --> 00:16:50,241
like very frequently will spit
out water when I drink it. So I

313
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:53,751
need to try very hard to not
drink and laugh at

314
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:59,966
Dan: the same time. Yeah.
Somebody's episode. That was a

315
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:02,366
really good one to that. Oh
yeah. I watched you do it. I

316
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:04,766
watched

317
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,027
you swallow or like, you know,
start drink water. And then

318
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:07,287
Helen

319
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:12,537
said something hilarious and,
yeah, we, both have a

320
00:17:12,537 --> 00:17:17,787
problem

321
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,517
with, sometimes we, you know, I
don't know if you could get this

322
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:23,876
in zoom where you, why you're
not like making, I kind of take

323
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,727
what's a real person, you know,
but, but like, you almost can,

324
00:17:26,727 --> 00:17:28,017
like sometimes you know, where,
like, you know, you're looking

325
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:29,307
at

326
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:30,177
that person that, you know,
they're looking at you, you

327
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:31,047
know,

328
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:33,231
and, you know, we've had
some, we've had some meltdowns

329
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:34,846
in

330
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:39,086
the past. We try to keep it on
the podcast, but there's been

331
00:17:39,086 --> 00:17:41,666
some. There's been some moments.

332
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:43,842
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. There are
many moments on the podcast

333
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:45,207
we've

334
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:46,646
progressed so much. When we
first started the podcast, I

335
00:17:46,646 --> 00:17:48,085
would

336
00:17:48,086 --> 00:17:49,541
laugh uncontrollably for the
first five minutes. I could

337
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,996
never

338
00:17:50,997 --> 00:17:54,446
do the introduction. I maybe
there's. I don't know if there's

339
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:54,567
any,

340
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:58,346
Dan: for sure. We sure have it
all recorded. I don't know if,

341
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:00,566
yeah. I don't know how much
video we have of it, but like,

342
00:18:00,566 --> 00:18:02,786
we

343
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:05,727
have a lot of views of, of like
trying to do the intros and

344
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:07,526
stuff. It's so funny. Cause
you're so good at it. Like

345
00:18:07,526 --> 00:18:09,325
you're

346
00:18:09,326 --> 00:18:12,896
so good at like this stuff most
of the time and like it's the

347
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:15,057
recorded nature of it. It's like
the reading, the script

348
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:18,836
Bekah: part. It was like, I was
so nervous. Like I was like

349
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:22,076
nervousness decided to turn
itself into laughters and like I

350
00:18:22,076 --> 00:18:25,676
could not stop, which I guess is
like better than crying or

351
00:18:25,676 --> 00:18:29,067
sweating, which I have also gone
through those phases as well.

352
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:32,547
Dan: Yeah, definitely one of my
main skills.

353
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:38,231
Bekah: Just checking out the
chat. Promoted to customer.

354
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:48,392
Dan: Yes. Congratulations. I
don't know pressure valves.

355
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:51,542
Bekah: Yeah. As soon as he
probably would fire me for all

356
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:52,652
of

357
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:58,922
this it's okay. Oh my sure. I'm
an introvert. I dunno. I feel

358
00:18:58,922 --> 00:19:03,541
like maybe I'm an ambivert
ambivert. I am especially like

359
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,862
intensely nervous and shy and
exhausted when I'm around people

360
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:11,612
that I don't know. But like when
I'm around people that I know or

361
00:19:11,612 --> 00:19:13,951
people that I'm friends with
and, I can often like find

362
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:16,290
that

363
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,241
energy. I think that extroverts

364
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:24,692
Dan: have, for me, it's, for me,
it's sort of knowing exactly

365
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:28,862
what, like I was supposed to do
in a situation. That's what I'm

366
00:19:28,862 --> 00:19:32,922
comfortable. Right. And so like
the. This is just you and me

367
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,261
chatting, you know, and like,
we've practiced this obviously.

368
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:36,192
So it's like, you

369
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:36,342
Bekah: know,

370
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:40,916
Dan: can't you tell we did,
like, we did like, this is

371
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,061
yeah.

372
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:44,982
Very polished, you know,
thing. No. But what I mean

373
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:46,872
is

374
00:19:46,872 --> 00:19:49,541
like, I know what socially
is expected of me in this

375
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,210
situation.

376
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:56,471
You know what I mean? And so if
I'm in coffee, like one of our

377
00:19:56,471 --> 00:20:00,402
coffee chats and in a room with
a whole bunch of people, I don't

378
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:02,832
know. I'm not like I don't have
a problem. Like I don't, I don't

379
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:06,161
get like, awkward like that,
but, but when I go to like

380
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:09,490
go to a

381
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:12,162
conference, right. And then
there's like a social hour or

382
00:20:12,162 --> 00:20:15,162
lunch or whatever, and I don't
know people, and I don't know

383
00:20:15,162 --> 00:20:18,192
exactly what I'm supposed to do
or my role in, you know, that's

384
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:20,832
when I get like, that's when I
get like super and I just go and

385
00:20:20,832 --> 00:20:22,662
sit down by myself and put my
headphones on or something, or I

386
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:23,741
don't put my headphones on, but
like, cause I'm fine. If

387
00:20:23,741 --> 00:20:24,820
somebody

388
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:25,856
comes and talks to me, like,
that's cool. Cause that's like

389
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:26,891
a.

390
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:28,557
Hey, this is what you're
supposed to do now, you know,

391
00:20:28,557 --> 00:20:29,442
but like

392
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:31,656
walking up to somebody and
trying to like, that's, that's

393
00:20:31,656 --> 00:20:33,841
what I,

394
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:36,221
like. I really struggled with
that. That's the kind of stuff

395
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:38,922
that I struggled with, you know,
is those, those like situations,

396
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:45,011
Where it's an unfamiliar
territory or like, you know, I

397
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:45,112
don't know.

398
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,311
Bekah: Yeah. So it's like that.
So my dad was just telling my

399
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:52,031
oldest, my 12 year old, he was
talking about how great it is to

400
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:53,846
talk to random people in the
garb and talking to them like

401
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:55,661
that is

402
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,511
a terrible thing. My dad loves
it. Like he will go up to any

403
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:01,541
person and he will probably try
and say what their name, he'll

404
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,031
ask them their name and hope
continually try and repeat that

405
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,551
throughout the conversation, but
then forget their name and use a

406
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:11,711
different name. That's wrong. He
tries very hard to be personal.

407
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:16,362
But that was like, my
worst nightmare talking to a

408
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:18,521
stranger that I don't know about
things.

409
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:21,101
Dan: Yeah. No, my father-in-law
is huge big on that. And he was

410
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:22,961
a

411
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:25,571
bartender and stuff and like, he
just doesn't naturally, like, he

412
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:29,382
doesn't almost like impulsively,
you know, but like, like, in

413
00:21:29,382 --> 00:21:32,172
an elevator or something, he'll
just like chat up and they

414
00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:34,541
probably don't want to talk to
him. I mean, like not like he's

415
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:35,741
not being creepy. Right. And
he's not like hitting on anybody

416
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:36,941
or

417
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:37,662
anything like that, but he's.

418
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:39,281
Bekah: Talking to them.

419
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,011
Dan: great guy. You know what I
mean? And like, but that's just

420
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:48,101
how he is, you know? Yeah.
Somebody said something

421
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:51,131
about

422
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:53,111
Joe said, so what do I do with
my hands? That's a big thing

423
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,191
with me

424
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:57,701
too. And honestly that's like
what I, one of the things I like

425
00:21:57,701 --> 00:22:01,541
about the, this, this phase in
our collective lives of the zoom

426
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,481
stuff is that most times, so
right now my camera's like

427
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:05,651
scooted back a little bit so
that we can both fit in. Most

428
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:06,821
time you

429
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:10,332
can see my hands. And I've
honestly, like during this thing

430
00:22:10,602 --> 00:22:14,652
had been like seeing my hands in
the video and been like, oh God,

431
00:22:14,682 --> 00:22:16,811
get these out of here. You know?
Cause I'm just like, like, I

432
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:17,936
don't know, what do I do with my
hands? Big problem. Yeah. What

433
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,061
do

434
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:23,922
I do with my whole body? Like
standing in a group of people.

435
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:28,047
How do I stay? You know, like
seriously, like I I've struggled

436
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:31,076
with that. You know, like I do
just put my hands in my pockets

437
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:31,977
or, you know, I don't

438
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,616
Bekah: know. I like pockets and
I just don't make enough pockets

439
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:37,826
for women. It's like, even
earlier, Dan and I were like

440
00:22:37,826 --> 00:22:41,247
sitting at this conference table
talking like I move around a lot

441
00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:45,416
and I've like recently become
more aware of how much I move by

442
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:48,297
seeing other people on camera.
And then I'm like constantly, I

443
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:50,247
think someone once gave me like
feedback, don't move your hands

444
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:53,487
so much. It's distracting. Like
whatever, like I'm gonna move my

445
00:22:53,487 --> 00:22:56,967
hands as much as I want it
because I can't. I said, we've

446
00:22:56,967 --> 00:23:00,356
got spinny, Dan's got so many
chairs. So I got to do a lot of

447
00:23:00,356 --> 00:23:03,176
spinning. This is, this is what
I do. I move all the time. But

448
00:23:03,176 --> 00:23:05,996
like

449
00:23:05,997 --> 00:23:07,907
when I'm in front of the camera
in my office, like I very much,

450
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:09,817
I

451
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:14,997
have to try very hard to sit
still and not move my hands

452
00:23:14,997 --> 00:23:17,757
everywhere because that is not
my natural state of.

453
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,747
Dan: I ended there. Yes.

454
00:23:26,497 --> 00:23:29,467
Bekah: we do the wave one time
at Virtual Coffee in my breakout

455
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:33,457
room. We like, we, we
alphabetized everybody and then

456
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:35,946
everybody went, it was very
exciting

457
00:23:39,997 --> 00:23:48,156
Dan: to Minnesota. Marie had to
go yeah,

458
00:23:49,017 --> 00:23:51,162
Bekah: we should. Is, is
Kirk around? Can we bring Kirk

459
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:53,307
on?

460
00:23:54,326 --> 00:24:02,547
Dan: I dunno, it is, Kirk
day, which is where we started.

461
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:08,007
He responded well, that was 20
minutes ago, I guess. Are you

462
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:11,547
dealing in, should I give him
okay. We'll see if I can get

463
00:24:11,547 --> 00:24:12,971
Bekah: her on him. Our
celebrity, our resident

464
00:24:12,971 --> 00:24:14,395
celebrity.

465
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:20,027
Dan: It'll be funny. Because
once we get another person on

466
00:24:20,027 --> 00:24:26,781
this call, You and me we'll be
in one box and, oh man, this

467
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:31,342
Bekah: is crazy. Rick is at
work. What's word two people do

468
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:31,761
Kirk Shillingford: that.

469
00:24:32,662 --> 00:24:37,192
Dan: Don't they know it's Kirk
day. I'm pretty sure they do

470
00:24:37,192 --> 00:24:37,642
because,

471
00:24:38,342 --> 00:24:40,981
Bekah: well, I mean, maybe we
could have any Kirk, Nick has

472
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:42,526
asked. That's a good question.
So in our slack right now, most

473
00:24:42,526 --> 00:24:44,071
of

474
00:24:44,071 --> 00:24:49,422
us have. Put our profile down,
flipped it and reversed it. But

475
00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:50,082
with Kirk's

476
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:57,971
Dan: I see him Kirk, or we're
going to try to get Kirk in to

477
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:06,402
Bekah: join. Remember how to we
are, sorry. We're doing our best

478
00:25:06,402 --> 00:25:09,007
to bring our celebrity on the
stream. At least take 10 fakes

479
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,612
in

480
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:13,211
the chat as well. I want to
shout out to Abby Perini because

481
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,800
she

482
00:25:14,801 --> 00:25:18,731
DME last night, she was like,
after midnight, put up this in

483
00:25:18,731 --> 00:25:21,296
your profile. So Abby has been
an amazing observer of Kirk day,

484
00:25:21,296 --> 00:25:23,861
and

485
00:25:23,862 --> 00:25:29,416
I could not have asked for
anything better. We don't want

486
00:25:29,426 --> 00:25:36,086
break. Where are we breaking out
to turn off the world, please

487
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:38,396
stand up. Yes. Oh my goodness.
We definitely need to, find

488
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:40,706
more

489
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,686
ways to put Kirk into music.

490
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:46,586
Dan: All right. Kirk said he can
join in three minutes. So we

491
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:50,066
just

492
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:51,251
talked about this book for, I
don't know, jokes. I can't

493
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:52,435
really

494
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:56,457
Bekah: all right. I'll tell my
joke. Have you all one about

495
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:57,146
pizza?

496
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:00,936
Dan: Nope. I haven't heard that
one.

497
00:26:03,817 --> 00:26:05,616
Bekah: Nevermind. It's cheesy.

498
00:26:09,717 --> 00:26:10,106
Dan: Man.

499
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:14,517
Bekah: Well, we do the podcast.
Dan always wants me to adjust my

500
00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:16,527
microphone. And so then I try
and tell him jokes, which he

501
00:26:16,527 --> 00:26:18,537
ignores

502
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:22,676
all of the time. And then some
of our guests are nice enough to

503
00:26:22,676 --> 00:26:24,506
laugh. So if you come on the
podcast, please laugh at my

504
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:26,336
jokes

505
00:26:26,906 --> 00:26:30,011
and roll your eyes that day.
Please encourage me in my

506
00:26:30,011 --> 00:26:33,116
keynote

507
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:34,856
talk that I'm giving in July.
I'm just telling jokes for 15

508
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:36,596
minutes

509
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:38,606
straight because I can do
whatever I want.

510
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:41,817
Dan: That's true. You're the
keynote speaker. So that'll be

511
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:49,076
your first and only time being a
key Joseph's to get away. I did

512
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:55,257
not fight. I rejected God to
keep trying to trick

513
00:26:55,257 --> 00:26:58,742
Bekah: me. Can't fire me
anymore. All right. But if

514
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,227
anybody else

515
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:03,936
has jokes, please put them in
the chat and then I will deliver

516
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:05,645
them

517
00:27:05,646 --> 00:27:07,567
because she needs

518
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:11,166
Dan: to deliver them because you
are the worst joke receiver in

519
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:13,146
the world. You know what she
does. Yeah. You know what you do

520
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:14,526
when you, what I ask you, Joe,
when I like, I have, there's

521
00:27:14,526 --> 00:27:15,906
been

522
00:27:15,906 --> 00:27:20,346
times where I've like pulled out
some jokes. Oh yeah. Yeah.

523
00:27:20,376 --> 00:27:23,406
Because I know that you
appreciate them, but she guesses

524
00:27:23,406 --> 00:27:25,311
the answers. She like, she
didn't say, I don't know what

525
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,216
she like

526
00:27:27,936 --> 00:27:33,606
tries to like it's a riddle. No,

527
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,936
Bekah: no. Oh no. Dan, I don't
know. Can you tell me the

528
00:27:36,936 --> 00:27:39,036
answer?

529
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:43,461
Dan: No, that's not. What are
you doing? You're fired again.

530
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:46,296
Not

531
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,436
again for the first time.

532
00:27:53,557 --> 00:27:56,257
Bekah: C. Exactly. Thank you,
Joe. Joe knows. It's not joke.

533
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,366
It's a challenge. Every joke is
the.

534
00:27:59,297 --> 00:28:02,477
Dan: That's not a, it's not a
joke,

535
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:05,777
Bekah: but a joke then is like a
story that you tell with a

536
00:28:05,777 --> 00:28:07,517
punchline at the end in

537
00:28:08,846 --> 00:28:20,656
Dan: your oh, weird Kirk here.
Okay. Well, according to

538
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:25,997
Kirk, one minute left, so we'll
see, Kirk was not consulted at

539
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:30,166
all for any of this. That is
true. I try not to consult Kirk

540
00:28:30,797 --> 00:28:32,326
at a time on things where

541
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:33,136
Bekah: we need

542
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:38,566
Dan: right, exactly. Or, you
know, where he might have time

543
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:40,365
to

544
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:44,416
think about whether he wants to
engage with us. We try to try to

545
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,862
pull him in, you know, before he
has a channel. You know? Yeah,

546
00:28:47,951 --> 00:28:48,221
Bekah: no,

547
00:28:48,221 --> 00:28:48,971
Dan: we avoid my

548
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:52,842
Bekah: ridiculousness, Joe. Yes,
we do need a scoreboard. Maybe

549
00:28:52,842 --> 00:28:58,872
that will be next month. Monthly
challenge, 97 and counting.

550
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:05,231
Dan: Oh God. How did I not see
that coming? Honestly,

551
00:29:05,741 --> 00:29:08,442
Bekah: I don't know. I didn't
even think about it. And so we

552
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:17,321
started talking and you brought
it up. Yes. A slack channel or a

553
00:29:17,321 --> 00:29:20,352
slack bot that posts every time
that Dan fires

554
00:29:20,352 --> 00:29:24,001
Dan: me. How about a select
button that just announces the

555
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:24,571
Bekah is fire.

556
00:29:25,922 --> 00:29:28,201
Bekah: Everybody just
continuously buyers' me over and

557
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:32,653
over. It's okay. Just keep
firing me. It's fine. Just

558
00:29:32,653 --> 00:29:37,105
preparing to

559
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:38,861
be up here. Yeah, he probably,
sorry, Kirk, we're sorry that

560
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,616
you

561
00:29:40,616 --> 00:29:42,446
have to prepare for us. We were
trying to send a drone that

562
00:29:42,446 --> 00:29:44,276
would

563
00:29:44,277 --> 00:29:47,067
just go scoop up Kirk and bring
him to Cleveland.

564
00:29:47,817 --> 00:29:51,686
Dan: Well, maybe it's you will
cut out the echo. I was just

565
00:29:51,686 --> 00:29:56,426
thinking I have headphones and
then I was, I don't know how to

566
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:58,756
do that. Really. We're just
going to try it. And I'm going

567
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:01,086
to count

568
00:30:01,086 --> 00:30:03,456
on you guys to tell us if
there's a bad echo, cause I'm

569
00:30:03,456 --> 00:30:05,826
just going

570
00:30:05,826 --> 00:30:06,876
to play it over the speakers.
And because zoom is actually

571
00:30:06,876 --> 00:30:07,926
usually

572
00:30:07,926 --> 00:30:11,737
pretty good at that. Like, I
mean, if that's all we have to

573
00:30:11,737 --> 00:30:15,247
do, you know, we can do
AirPods or something, but like,

574
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:19,507
that'll be annoying. I have, I'm
trying to think if there's any

575
00:30:19,507 --> 00:30:27,446
other solution, literally this
is the first time I've ever. Sat

576
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:31,047
next to somebody and try to be
beyond,

577
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:35,696
Bekah: you know, I mean, if I
have my computer, I can, yeah.

578
00:30:35,696 --> 00:30:35,997
And then like

579
00:30:35,997 --> 00:30:38,727
Dan: you could go over the other
fucking room and do that like,

580
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:42,146
oh, sorry. I did not mean to
curse, but she made me have two

581
00:30:42,146 --> 00:30:44,756
beers and she, you know, she
forced me to do it and,

582
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:47,366
which

583
00:30:47,366 --> 00:30:49,196
I've been meaning to talk to HR
about. And they said you're

584
00:30:49,196 --> 00:30:56,366
fired. The reason I swerve is
because like you going out

585
00:30:56,366 --> 00:30:58,586
somewhere else sounds not
nothing is my

586
00:30:58,586 --> 00:31:02,636
Bekah: point. I meant just have
my computer and log on and I

587
00:31:02,636 --> 00:31:06,116
would sit here, but just so I
could put the sound in my ear,

588
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:07,421
Dan: I feel like you'd get a
delay, plus you'd hear me

589
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:08,365
through

590
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:17,007
there too. And through here too.
So we're going to try.

591
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:21,477
Bekah: Do they have like covers
for your air positive. You're

592
00:31:21,477 --> 00:31:22,796
sharing them for someone else.
Like, you know how like they

593
00:31:22,796 --> 00:31:24,115
have

594
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:27,987
like the tongue depressor and
they cover it or like the ear

595
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:30,176
thing, they put a little thing.
Do they have one of those for

596
00:31:30,176 --> 00:31:30,747
your AirPods?

597
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:34,647
Dan: The, that's as soon as
I thought that that's where like

598
00:31:34,647 --> 00:31:37,317
my

599
00:31:37,317 --> 00:31:39,926
AirPods or like grocery now, I
wouldn't want to share that with

600
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:41,246
anybody. So that would be an
embarrassing thing to do as

601
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:42,566
well.

602
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:50,156
There has to be some sort of
like, I don't know. I feel like

603
00:31:50,156 --> 00:31:51,476
back in the day they used to
have a lot of cool things where

604
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:52,796
you'd

605
00:31:52,797 --> 00:31:55,076
split the, you know, I probably
honestly, yeah, where they'd

606
00:31:55,076 --> 00:31:57,355
have

607
00:31:57,356 --> 00:32:00,057
a little splitter. So you have
your iPod and the cord with the

608
00:32:00,057 --> 00:32:04,586
two things, and then you could
sit next to your friend in the,

609
00:32:04,707 --> 00:32:06,911
or in the bus or the car and
both of them the same thing.

610
00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:09,115
Yeah. But

611
00:32:09,116 --> 00:32:13,287
those were recorded, you know,
they were like, no, I feel like

612
00:32:13,287 --> 00:32:17,291
cool. Kids in high school that
listened to cool music and had

613
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:23,382
cool friends. I didn't have it
either. It just seemed cool.

614
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:30,701
Bekah: Kirk is talking. It's set
up there. Where is he? Kirk,

615
00:32:31,271 --> 00:32:31,362
are

616
00:32:31,362 --> 00:32:35,007
Kirk: you here? I mean, I can
see you. I want you to know, I

617
00:32:35,007 --> 00:32:38,652
just

618
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:41,576
shouted watching the stream
while I was getting ready. And

619
00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:44,500
then

620
00:32:45,071 --> 00:32:46,301
there, wasn't a moment where I'm
like, this is there's a lot

621
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:47,531
going

622
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:51,056
on here. I don't know where I
fit in. Don't have any jokes

623
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:54,581
and

624
00:32:54,582 --> 00:33:05,547
I don't have any jokes, rule
formats. So, you know, Bekah. I

625
00:33:05,547 --> 00:33:07,977
feel like, what do you think are
jokes and not what other people

626
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:19,467
put them together and said, that
is all of jokes.

627
00:33:25,017 --> 00:33:27,671
Dan: I'm so glad you're here.
Says that was decades ago. I

628
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:30,325
know

629
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:33,626
it was because it was high
school. Thank you for putting

630
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:40,017
that out there. I appreciate
that. All right. Everybody else

631
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:43,916
has said there's no audio
issues. We are good.

632
00:33:44,277 --> 00:33:48,386
Bekah: And we got the celebrity
of the year here. Welcome. It's

633
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:48,896
been a great

634
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:50,396
Dan: year. The multi-verse

635
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:53,446
Kirk: yeah, this entire day,
I've just been seeing threats

636
00:33:53,446 --> 00:33:55,345
and

637
00:33:55,346 --> 00:33:57,507
going. I don't remember talking
about,

638
00:34:00,557 --> 00:34:02,576
Dan: I've been having the
opposite problem where I read as

639
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:05,467
reading through a thread and was
like, Oh, who wrote that? Oh,

640
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:05,757
that was

641
00:34:05,757 --> 00:34:08,876
Bekah: me. Dad said, I think
we're at lunches.

642
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:15,536
Kirk: Yes. This is again, I just
want to make the record clear

643
00:34:15,536 --> 00:34:21,297
that I was not consulted about
any of this mocha I saw, I just

644
00:34:21,297 --> 00:34:23,186
assumed slack. Wasn't working.

645
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:26,156
Bekah: Nick Taylor, like
somebody would maybe read out

646
00:34:26,156 --> 00:34:27,566
was like,

647
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,746
I'm seeing pictures of Kirk and
Nick is like, it happens

648
00:34:30,746 --> 00:34:33,777
sometimes. And it does like
sometimes slack put other

649
00:34:33,777 --> 00:34:34,737
people's pictures

650
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:37,976
Dan: upside down, you know, and

651
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:38,336
Bekah: flipped it.

652
00:34:39,896 --> 00:34:42,567
Kirk: Okay. So I'm going to be
clear. I was very dense. It took

653
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:46,297
me way too long to figure out
that's what that was. Again, I'm

654
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:50,567
probably just not working. And
then I thought it was like, oh,

655
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:54,597
okay. Let's add a one way for
Kirk to distinguish himself and

656
00:34:54,597 --> 00:34:57,597
other people. But it wasn't even
about me, which I feel like is

657
00:34:57,597 --> 00:35:01,436
Bekah: the perfect

658
00:35:01,436 --> 00:35:05,336
Kirk: days about. That's really
what, it's a, it's a VC event.

659
00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:05,847
I'm just

660
00:35:07,376 --> 00:35:09,626
Bekah: celebrating how much we
love Kurt.

661
00:35:12,146 --> 00:35:12,356
Kirk: We're

662
00:35:12,356 --> 00:35:14,876
Bekah: lucky that Missy Elliott
responded to you. So we can

663
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:18,507
remember every day it's like
Valentine's day because some

664
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:21,027
people don't like Valentine's
day. Cause they're like, what is

665
00:35:21,027 --> 00:35:24,657
this? It's a commercial holiday
too. So us chocolate and flowers

666
00:35:24,717 --> 00:35:29,217
and cars. And, but it's also a
day to like remind you to stop

667
00:35:29,217 --> 00:35:33,507
and think like, oh, I am going
to, tell this person that I

668
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,862
love them today. Right? And so
like, we often forget to tell

669
00:35:35,862 --> 00:35:38,217
you

670
00:35:38,217 --> 00:35:42,056
every single day that we love
you, Kirk. So this is our Kirk

671
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:45,836
Valentine's day slash Missy
Elliot day. We do

672
00:35:45,836 --> 00:35:49,137
Kirk: love you. We love you.
Let's see, I wasn't prepared for

673
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:49,706
this either, but

674
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:55,586
Dan: since it's Kirk day, do you
want to back.

675
00:35:56,786 --> 00:36:05,637
Kirk: No. I mean, I feel like I
have to be the one person who

676
00:36:05,637 --> 00:36:06,416
doesn't fight.

677
00:36:08,246 --> 00:36:08,936
Dan: Tell me if people

678
00:36:08,936 --> 00:36:10,646
Bekah: need to think of me.

679
00:36:10,947 --> 00:36:13,677
Kirk: I mean, just based on the
chat response, people seem to be

680
00:36:13,677 --> 00:36:17,592
really into UV as much as like
on their tier list of events,

681
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:21,507
Kirk

682
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:25,617
day, back of being fired. That's
what the people want.

683
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:32,126
Bekah: The people want me to be
fine. I don't even know what to

684
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:35,487
do. I'm going to have to like,
think about this very hard on my

685
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:39,927
two and a half hour, drive out.
Why everybody loves me fired.

686
00:36:40,677 --> 00:36:43,976
Kirk: Well, you seem to be like
really enthused about it too,

687
00:36:45,356 --> 00:36:47,306
because you're the one who
brings it up. Dan, doesn't

688
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:47,786
Bekah: bring it up.

689
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:52,646
Kirk: It's like your origin
story. It is,

690
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:54,626
Bekah: it is my origin story.

691
00:36:58,407 --> 00:37:01,467
Kirk: Not the teaching, not the
women who is it's like it all

692
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:08,967
started when Dan fire and then a
passion live inside, less

693
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:10,991
Bekah: fire. My other origin
story is not, it's. It's

694
00:37:10,991 --> 00:37:13,015
not,

695
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:19,916
it's rated PG 13 decoding.

696
00:37:21,117 --> 00:37:26,657
Kirk: Oh, why did I get into
coding? I didn't, you

697
00:37:26,657 --> 00:37:29,146
Bekah: can tell that one, but
then people always feel awkward.

698
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:32,027
Cause like when someone asks you
how you got into coding and you

699
00:37:32,027 --> 00:37:34,757
use the word vagina, they're
suddenly like, oh, weird about

700
00:37:34,757 --> 00:37:37,427
it. Yeah, for sure. I don't
think you can say that in a PG

701
00:37:37,427 --> 00:37:40,097
movie,

702
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:46,666
you can drop one. F-bomb in a PG
13 movie. So we're still a PG 13

703
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:48,407
here. We're good, Dan.

704
00:37:50,456 --> 00:37:50,697
Dan: What's

705
00:37:53,637 --> 00:37:55,166
Kirk: it because

706
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:58,166
Bekah: he already dropped one
today. He thought her one and

707
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:01,106
only he was like, I'm going to
be the one that hit the

708
00:38:01,106 --> 00:38:02,577
Dan: truck. Cause I was worried
about you leaving.

709
00:38:04,706 --> 00:38:07,016
Kirk: Okay. Yeah. I know you're
in Dan's house now. So you get

710
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:09,146
like what's the body

711
00:38:10,056 --> 00:38:12,451
Dan: is my office it's office.
Oh yeah. It's actually a

712
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:14,846
Sprockets

713
00:38:14,936 --> 00:38:16,451
office, which is who I do most
of the work through. But I have

714
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:17,966
my

715
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:20,247
own like, well, I don't know
this stuff. You know, I have my

716
00:38:20,247 --> 00:38:22,527
own

717
00:38:22,527 --> 00:38:23,817
room. That is my office.

718
00:38:27,577 --> 00:38:28,137
Kirk: I have like,

719
00:38:29,786 --> 00:38:31,166
Dan: there's a suite of offices.

720
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:35,987
Bekah: It's got its own little
pod. There's a conference in a

721
00:38:35,987 --> 00:38:36,916
couple of offices.

722
00:38:37,487 --> 00:38:38,687
Kirk: I believe that you are
both in a tree house. I don't

723
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:39,887
believe

724
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:41,297
anything you say. I

725
00:38:41,297 --> 00:38:42,226
Bekah: would like to be in a
tree

726
00:38:42,226 --> 00:38:45,606
Dan: house. I laid, I went,
To last week, when was I going?

727
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:48,986
I

728
00:38:48,987 --> 00:38:52,137
don't know, two weeks ago,
whatever it was to Amish country

729
00:38:52,137 --> 00:38:54,326
and got a tree house like
Airbnb, it's like a newly built

730
00:38:54,326 --> 00:38:56,515
thing

731
00:38:56,516 --> 00:38:57,851
that was like, well, we raised
up in the trees and stuff. It

732
00:38:57,851 --> 00:38:59,186
was

733
00:38:59,186 --> 00:39:01,646
really cool. Yeah. Highly
recommend

734
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:04,181
Bekah: Gemma. And I drove
through Amish country recently

735
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:05,696
on

736
00:39:05,697 --> 00:39:07,661
accident. Cause I made a wrong
turn and we went for shopping

737
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:09,625
and

738
00:39:09,626 --> 00:39:12,806
I, I got some large plastic bins
for $3, each

739
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:14,967
Kirk: much plastic things.

740
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:15,896
Bekah: No

741
00:39:17,637 --> 00:39:20,097
Dan: one thing I learned this
trip, lots of Amish people now

742
00:39:20,126 --> 00:39:23,786
are into e-bikes, which was a
surprise to me, but it was cool.

743
00:39:24,266 --> 00:39:27,447
And it made sense once I thought
about it. So like lots of,

744
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:30,056
and it was honestly, there was a
couple of men, mostly a lot of

745
00:39:30,056 --> 00:39:32,201
women riding around on the
country highways. I mean the

746
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:34,346
same

747
00:39:34,347 --> 00:39:37,706
house as the buggies are riding
on, but like, but they're just

748
00:39:37,706 --> 00:39:40,376
like, and they usually had a
little bike trailer, you know,

749
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:44,831
but they're just like fine out.
I went on. That's

750
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:46,871
Kirk: cool, interesting fun
fact. Early in the history of

751
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:48,911
bikes,

752
00:39:49,061 --> 00:39:52,751
there was like a massive
upsurge in popularity with women

753
00:39:53,112 --> 00:39:55,811
because it gave them like assets
to travel and like see their

754
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,611
friends without having to like
go through their husbands. And

755
00:39:57,611 --> 00:39:59,411
so

756
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:02,172
there was like a big like
reactionary thing so that people

757
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:05,862
there like published articles
about like the bicycle. Is it

758
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:09,592
ruining your woman to stay home
again? Is that how that goes?

759
00:40:09,592 --> 00:40:13,322
But

760
00:40:13,322 --> 00:40:15,427
I just, I used to imagine some
like do just like these

761
00:40:15,427 --> 00:40:17,532
bicycles,

762
00:40:17,952 --> 00:40:19,541
they're hanging out with their
shreds.

763
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:23,711
Bekah: I don't ride a bicycle. I
don't ride

764
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:24,342
Kirk: bicycles.

765
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:28,811
Dan: Well, both. You don't know
how to ride a

766
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:31,632
Bekah: bike? Well, I, I did, but
then I fell off it too many

767
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:34,751
times. So I stopped. I don't
know. I mean, do you know how,

768
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:37,870
if

769
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:41,396
you keep falling down. I had a
bunch of stitches in my elbow.

770
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:43,677
See, there's still scar there. I
don't think you can see that on

771
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:49,077
screen. Thanks for confirming.
It was larger. Okay. For a long

772
00:40:49,077 --> 00:40:54,356
time, I once ran into a pole
while riding on a bicycle.

773
00:40:57,327 --> 00:41:02,097
Dan: I don't ride bicycle as
that a flat path. I think, I

774
00:41:02,097 --> 00:41:06,867
feel

775
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:08,217
like, you know how you're just
not good at it and that's fine.

776
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:09,567
I

777
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:12,686
mean like you you're allowed to
be not good at things, but you

778
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:15,117
know how to ride a bike. There's
my point. You saying I'm not

779
00:41:15,117 --> 00:41:15,297
Bekah: good

780
00:41:15,297 --> 00:41:18,867
Dan: at riding bikes challenge,
challenge. I just don't

781
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:21,237
Kirk: know. How can you swim?

782
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:23,277
Bekah: I'm a great swimmer.

783
00:41:23,907 --> 00:41:26,217
Kirk: Okay. I'm just trying to
figure out like in a triathlon,

784
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:37,677
like where are you struggling?
So it's like swimming, running,

785
00:41:37,677 --> 00:41:38,067
cycling.

786
00:41:39,027 --> 00:41:42,476
Bekah: Yes. Yeah, that's it.
I don't know. I probably would

787
00:41:42,476 --> 00:41:45,356
not ride a skateboard. I tried
to do that with my child's

788
00:41:45,356 --> 00:41:47,291
skateboard and I was like, this
is going to break my hip. Yeah.

789
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:49,226
I

790
00:41:49,226 --> 00:41:51,071
was just worried about my no
sled riding. I once almost broke

791
00:41:51,071 --> 00:41:52,916
my

792
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:55,527
hip sled riding. I had to go to
the emergency room. It wasn't

793
00:41:55,527 --> 00:42:00,806
broken, but gave me lifelong
problems. I was on a mattress. I

794
00:42:00,806 --> 00:42:03,746
sled road on a mattress. That
was a bad idea. So I was like,

795
00:42:03,746 --> 00:42:06,686
not

796
00:42:06,686 --> 00:42:09,686
good at sled riding. And so then
these boys in college, they were

797
00:42:09,686 --> 00:42:14,277
like, Hey, let's take this
mattress and we'll go on it. And

798
00:42:14,277 --> 00:42:17,487
you'll land on the mattress and
it's soft. And that makes sense.

799
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:21,686
Well, okay. So there was a ramp,
but I was like, don't come over

800
00:42:21,686 --> 00:42:22,916
the ring. They promised they
wouldn't go over the ramp and

801
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,146
you

802
00:42:24,146 --> 00:42:26,907
know what happened? Everybody
ditched the mattress except me

803
00:42:26,907 --> 00:42:30,896
and one other guy. And he landed
on top of me and he was 200. I

804
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:33,626
landed on my head on the sound
good. I

805
00:42:34,226 --> 00:42:38,336
Kirk: started with, I'm not good
at sled writing, but as far as

806
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:41,456
I'm aware, now, I remember where
I live. So I'm admittedly

807
00:42:41,456 --> 00:42:45,327
ignorant of these things, but
aren't you just, isn't it just

808
00:42:45,327 --> 00:42:47,277
like it's happening to you.

809
00:42:48,027 --> 00:42:50,597
Dan: It's mostly the ramp. That
was a problem. I feel like

810
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:54,746
Bekah: it's easiest thing.
You're totally

811
00:42:54,746 --> 00:42:58,047
Dan: right though. You just like
sit on the sled and then let us

812
00:42:59,097 --> 00:43:00,536
Bekah: know sometimes like you
reckon,

813
00:43:01,347 --> 00:43:06,356
Dan: I like the part about sled
riding is picking your spot.

814
00:43:06,387 --> 00:43:09,356
Cause if you go where there's
like huge ramps or like, I don't

815
00:43:09,356 --> 00:43:12,447
know where else you crashed, but
like trees and stuff. Probably

816
00:43:12,447 --> 00:43:16,137
not what slides are hard to
steal. Like they don't, they

817
00:43:16,137 --> 00:43:19,586
don't, they don't, they're not
going to like do a sharp turn

818
00:43:19,586 --> 00:43:19,976
steer.

819
00:43:20,217 --> 00:43:22,766
Bekah: I remastered my fear
though. My brother is down the

820
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:27,206
street and has a great sled
riding. I have gone down that

821
00:43:27,206 --> 00:43:27,867
hill multiple times.

822
00:43:28,047 --> 00:43:30,491
Dan: You see them, you can
affect like, like slow gradual

823
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:32,935
turns on

824
00:43:32,936 --> 00:43:37,137
sleds. You know what I mean? But
like what I'm saying, you can

825
00:43:37,137 --> 00:43:38,877
turn slowly while you're going
fast, straight down, but you

826
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:40,617
have

827
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:42,431
to plan ahead. You have to plan
ahead or just ditch. It is what

828
00:43:42,431 --> 00:43:44,245
I

829
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:45,237
would, I do want to control.

830
00:43:47,067 --> 00:43:49,137
Bekah: He says I lift heavy
things and I flip them down.

831
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:50,242
Dan: Somebody said, we should do
a challenge, a bike ride shot.

832
00:43:50,242 --> 00:43:51,347
It

833
00:43:51,356 --> 00:43:56,126
would be it. I can actually sit
on a bike and not move and not

834
00:43:56,126 --> 00:43:56,577
fall over.

835
00:43:56,907 --> 00:44:00,086
Bekah: Deanna has a nickname for
his bike riding.

836
00:44:01,617 --> 00:44:08,067
Dan: Yeah. It's all shot. Yeah,
somebody named, I got it

837
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:10,586
originally from bike riding,
but, that was, I don't know

838
00:44:10,586 --> 00:44:12,926
what

839
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:18,567
all that stuff was with. Yeah.
Like beg his daughters, sent

840
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:23,202
me a poop emoji drawings because
every time they come on, Thing.

841
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:25,902
And they always want, you know,
whatever they're waving and

842
00:44:25,902 --> 00:44:27,581
stuff. And so I just started
sending people from what he's

843
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,021
named fight or flights. Well,

844
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:32,722
Kirk: I've always, that's been
very validating to me. Bekah's

845
00:44:32,742 --> 00:44:34,707
family associates being with
like pancakes and hot sauce and

846
00:44:34,707 --> 00:44:36,672
like

847
00:44:36,702 --> 00:44:37,362
van kits.

848
00:44:39,282 --> 00:44:40,947
Bekah: So I don't think anybody
knows this story. So one

849
00:44:40,947 --> 00:44:42,612
morning,

850
00:44:42,641 --> 00:44:46,271
a couple of weeks ago we were
making pancakes and my daughters

851
00:44:46,271 --> 00:44:50,561
decided they were going to make
pan Kirk's some pancakes that

852
00:44:50,561 --> 00:44:54,101
looked like Kirk. And then
they argued over who would eat

853
00:44:54,101 --> 00:44:57,072
the pan Kirk, but then it, we
only had a little bit of battery

854
00:44:57,072 --> 00:45:00,641
life. So there was only one pan
Kirk and it looked like a tiny

855
00:45:00,641 --> 00:45:05,621
baby. So I think Gemma, a baby
Kirk, Kirk is like, that is

856
00:45:06,222 --> 00:45:08,202
strange. And

857
00:45:08,202 --> 00:45:11,742
Kirk: she sent me this like,
look, they made like, there's

858
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:18,851
nothing special about the
pancakes, small pancake. There's

859
00:45:18,851 --> 00:45:22,481
no like chocolate chip face is
just a pancake.

860
00:45:22,811 --> 00:45:24,702
Bekah: We did our best with what
we had. Okay.

861
00:45:28,302 --> 00:45:33,222
Kirk: Don't tell them it's very
heartwarming, but also quite

862
00:45:33,222 --> 00:45:36,492
strange. I only know how to
make pancakes from scratch, not

863
00:45:36,492 --> 00:45:39,851
the mix. And we're like
proportions. I learned it at, or

864
00:45:39,851 --> 00:45:42,641
the only way I can do it. So I
can only make like enough

865
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:45,506
pancakes, like a full family,
but my family quickly, like you

866
00:45:45,506 --> 00:45:48,371
don't

867
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:52,572
want pancakes. So I would just
eat like two pounds of pancakes

868
00:45:52,572 --> 00:45:53,021
myself.

869
00:45:53,052 --> 00:45:53,561
Bekah: Cause I know.

870
00:45:56,862 --> 00:45:58,032
Dan: It's true. They're good.
That way.

871
00:45:58,961 --> 00:46:01,211
Kirk: Or I could eat two pounds,
right.

872
00:46:01,211 --> 00:46:04,572
Dan: So yeah, bragging at this
point is you get to eat two

873
00:46:04,572 --> 00:46:04,931
pounds of,

874
00:46:05,442 --> 00:46:08,202
Kirk: and then I go up to them
like you made them do this.

875
00:46:11,981 --> 00:46:16,331
Dan: I, so we were talking,
I mean, we wanted to hang out in

876
00:46:16,331 --> 00:46:18,552
the stream or whatever, and just
hang out with people. We talked

877
00:46:18,552 --> 00:46:21,311
about doing a podcast, like
making this like a live podcast

878
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:26,442
episode. I realized that we
didn't do a random question or

879
00:46:26,442 --> 00:46:30,072
anything like that. So I was
just, I don't have a plan for

880
00:46:30,072 --> 00:46:31,556
this. I was thinking about
somebody has a as, as a good,

881
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:33,040
you

882
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,862
know, random question or Kirk,
if you, while in

883
00:46:35,862 --> 00:46:39,536
Kirk: VC, today or riddle really
icebreaker was which part of

884
00:46:39,536 --> 00:46:43,210
not,

885
00:46:43,211 --> 00:46:46,092
which part of your body hurts.
Cause the answer can be multiple

886
00:46:46,331 --> 00:46:50,231
will, like, which is the one
you've noticed hurting like most

887
00:46:50,231 --> 00:46:53,922
recently. Cause somehow we just
all started talking to you about

888
00:46:53,922 --> 00:46:54,271
the parts.

889
00:46:55,496 --> 00:46:59,257
Bekah: That's my traps. I trust

890
00:47:00,447 --> 00:47:01,376
Dan: which ones are your trucks?

891
00:47:05,726 --> 00:47:09,777
Bekah: I have builds up too much
muscle, and now it's very tight

892
00:47:10,257 --> 00:47:12,086
and it hurts every day. No
problem.

893
00:47:14,817 --> 00:47:18,567
Dan: I didn't do many trap
exercises. So yeah,

894
00:47:18,927 --> 00:47:21,416
Kirk: when I was actually in
school, I did all the triangle

895
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:22,186
workouts I saw

896
00:47:22,717 --> 00:47:24,167
Dan: I get in the gym and I
think geometry I'm like, you

897
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:25,617
know, the

898
00:47:25,617 --> 00:47:35,157
strap designs Robinson's and you
got to get the whole, the acute

899
00:47:35,336 --> 00:47:37,601
and the acute and the up twos
triangles, and then make sure

900
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:39,866
you

901
00:47:39,867 --> 00:47:43,312
hit the, what's the what's
the perfect triangle. Equal

902
00:47:43,312 --> 00:47:46,757
equal

903
00:47:47,036 --> 00:47:48,821
lateral equal lateral triangle
as well. Make sure you hit all

904
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:50,606
three

905
00:47:50,606 --> 00:47:52,976
of those. If you want to do a
full workout, then you get into

906
00:47:52,976 --> 00:47:55,181
the 3d and you get some cubes
and you know, you get some,

907
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:57,386
other

908
00:47:57,387 --> 00:48:00,717
Hedron oh man, this is where I
almost had it.

909
00:48:02,907 --> 00:48:06,387
Kirk: And this is what we're
saying. And then someone in the

910
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:10,286
slack was like, who could lift
more weight? Like who could like

911
00:48:10,286 --> 00:48:12,717
deadlift more? I'm like, it's,
it's definitely that,

912
00:48:12,746 --> 00:48:15,927
Dan: Deadlift, deadlift,
Bekah would very easily. I mean,

913
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:18,447
most of these probably she would
anyway, but like a, a deadlift,

914
00:48:18,956 --> 00:48:21,327
any of the ones where you need a
form, you need form and stuff.

915
00:48:21,327 --> 00:48:24,416
Like that's all the proper form
I'm saying I would just kill

916
00:48:24,416 --> 00:48:26,051
myself. Like I would like my
back or something. You know what

917
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:27,686
I

918
00:48:27,686 --> 00:48:32,157
mean? I have literally never
works out. Like I'm fairly

919
00:48:32,157 --> 00:48:34,016
strong, but Bekah works out all
the time. If it is very strong,

920
00:48:34,016 --> 00:48:35,875
I

921
00:48:35,876 --> 00:48:37,853
feel like a. I feel like a bench
press is where, like, I feel

922
00:48:37,853 --> 00:48:39,830
like

923
00:48:39,831 --> 00:48:43,101
a bench press, I probably could
equal her because I don't have

924
00:48:43,101 --> 00:48:46,371
to

925
00:48:46,371 --> 00:48:49,641
worry about hurting myself very
badly because of my back. You

926
00:48:49,641 --> 00:48:52,791
know what I mean? Then it's just
like, and then it's, you know,

927
00:48:53,632 --> 00:48:57,831
but like any of the ones that
like requires skill, I mean,

928
00:48:58,461 --> 00:49:01,222
Bekah: Jesse and I talked about
it last night. I was like, I

929
00:49:01,222 --> 00:49:02,481
think Dan could crush me in,

930
00:49:02,911 --> 00:49:05,541
Dan: I'm like for somebody
who

931
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:09,561
Kirk: doesn't ever work, but I
want to know is wins cycling. I

932
00:49:09,561 --> 00:49:10,882
think you could have an edge
there.

933
00:49:11,722 --> 00:49:17,782
Bekah: Oh, for sure. I don't
know how to cycle stationary

934
00:49:17,782 --> 00:49:22,311
Kirk: bicycle after like elbow
scar McGee over there. We've got

935
00:49:22,311 --> 00:49:22,641
to change

936
00:49:23,052 --> 00:49:25,402
Dan: if we're going to have it.
So somebody mentioned triathlons

937
00:49:25,402 --> 00:49:28,731
and there's like triathlon teams
too. So like they have like team

938
00:49:28,731 --> 00:49:31,496
for competition, you know, as
well. So. If we did a triathlon,

939
00:49:31,496 --> 00:49:35,936
would you do run or swim?
Probably swim. All right. So

940
00:49:35,936 --> 00:49:37,617
Kirk, that means you're on
running.

941
00:49:40,797 --> 00:49:49,677
Kirk: What am I better at than
the two of you jokes? Oh, be

942
00:49:49,697 --> 00:49:51,237
better at sports wise.

943
00:49:51,806 --> 00:49:54,626
Dan: No, Joe Bekah, when it
pushups easily.

944
00:49:55,496 --> 00:49:58,907
Bekah: Oh, I don't know. I, my
shoulder is Kirk is still in the

945
00:49:58,907 --> 00:50:00,626
a hundred push-ups challenge,
right?

946
00:50:00,987 --> 00:50:03,447
Kirk: Yeah. But I don't do like
the full ones I'm doing like

947
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:04,016
incline.

948
00:50:05,847 --> 00:50:07,796
Bekah: I, my, I hear my
shoulder. I have a torn

949
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,745
something. Yeah. My

950
00:50:09,746 --> 00:50:09,896
thing

951
00:50:09,896 --> 00:50:12,416
Dan: with, with pushups,
honestly, that bothers me is my

952
00:50:12,416 --> 00:50:13,856
wrists are flexible for my

953
00:50:13,856 --> 00:50:14,336
Bekah: research.

954
00:50:16,737 --> 00:50:17,007
Dan: Like they

955
00:50:17,007 --> 00:50:20,246
Bekah: don't like my right wrist
from using the mask all the time

956
00:50:20,246 --> 00:50:21,597
is definitely tighter than my
left

957
00:50:21,597 --> 00:50:24,146
Dan: one. I'm sure I could work
on it if I want it to.

958
00:50:24,177 --> 00:50:26,456
Kirk: But yeah, the tunnel, the
tunnel I traveled through the

959
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:30,461
most as harmful for sure. They
have those things, like those

960
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:33,311
things you can hold instead of
pressing your arms flat on the

961
00:50:33,311 --> 00:50:35,936
ground, they just, they hurt
your arm in a different way. So

962
00:50:35,936 --> 00:50:38,561
I'm

963
00:50:38,561 --> 00:50:40,541
like this just transferred the
pain from like doing this to

964
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:42,521
like

965
00:50:42,521 --> 00:50:46,302
straight through. So it doesn't
help at all. Yeah. Did

966
00:50:46,302 --> 00:50:49,931
Dan: you read next pivot? No.
Nick just says, I saw someone

967
00:50:49,931 --> 00:50:52,481
mountain biking on a unicycle in
a forest outside of Montreal. I

968
00:50:52,481 --> 00:51:00,356
wave to them and they just
imagine them like doing a jump

969
00:51:00,356 --> 00:51:08,231
on

970
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:13,452
a unicycle, waving to Nick, and
then like seeing them veer off

971
00:51:13,452 --> 00:51:15,492
into a tree and yelling soccer,
light blue or something.

972
00:51:16,601 --> 00:51:19,001
Kirk: It's like the office. They
have to yell our core, our

973
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:21,072
Bekah: core. Oh my gosh. My kids
love that

974
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:23,081
Kirk: that'll away.

975
00:51:24,731 --> 00:51:25,001
Bekah: Yeah.

976
00:51:26,231 --> 00:51:28,136
Dan: I've seen those for sure.
So people do like insane things

977
00:51:28,136 --> 00:51:30,041
on

978
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:31,886
them. I've I've seen him. I
don't think I've seen them in

979
00:51:31,886 --> 00:51:33,731
real

980
00:51:33,731 --> 00:51:37,302
life, but I've seen them on
YouTube. If you want some,

981
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,722
Kirk: you know, on Spiderman or
they tell them, do a flip and

982
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,326
then he does the flip and then
it was like, oh, that's it. I

983
00:51:42,326 --> 00:51:43,930
want

984
00:51:43,931 --> 00:51:46,152
it to be on like, both ends of
that. I don't want to be the

985
00:51:46,152 --> 00:51:49,032
person saying, do the flip. And
then someone else does the flip.

986
00:51:49,331 --> 00:51:50,981
And someone says to me, I want
to be able to do the flip in

987
00:51:50,981 --> 00:51:52,631
that

988
00:51:52,632 --> 00:51:56,231
moment. But that's never
going to happen. You're

989
00:51:56,231 --> 00:51:59,172
terrified. What am I better at
than the two of you? This is, I

990
00:51:59,172 --> 00:51:59,831
gotta figure this

991
00:51:59,831 --> 00:52:08,952
Bekah: out. Kindness
documentation. Well, I don't

992
00:52:08,952 --> 00:52:12,882
know if Dan's better than you at
games or not. I like games. I'm

993
00:52:12,882 --> 00:52:13,692
very bad at them.

994
00:52:18,942 --> 00:52:21,431
Kirk: Not anymore. That's

995
00:52:21,911 --> 00:52:22,601
Bekah: have you seen the.

996
00:52:23,996 --> 00:52:26,951
Kirk: I would pay money. I
would, I would donate time and

997
00:52:26,951 --> 00:52:29,906
money to

998
00:52:29,907 --> 00:52:30,237
make that

999
00:52:32,246 --> 00:52:33,656
Bekah: Kurt, Kurt is Kirk day.
You were allowed to ask him to

1000
00:52:33,656 --> 00:52:35,066
do

1001
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:36,447
whatever you want right now.

1002
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:46,137
Dan: I don't know. I just, I'm
not very flexible at all that

1003
00:52:46,817 --> 00:52:47,757
it's a known fact.

1004
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:52,797
Bekah: Kirk poetry, maybe. I
don't know.

1005
00:52:53,396 --> 00:52:55,376
Kirk: Are you you're, you're a
poet. You poet.

1006
00:52:58,976 --> 00:53:02,697
Bekah: We have debt. We have all
three devils in the poetry. You

1007
00:53:02,697 --> 00:53:04,616
may be able to find all three of
our poetry online. If you

1008
00:53:04,616 --> 00:53:06,535
search,

1009
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:10,061
Kirk: I used to have a website.
The first website I ever made

1010
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,456
was

1011
00:53:11,456 --> 00:53:16,121
a WordPress site. It was called.
Shiver sharks. Cause that's a

1012
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:19,001
collective noun for sharks. And
I found out cause everyone does

1013
00:53:19,001 --> 00:53:21,882
like a pirate bowels or like
one-on-ones everyone knows. I'm

1014
00:53:21,882 --> 00:53:25,601
like, give me a weird shiver or
something like that. And then I

1015
00:53:25,601 --> 00:53:29,771
met the, I saw someone who had
the murder of crows and I was

1016
00:53:29,771 --> 00:53:38,351
like boring them about that. But
my websites, I don't want to

1017
00:53:38,351 --> 00:53:46,422
happen to it. WordPress is just
like, you don't do enough. And I

1018
00:53:46,422 --> 00:53:52,362
think I saved, I think I saved
everything from it as a RTF rich

1019
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:59,141
text. I'm like, this is great.
Lost that file. Worthless

1020
00:54:00,702 --> 00:54:03,161
unhelpful. This was before I
knew about mark down or

1021
00:54:03,161 --> 00:54:05,620
anything.

1022
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:06,371
Really?

1023
00:54:07,722 --> 00:54:08,112
Bekah: Yeah.

1024
00:54:10,646 --> 00:54:13,827
Kirk: Does anyone remember that
thing we used to use to make

1025
00:54:13,827 --> 00:54:19,376
websites? My professor in
university used it. It flips

1026
00:54:19,436 --> 00:54:20,817
no three waiver.

1027
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:26,456
Bekah: That was the first time I
ever coded was in Dreamweaver.

1028
00:54:26,487 --> 00:54:26,666
Yeah,

1029
00:54:29,336 --> 00:54:29,757
Dan: for sure.

1030
00:54:31,947 --> 00:54:34,677
Bekah: I want to do yoga with
the goat to Virtual Coffee

1031
00:54:34,677 --> 00:54:37,407
retreat at

1032
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:37,797
Glenn's

1033
00:54:37,797 --> 00:54:42,447
Kirk: house. I've seen the goat
yoga videos. And as somebody who

1034
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:46,257
like I see goats every day go
prove it. That's a real

1035
00:54:46,257 --> 00:54:49,362
Dan: thing. Yeah. It's the go-to
and yoga tour is to go just

1036
00:54:49,362 --> 00:54:52,467
like,

1037
00:54:54,327 --> 00:54:56,757
Kirk: and a bunch of little like
kid goats, just kind of like

1038
00:54:56,786 --> 00:54:59,666
amble about, and sometimes they
just climb you. Cause that's

1039
00:54:59,666 --> 00:55:00,717
their thing. Oh,

1040
00:55:00,717 --> 00:55:01,286
Dan: sure. I mean,

1041
00:55:01,556 --> 00:55:03,026
Bekah: yeah. Can we do a
fainting goats too? And then we

1042
00:55:03,026 --> 00:55:04,496
like jump

1043
00:55:04,496 --> 00:55:05,277
up and scare them.

1044
00:55:08,396 --> 00:55:10,916
Dan: Yeah, Nick, I use fibers.
Yeah, dreamer. So that's the

1045
00:55:10,916 --> 00:55:14,367
Macromedia suite, like
Dreamweaver fireworks, and then

1046
00:55:14,367 --> 00:55:17,936
like flash, if you do a flash
and, there was another one

1047
00:55:17,936 --> 00:55:19,466
that I didn't use very much,
like a more, designing one,

1048
00:55:19,466 --> 00:55:20,996
but,

1049
00:55:21,387 --> 00:55:22,857
yeah, I wasn't doing more
than farmers and like

1050
00:55:22,857 --> 00:55:24,327
Dreamweaver

1051
00:55:24,327 --> 00:55:26,381
was actually really good.
Even not using the like

1052
00:55:26,381 --> 00:55:28,435
generated

1053
00:55:28,436 --> 00:55:30,026
stuff, but it was a good like
code editor. Like I used it as

1054
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:31,616
my

1055
00:55:31,617 --> 00:55:34,856
like, just code editor for, I
dunno, I dunno when it stopped,

1056
00:55:34,887 --> 00:55:35,367
but like a long

1057
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:37,347
Bekah: time. Well, my first job
out of my first full-time job

1058
00:55:37,347 --> 00:55:39,327
out

1059
00:55:39,327 --> 00:55:41,786
of college, I was a community
organizer for an environmental

1060
00:55:41,786 --> 00:55:46,887
non-profit and the executive
director, my first week, he was

1061
00:55:46,887 --> 00:55:49,512
like, do you know. How to use,
how do you know a code? Like,

1062
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,137
no,

1063
00:55:52,706 --> 00:55:54,281
he's like, okay, go home this
weekend and learn HTML and CSS.

1064
00:55:54,281 --> 00:55:55,856
I

1065
00:55:55,867 --> 00:55:58,036
was like, okay, like Jesse was
my boyfriend at the time. And I

1066
00:55:58,036 --> 00:56:00,205
went

1067
00:56:00,206 --> 00:56:03,447
home and he had like textbooks
on HTML and CSS. So then we went

1068
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:05,967
over those things like, all
right, I know it. I know it now.

1069
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:10,476
Kirk: That's awesome. All
weekend. I'm pretty much an

1070
00:56:10,476 --> 00:56:11,347
expert. Nailed

1071
00:56:11,347 --> 00:56:11,436
Dan: it.

1072
00:56:13,146 --> 00:56:14,901
Kirk: Just to say, Jeff,
Jeff in the chat was like, do

1073
00:56:14,901 --> 00:56:16,656
pushups

1074
00:56:16,657 --> 00:56:19,072
on your fists or wristband
again, like we're just trading

1075
00:56:19,072 --> 00:56:21,487
problems

1076
00:56:21,487 --> 00:56:29,257
here. That's not, that's not
better. Yeah. Shout out to

1077
00:56:29,467 --> 00:56:32,077
that's a Dreamweaver. I remember
like a lot of purple. It was all

1078
00:56:32,077 --> 00:56:35,257
like purple involved with
somebody. Oh, I have a great bad

1079
00:56:35,257 --> 00:56:38,047
joke. I just heard it. This is
apparently very popular with the

1080
00:56:38,077 --> 00:56:44,067
first time I heard it. Bekah
don't ruin it. Which are

1081
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:50,757
Kirk's could apply to all Java
developers wear glasses.

1082
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:55,527
Dan: This is where you say, I
don't know why,

1083
00:57:00,777 --> 00:57:02,757
Kirk: because they can't see
sharp.

1084
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:08,306
Bekah: Nice. I was not
going in that direction. I was

1085
00:57:08,306 --> 00:57:08,847
going more with,

1086
00:57:09,117 --> 00:57:13,106
Kirk: if, if you were a software
developer in like 1998, that

1087
00:57:13,106 --> 00:57:17,487
would have been incredibly like
back when they were basically

1088
00:57:17,757 --> 00:57:22,706
Dan: C sharp in 1998. This is
like C plus plus in that, when

1089
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:23,967
did C-sharp become a thing.

1090
00:57:24,356 --> 00:57:29,547
Kirk: Okay. 2005. That's again,
back when

1091
00:57:31,697 --> 00:57:31,996
Bekah: what's that

1092
00:57:31,996 --> 00:57:36,077
Dan: 13, we don't need to talk
about how old I was, but, I

1093
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:38,536
wasn't, I was a computer science
in college, which was after that

1094
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:39,286
and.

1095
00:57:41,606 --> 00:57:42,177
Kirk: That's all the

1096
00:57:42,177 --> 00:57:46,556
Dan: validation, I suppose, does
not exist anymore.

1097
00:57:47,186 --> 00:57:55,077
Kirk: Yeah. People use it to
write. Whoa, whoa, buddy.

1098
00:57:55,387 --> 00:57:58,327
Dan: I don't know. I'm asking.
I'm not saying there's no

1099
00:57:58,327 --> 00:58:00,697
difference. I'm literally
asking, I don't know. C

1100
00:58:00,697 --> 00:58:02,572
Kirk: sharp is all.net, right?
It's all Microsoft, right?

1101
00:58:02,572 --> 00:58:04,447
That's

1102
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:08,586
this, if you're in Microsoft,
90% of the time you're writing C

1103
00:58:08,586 --> 00:58:15,067
sharp, and C plus plus is
not, C plus plus is still

1104
00:58:15,067 --> 00:58:18,652
considered like the Lang for
like high-performance stuff. If

1105
00:58:18,652 --> 00:58:22,237
you

1106
00:58:22,237 --> 00:58:27,606
don't want to get down to see, I
guess, but I feel like C plus

1107
00:58:27,606 --> 00:58:31,931
plus dad's favorite thing to do
is like, complain about. Yeah.

1108
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:32,621
Like JavaScript,

1109
00:58:33,461 --> 00:58:34,406
Dan: if you get to a certain
level, that's just going to be

1110
00:58:34,406 --> 00:58:35,351
an

1111
00:58:35,351 --> 00:58:37,871
Kirk: ally. If it's useful
enough, like there'll be enough

1112
00:58:37,871 --> 00:58:39,326
code written that it was like
something to complain about.

1113
00:58:39,326 --> 00:58:40,781
Like

1114
00:58:40,782 --> 00:58:43,407
Dan: Emily tells people, like
she was on a trip with her

1115
00:58:43,407 --> 00:58:46,032
grandma

1116
00:58:46,061 --> 00:58:49,092
and she's like, yeah, Dan hates
computers. And she knows that

1117
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,822
like, this is what I do for a
living, you know, but it's true.

1118
00:58:53,411 --> 00:58:55,692
You know, she didn't understand,
you know, she's like, what, what

1119
00:58:55,692 --> 00:58:59,081
does that mean? Yes. Like, yeah,
dad hates computers. Cause she

1120
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:01,961
told me a story. Cause I was
like, oh, yesterday I spent like

1121
00:59:01,961 --> 00:59:05,592
three hours trying to get, I
wasn't, I almost went over a

1122
00:59:05,592 --> 00:59:11,231
PG 13 again, Ruby to work
again on my computer. And it

1123
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:14,112
was really annoying and it like
killed my whole day, you know,

1124
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:18,041
anywhere else complained about
it at home and was like, I hate

1125
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:21,311
computers. I don't like them.
So, you know, well

1126
00:59:21,311 --> 00:59:22,961
Kirk: the first time I learned
Ruby, it was similar to that

1127
00:59:23,021 --> 00:59:28,121
Bekah situation. I was in
internship. Well, we can't any,

1128
00:59:28,181 --> 00:59:30,521
can't get any developers up in
this project. So you guys are

1129
00:59:30,521 --> 00:59:32,922
going to do it yourself and be
like, okay, any of, you know,

1130
00:59:32,922 --> 00:59:37,572
Ruby? No, this was back in the
time. They were like, here's the

1131
00:59:37,572 --> 00:59:41,382
instructions for how to install
this on your machine? If you get

1132
00:59:41,382 --> 00:59:45,822
it wrong, we'll would probably
break the machine. Good luck. So

1133
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:52,302
that's like, and it was super
painful. And I didn't like, look

1134
00:59:52,362 --> 00:59:54,657
at a line of Ruby again, what,
10 years. So, you know,

1135
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,952
onboarding.

1136
00:59:58,092 --> 01:00:00,552
Dan: Yeah, no, that's, it's
like, it doesn't matter every

1137
01:00:00,552 --> 01:00:03,012
time I

1138
01:00:03,012 --> 01:00:04,316
have to do something with her
and I just do it so infrequently

1139
01:00:04,316 --> 01:00:05,620
that

1140
01:00:05,621 --> 01:00:07,076
it's, you know, that's why it's
a problem for me, obviously, to

1141
01:00:07,076 --> 01:00:08,531
be

1142
01:00:08,532 --> 01:00:11,681
Kirk: fair. I feel like I do
Python stuff all the time and I

1143
01:00:11,681 --> 01:00:15,131
still mess it up. Like getting
it to work. I'm just, I just

1144
01:00:15,131 --> 01:00:18,581
want

1145
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:22,751
things to work. I just want to
click work and then they work.

1146
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:26,382
Yeah. Specifically the
installation and running part.

1147
01:00:27,311 --> 01:00:28,302
Bekah: That's the worst

1148
01:00:30,132 --> 01:00:33,731
Kirk: I got into Loreal. I'm
like, oh, I'm going to NPM

1149
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:38,981
installed new thing. And bam did
its thing. Do the thing run

1150
01:00:39,371 --> 01:00:43,061
didn't work. I Google the air,
you know, it's bad when you

1151
01:00:43,061 --> 01:00:46,452
search for an air and it takes
you to like, be official of like

1152
01:00:46,512 --> 01:00:50,411
issues on resolved page. Like,
oh no,

1153
01:00:52,211 --> 01:00:56,811
Dan: I can't. I was deep into
that yesterday. It doesn't

1154
01:00:56,811 --> 01:00:59,902
matter. Yeah. Anyway,
computers are doing that. I hate

1155
01:00:59,902 --> 01:01:00,112
them.

1156
01:01:00,592 --> 01:01:01,972
Bekah: Also. I have to go

1157
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:06,652
Dan: to leave at three, not
three 30.

1158
01:01:08,422 --> 01:01:08,931
Kirk: the week

1159
01:01:11,362 --> 01:01:13,312
Bekah: I have children, Bekah
needs to go clean up the Creek

1160
01:01:13,312 --> 01:01:15,262
in

1161
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:15,411
my.

1162
01:01:17,021 --> 01:01:19,181
Dan: She needs to go clean up
smokey

1163
01:01:19,181 --> 01:01:19,632
Kirk: bear

1164
01:01:20,472 --> 01:01:21,251
Bekah: birthday

1165
01:01:22,452 --> 01:01:30,702
Dan: week. Kirk, I just want
to say a happy Kirk day to us

1166
01:01:30,702 --> 01:01:31,001
all.

1167
01:01:31,722 --> 01:01:35,952
Bekah: We're glad to have you
thank you for joining us and the

1168
01:01:35,952 --> 01:01:36,641
entire world.

1169
01:01:37,331 --> 01:01:44,172
Kirk: I am. I'm happy to provide
me as a catalyst for the pool.

1170
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:48,282
People here, Kirk day is weird,
but the people who like it are

1171
01:01:48,282 --> 01:01:52,452
great on this,

1172
01:01:54,822 --> 01:01:58,302
Dan: we didn't plan any of this
at all. So I appreciate you. If

1173
01:01:58,302 --> 01:01:58,992
you know, Dan

1174
01:01:58,992 --> 01:02:00,822
Bekah: was like push to have an
agenda. And I was like,

1175
01:02:02,862 --> 01:02:05,172
Dan: we did get a lot of stuff
done today. It was

1176
01:02:05,512 --> 01:02:09,282
Bekah: a, but most importantly,
we saw Kirk on Kirk day and

1177
01:02:09,282 --> 01:02:10,481
changed our profile pictures.

1178
01:02:12,266 --> 01:02:16,786
Kirk: Nick Taylor's profile
picture is sideways. We noticed

1179
01:02:16,786 --> 01:02:17,097
that

1180
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:22,347
Bekah: it all makes sense,

1181
01:02:23,047 --> 01:02:23,666
Kirk: Don road.

1182
01:02:28,467 --> 01:02:29,876
Bekah: Well, that seems like a
great way to end.

1183
01:02:30,927 --> 01:02:32,967
Dan: That's a good one. Thank
you everybody for hanging out

1184
01:02:32,967 --> 01:02:35,007
and I'm

1185
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:37,947
happy, corrected and see you
Thursday.

1186
01:02:38,396 --> 01:02:49,376
Kirk: No, don't do another one
no more Kirk days. Yeah, every

1187
01:02:49,376 --> 01:02:57,806
single collective. It's fun. All
right, bye.
