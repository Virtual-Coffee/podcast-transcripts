00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:07,370
Dan Ott: Hello, and welcome to a
special Kirk Day Bonus Episode

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,559
of

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,528
the Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Dan. And this is a podcast that

4
00:00:15,528 --> 00:00:18,559
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,028
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:21,497
their coding

7
00:00:21,498 --> 00:00:25,368
journey. And they're here on
this podcast, usually, sharing

8
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:28,189
their stories and what they've
learned. Today, we had a little

9
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:31,428
bit of a different time. Bekah
actually came up to Cleveland

10
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:35,959
â€” where I work. And we
actually met in person for the

11
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:38,929
first time ever after knowing
each other for over three years.

12
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:42,859
And it was fun. And today is
also Kirk Day which you will

13
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:47,058
hear about a little bit later in
the episode. And also, Kirk

14
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:50,959
joined us as well, and it was
really fun. And it was a fun

15
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:52,008
little thing. We streamed it
live, we had some people sharing

16
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,057
in the

17
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:54,618
comments, and we thought we
would share it on the podcast

18
00:00:54,618 --> 00:00:56,148
stream as

19
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:00,649
well. So enjoy, and next week
we will get back to our regular

20
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:10,000
schedule. Hey, we were muted the
whole time [Bekah laughs].

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Bekah, why did you do it?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I was on my
phone [laughs].

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,316
Dan: I was just thinking in my
head, "Oh, I hope the sound

22
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:17,866
sounds good." And then, I- I

23
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:20,537
was like, "Huh?" I looked at the
mute thing and --

24
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:23,000
Bekah: Just so everybody knows,
I just did-

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,200
Dan: You did a great job.

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,700
Bekah: -the most amazing-

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,700
Dan: It was awesome.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Bekah: -intro that I've ever
done.

28
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,500
Dan: Yep.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Bekah: It's- it's suck
[chuckles].

27
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,300
Dan: It's really good. Yep.

28
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,000
Bekah: So here's my not so great
intro.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,300
Dan: We do.

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,156
Bekah: We are coming here, live

29
00:01:34,156 --> 00:01:37,816
from Lakewood, Ohio. We are
celebrating national Kirk Day or

30
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:40,757
international Kirk Day as we
more fondly know it at Virtual

31
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:41,236
Coffee.

32
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:42,337
Dan: Intergalactic Kirk Day?

33
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:47,147
Bekah: Intra galactic? Inter- I
was gonna say disciplinary. That

34
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:49,500
is not the right word.
Dimensional -- interdimensional

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,057
Kirk Day.

36
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:50,656
Dan: Yes.

35
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:53,027
Bekah: Because it is preserved
everywhere, because Kirk is

36
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:56,266
awesome and amazing, and we like
to celebrate Kirk as much as we

37
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:57,000
can.

38
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,000
Dan: Agreed.

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,186
Bekah: Dan, would you like to
introduce what international,

38
00:02:01,277 --> 00:02:03,917
dimensional, disciplinary Kirk
day is [chuckles]?

39
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:08,000
Dan: So, was it just a year
ago?

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,500
Bekah: It was a year ago, today.

41
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,727
Dan: Two years ago? Today? Yes,

40
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:16,300
Kirk had a tweet where he --
should I -- how should I read

41
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:16,500
the --

41
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,800
Bekah: You should. And put in
the announcement.

42
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,501
Dan: I feel like I should have
read the- the right text.

43
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:21,300
Bekah: Post it in the chat too. 

42
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,521
Dan: The- the- the -- this is
it, right?

43
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:24,700
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

44
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,500
Dan: Yeah. So, Kirk tweeted,
"Today we have achieved the

45
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,412
dream. My -- I

44
00:02:30,412 --> 00:02:32,801
made a function called Missy
Elliott that takes data

45
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:36,000
structure, flips it, and
reverses it. I have ascended."

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And then, very shortly after
that, Missy Elliott responded

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,700
[chuckles], replied on Twitter.
Actual Missy Elliott. Not- not a

48
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,000
fake Missy Elliott.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Bekah: The Missy Elliott. That's
--

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,592
Dan: And- and said something
like, yeah, she said, "Wow, I'm

49
00:02:50,592 --> 00:02:53,366
humbly -- I'm so humbly
grateful. Much love to y'all."

50
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:56,140
And that

51
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:59,981
was the beginning of a legend.
It was- it was really, really

52
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:03,700
awesome [laughs]. And everybody
saw it, and Kirk's, you know,

53
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:03,822
Twitter ...

53
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:10,000
well, let's see what the -- it-
it- it Kirk's tweet got a one

54
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,700
-- 13.3 thousand retweets
[laughs] and a hundred --

55
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,700
Bekah: A hundred and 70
[chuckles] -- 70 thousand like.

56
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,282
Dan: Yeah. And it's really
good stuff.

56
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:21,117
Bekah: It -- but not only that,
not only was it just YouTube,

57
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:26,300
but it expanded. So this was not
a one day event. It was-

58
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:26,700
Dan: Yeah.

59
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,000
Bekah: -it was on Twitter,

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
it was on LinkedIn, it was on
Reddit. Everybody loves Kirk.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,151
Dan: Yes. And we all are --
already loved Kirk. And this is

61
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:40,122
just a sort of celebration of-
of the rest of the world,

62
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:40,500
right?

63
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:40,700
Bekah: Yeah.

64
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,000
Dan: Be-becoming aware of- of
the Kirk.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,822
Bekah: So maybe we should tell
our Kirk origin story.

65
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:51,000
Dan: I think that's a great
idea [laughs]. Do you want me to

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
go first? Do you wanna go first?

67
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,300
Bekah: You go first.

68
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,122
Dan: Alright. I don't -- I mean,
I, like -- I don't have a

68
00:03:55,122 --> 00:03:56,967
specific -- I don't remember
the, like, moment, right? Of- of

69
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:58,812
meeting

70
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:03,056
Kirk. Cuz that was back in the
time of Virtual Coffee being --

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,500
Bekah: A tiny baby.

71
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,097
Dan: Yes. Very s- a little
smaller, you know? And so, we

72
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:15,700
had Slack, we had the coffees,
obviously. But -- and I'm not

74
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,000
a person who ... I don't know. I
don't know a lot of people

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,786
[laughs]. I don't really

76
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:23,307
-- like, people don't stick in
my brain until- until we, like,

77
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:27,357
interact. You know what I mean?
And so, my thing with Kirk was-

78
00:04:27,387 --> 00:04:29,786
was really the Hacktoberfest.
Was really, like, leading up

79
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:32,431
to Hacktoberfest that year. So
it was two years ago. And ...

81
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:38,997
Bekah and I, you know, we worked
together and I had known Sarah

82
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:42,700
because she was, you know, like,
she was already, like, helping

84
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,201
with Virtual Coffee and all that
stuff. And I could just

85
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,700
kinda wrote me in, right? For
Hacktoberfest to, like, help.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,300
Bekah: You -- okay.

87
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,000
Dan: And I was excited.

88
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,450
Bekah: To be fair, you were
like, "If you

88
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:54,641
need help with anything, let me
know."

89
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:56,000
Dan: I may have said that.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Bekah: So, if you offer to help,
you will [chuckles].

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,500
Dan:  It's true. Yes, most
people find that about -- out

93
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,700
about that eventually. But,
yeah. So, Kirk was there too,

94
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
right? And I have, like --

95
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,541
I, like -- you- you know,
I'd heard his name or whatever.

96
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,700
I, you know, we had been --

97
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Bekah: But he wasn't Kirk at
that point.

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Dan: He was still TK.

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,800
Bekah: He was still TK.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,300
Dan: That's right. He was just
the mysterious TK, which made

97
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,500
me, you know, want to know him
more, you know? Because, anyway,

98
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,300
that has a mysterious name, you
know? You need to-

100
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,500
Bekah: Mm-hmm. Yeah. You need to
know-

101
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,000
Dan: -know more --

102
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,000
Bekah: -more of the story.

100
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:29,831
Dan: And, yeah. And then that
-- so that -- it was like that

101
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,569
September leading up to that
October. It was a lot of

102
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:35,307
-- Kirk and I were

103
00:05:35,307 --> 00:05:37,976
-- I mean, I was working on
the site and that's when the

104
00:05:37,976 --> 00:05:40,000
first like this -- the current
version of the site happened,

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
you know? We made the leap with
like -- that which has brought

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,107
us the site

108
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:45,357
for Virtual Coffee where we're
doing all that stuff. And so, I

109
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:49,700
would be up in the middle of the
night [chuckles]. And Kirk was

110
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,000
usual- usually there too. And we
would like talk, and, you know,

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,700
throw ideas back

112
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,700
and forth, and think about
things. And then he was doing a

113
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,000
lot of the work on the ... I
dunno. More --

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,700
Bekah: Documentation part.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Dan: Yeah, social aspect of it,
the documentation, you know,

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,497
thinking about how, like, people
are going

117
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,976
to interact with Virtual Coffee,
and like how we need may-

118
00:06:08,307 --> 00:06:11,156
resources for maintainers, and
what those could look like, and

119
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:12,896
things like that. And so I
gained a lot of like -- both, it

120
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:14,636
was like fun to

121
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,947
hang out with him. And again,
a lot of, like, respect for

122
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:21,086
him, you know, at the same time.
So- so, yeah. And then after

123
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:23,906
that, it was just like, we're
just talking every day and had

124
00:06:24,237 --> 00:06:25,000
been doing that for-

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,300
Bekah: Ever?

126
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,526
Dan: -the last ... million
years? I don't -- it feels

125
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:29,500
like -- I don't- I don't know.

126
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Bekah: In all the dimension?

127
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,226
Dan: You know, in- in

126
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:35,000
multiple dimensions. I'd say,
if we're gonna use MCU, you

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,500
know, terminology though, Kirk
would be like a Nexus being,

128
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,700
right? So, there's only like,
one Kirk-

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,300
Bekah: Yes. Mm-hmm.

130
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Dan: -across the dimensions.
This --

131
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,000
Bekah: Yes.

130
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Dan: He's -- our Kirk [??]-

131
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:46,700
Bekah: Our Kirk [??].

131
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,500
Dan: -our Kirk [??] is prime
Kirk in there --

132
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:47,700
Bekah: All the Kirks.

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,700
Dan: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,300
Bekah: Yeah.

132
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,000
Dan: That's what I mean.
Yeah.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,300
Bekah: For sure.

134
00:06:50,300 --. 00:06:50,500
Dan: Yeah.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,076
Bekah: He's the right Kirk.

134
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,146
Dan: Exactly [laughs].

135
00:06:56,427 --> 00:07:01,400
Bekah: I will tell my Kirk
origin story. I don't remember

136
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:01,557
it

137
00:07:01,557 --> 00:07:05,637
exactly, but I have known Kirk
longer than most of the people

138
00:07:05,637 --> 00:07:08,500
I've known at Virtual Coffee.
But back when I knew Kirk, he

140
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,500
was like a -- maybe a python
image or a snake icon?

141
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,000
Dan: Oh, yeah, yeah.

142
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:14,700
Bekah: He was not-

143
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,000
Dan: Yeah. He --

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,991
Bekah: -I didn't know his face.
And then he started coming to

142
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,836
Virtual Coffee,

143
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:25,646
and I am really ... like,
nervous when I meet new people.

144
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:30,000
And then, I was like, "I think
this person knows me?" And I had

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,500
to try and figure it out [laughs].

146
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,206
And he would sit in this office,
like, with this

147
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:38,966
flag behind him, and everybody's
wearing masks back then when you

148
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:43,317
were on Zoom. And so I'm like,
"Who is this person that is

149
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:47,127
coming? I'm very nervous about
them." And then Kirk kept

150
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:50,000
showing up. I'm like, "Okay.
This is like, this- this person

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,500
might be my friend. I think
maybe we're moving into

152
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,566
friendship right now."

153
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:57,131
And then, when we were moving
into Hacktoberfest, I was

154
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:59,275
like, "Hmm."

155
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:04,700
I don't know who suggested it.
Somehow, Kirk ended up on the

157
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,766
Hacktoberfest team. And it was
me, Dan, Sarah, Bryan, and Kirk.

158
00:08:11,276 --> 00:08:15,000
And I feel like me, Sarah, Dan,
and Bryan were like,

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,500
"[Talks fast] Talk, talk,
talk, talk, talk."

160
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,187
And Kirk was like, "Why don't we
think about this for a second?"

161
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:26,000
[All laugh] Like, "Yes, we
shall -- probably should."

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Dan: Notorious [??].

163
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Bekah: So, Kirk was always doing
a great job of roping us all

162
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,300
back to having productive
conversations and making

163
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,797
progress on all the things that
we were

165
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:39,566
really excited about doing, and
making sure that they happen.

167
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:45,500
And -- like, for me, I like --
had not really either am heard

168
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,486
about documentation,

169
00:08:46,486 --> 00:08:49,697
like, talk about documentation
[laughs]. Put like, "What is

170
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:52,456
that thing?" And then, like,
Kirk was like, breaking it down.

171
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:54,826
This is why documentation is
important. And then, you know,

172
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:58,037
Kirk has a teaching background
too. And so it was like, "Okay,

173
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,256
this is starting to click a
little bit more for me." And to,

174
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:04,366
like, show how you can help more
people through the documentation

175
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:08,836
became something that was
like a change in my life, you

176
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:11,700
know? I will make no big deal,
but [laughs] --

177
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,300
Dan: No biggie.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,246
Bekah: [Laughs] That's all. So,
all right. I'm

178
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:19,067
gonna check out the chat now.
That's my- my Kirk origin story,

179
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:22,336
and this is how he's become to
be my best friend ever since.

180
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:27,047
Dan: Yeah. So we just got a
comment from David saying,

181
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:28,876
"So cool to see you in the same
place -- physical place." Yeah.

182
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:31,216
This is the first time that we
have, like, actually met in real

183
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:34,226
life. And we started working
together ... when did we start

184
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:34,700
working together?

184
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,496
Bekah: July -- this will be --
so, it would've been three years

186
00:09:37,496 --> 00:09:37,700
in July.

187
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,500
Dan: Yeah. Before -- I mean,
bef- before Virtual Coffee.

188
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,000
Like, we were working-

189
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,300
Bekah: Yeah.

187
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:43,700
Dan: -together before Virtual
Coffee started. And -- I mean --

188
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:44,700
Bekah: Dan fired me. And that's
how Virtual Coffee started

189
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:44,746
[laughs].

189
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:47,037
Dan: As soon as I said that, I
knew you were gonna say that. I

191
00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:49,500
did not ... fire ... Bekah.

192
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,700
Bekah: You did. My kids got sent
home from school, and then I

193
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,716
came home, and Dan was like,
"Sorry, you're fired. Good luck

194
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:55,000
[laughs]."

194
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,248
Dan: Listen. I mean, sometimes
you have to fire peep- people

195
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:03,760
[laughs]. I didn't fire you,
o-okay?

196
00:10:03,761 --> 00:10:07,201
You were a contractor, and so, I
just stopped paying you, and you

197
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:08,000
stopped doing work [laughs].

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Bekah: You're the worst
[laughs].

198
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,700
Dan: In my defense, I didn't
have any money to pay you with

199
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,000
[all laugh]. So --

200
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Bekah: It will get so --

199
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,756
Dan: I didn't have any work for
you to do.

200
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:18,491
Bekah: All right. Fine. Fine.
Fine.

201
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:21,700
I'll be fair. It was pandemic.
And there was no work.

202
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,500
So, [laughs] he fired me on
accident, apparently.

203
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,462
Dan: Yeah. Nick knew you're
gonna say that as well.

204
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:29,892
You're becoming predictable.

206
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:33,500
Bekah: [Laughs] But I feel like
we've had a lot of new members

207
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,500
that might not have known that
you fired me many times

208
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,001
ago [laughs].

208
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:45,432
Dan: So, anyway, yes. So, I
don't know about you,

209
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:50,500
Bekah. I spent a lot of time,
like, I'm like, "Okay. So, what

210
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,300
do I wear when

211
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,011
I meet a person for the first
time, that I've, like, worked

212
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:56,682
closely with for three years?"
Obviously, Virtual Coffee

213
00:10:56,682 --> 00:11:00,700
stuff. I -- Bekah w-wore the
t-shirt and the hoodie. I- I

214
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,741
just wear those --

214
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:02,412
Bekah: I understood the
assignment.

215
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,721
Dan: Yeah. Well, we didn't talk
about it ahead of

216
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:07,300
times. I almost, like, texted
you. I almost, like, I almost

217
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,000
asked you, and I should have.
Because then we could have just

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
been totally, you know?

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,152
Bekah: Oh, wait. Arjun joined
and wants to know who

219
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:14,532
fired me. Dan fired me [laughs].

220
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:20,300
Dan: No, I did not fire you [all
laugh]. I hate this. I'm

221
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,491
shutting this stream down.

222
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:24,131
Bekah: No, wait. Yeah,
[inaudible] [laughs].

222
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:27,731
So, okay. So maybe let's
go back a little bit so I can

223
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:31,182
tell the full story and give Dan
the credit that he is owned.

224
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:34,422
I'm a career changer. I spent 10
years teaching college English,

225
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:38,922
and I went to bootcamp. And when
I graduated, I put out a tweet

226
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:43,000
saying that I was looking for a
job. And Dan responded, and

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,500
hired me.

228
00:11:43,500 --. 00:11:46,000
Dan: [Inaudible]. Not really.

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,300
Bekah: Yeah.

227
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,300
Dan: Not really, but ...
seriously [laughs]. No, just

228
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:50,500
kidding [all laugh].

228
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:56,321
Bekah: So, I did not -- I
didn't take any coding tests or

229
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:58,960
have to

230
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:03,201
do any s-strange problems that
make no difference in the world.

231
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:08,542
And so, we worked together
until the pandemic hit and then

232
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:10,300
everything shut down. So-

233
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:10,500
Dan: Yeah.

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,500
Bekah: -so, Dan --

235
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,300
Dan: And I --

236
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,000
Bekah: I joked [laughs] --

233
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:16,131
Dan: As soon as I had work
coming back in, you had

234
00:12:16,131 --> 00:12:17,500
work coming back in too.

235
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:17,700
Bekah: Yeah.

236
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,500
Dan: Cuz you never ... say --

237
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,700
Bekah: He- he rehired me
[laughs].

238
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,211
Dan: Oh, okay, thank you. Thank
you [all laugh]. Well, yeah. It

236
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:27,700
was ru- it was a rough summer.
It was a weird summer.

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Bekah: That was really rough.
And that's how Virtual Coffee

238
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,991
started too. Because I was
getting assigned with

240
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:37,491
interviews with kids at home and
trying to figure out, like, what

241
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:42,700
life was like [chuckles]. And
then, I put out a tweet, "Does

242
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,371
anybody wanna

243
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:46,000
meet up for Virtual Coffee?" And
we just kept going with it. And-

244
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:50,000
and somewhere along the line, I
pulled Dan in too [chuckles].

245
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,300
Dan: Yeah.

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Bekah: Cuz he owed me for
firing me [laughs].

246
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,397
Dan: Oh, gosh [chuckles].
Alright. Alright.

247
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:05,096
So, here's the one thing. I'm-
I'm so used to, like, talking to

248
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:07,197
you on Zoom. We're sitting right
next to each other, but we have

249
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:11,547
the, like, Zoom monitor on the
screen. And so, I have been like

250
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:13,300
looking at -- I keep looking at
you on the screen instead of-

251
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,700
instead of, like, you next to
me.

252
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,000
Bekah: Yeah.

252
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,626
Dan: I don't even understand.

253
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:17,000
Bekah: Yeah. I'm not really
sure-

254
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,700
Dan: It's more the -- I don't
understand it.

255
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,700
Bekah: -how's the deal. Am I
suppose to look at you when I

256
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,346
talk to you?

254
00:13:19,346 --> 00:13:20,576
Dan: No. Right. Exactly. Yeah,
right. Do I look to camera? Do

255
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:21,806
you -- yeah. No,

256
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:25,677
it's weird. Good weird, but
it's- it's weird, you know?

257
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:26,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

258
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,700
Dan: [Inaudible]. Yeah.

257
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:31,091
Bekah: Yeah. Okay. Let's see.
Let me look at this chat.

258
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,700
[Laughs] Yes, Nick. Exactly.
"Dan responded, 'I'm looking for

259
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,500
someone to fire eventually.'"

261
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:38,700
Dan: It was really just the
power of truth.

262
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,700
Bekah: I was like, "Yeah. I am
totally-

263
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,700
Dan: Man. That's- that's -- all
of work -- all of our work are-

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Bekah: -here for being fired
eventually [laughs]."

265
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,500
Dan: -out of life. Yeah.

266
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,300
Just a power to fire somebody,
and then [inaudible].

262
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,051
Bekah: No, I had no coding
tests. We had a conversation. I

264
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:50,486
don't know if Dan remembers it,
but I remember --

265
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:55,500
Dan: I did. Yeah. I mean, I
didn't know what I was doing

266
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,000
either. It was -- I mean, this
is the first time I ever -- and

266
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,84
to be clear, like, you weren't

268
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:03,506
an employee, so, you know? I --
my whole thing was contractor,

269
00:14:03,506 --> 00:14:06,386
you know? Cuz I'm a contractor
too. But, yeah. I'd never done

271
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:08,576
that before. And like, I really
jumped into, like, very ADHD

272
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:15,500
style, like, no real plan, no
real, you know, guidelines for

273
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,500
myself or for anybody else or
anything like that. And it

274
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,125
worked out very well.

276
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,000
Bekah: It did! It worked out
really well.

276
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,267
Dan: But ... yeah, I dunno. It
was- it was- it was fun.

277
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:31,772
I'm -- I've been missing -- you
know, Bekah, you gotta ... I

278
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:32,000
dunno.

278
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,700
Bekah: I fired Dan.

279
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,300
Dan: I was gonna say-

280
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Bekah: And I got a new job
[laughs].

281
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,300
Dan: -you got a job. Yeah.

279
00:14:35,522 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah. So, you know, with, like,
insurance-

280
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,300
Bekah: Yeah.

280
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Dan: -I've heard is a good thing
to have.

281
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,322
Bekah: Insurance is nice. It's
useful.

282
00:14:44,322 --> 00:14:44,700
Dan: So, you know --

282
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:50,000
Bekah: Didn't have that for a
while [all chuckle]. So, yeah.

283
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,692
So, I've been working a new

283
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:55,892
full-time job, and Dan has
been --

284
00:14:57,361 --> 00:15:01,412
Dan: Yes. Ayu, thank you. If I
didn't fire you, there'll be no

285
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:04,500
Virtual Coffee. I didn't fire
you. God! I got tricked!

286
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Bekah: [Laughs] He did it.
Somebody-

287
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,000
Dan: Ooh, no.

288
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,700
Bekah: -please grab that.

289
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,000
Dan: No. We're shutting this
whole thing now.

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Bekah: Grab that from this
video-

291
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Dan: We're shutting it down.

292
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,000
Bekah: -so I can play it over
and over [laughs].

287
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:18,192
Dan: I blamed Melts, honestly,
for that- for that one. We went

288
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:21,700
to Melt in here, in Lakewood.
And there, it's -- I -- we

289
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,870
walked past -- the first

290
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:25,841
place I wanted to go, found out
close for lunch on the weekdays,

291
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:29,142
which I didn't know. But as
we were walking past Melt, I was

292
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:31,751
like, this place makes you wanna
go take a nap after, like,

293
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:32,000
after.

294
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

295
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Dan: And it's- it's true.

296
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Bekah: Can confirm.

294
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,642
Dan: Yeah. I mean, the two beers
probably- probably not bad

295
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:42,500
either. But, I blame -- yeah. I
blame- I blame that on that- on

297
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,000
that mental lapse. But I want to
stand firm that I did not fire

298
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,451
anybody.

299
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:49,991
Bekah: I mean, what is your
definition of fire, okay? He was

300
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:54,131
like, "I'm no longer going to
employ you or give you work or

301
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:58,000
money." So, anybody out there,
please let me know [laughs].

302
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Dan: Whatever.

302
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Bekah: So now, he's roped into
Virtual Coffee-

303
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,000
Dan: Oh, god.

304
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,961
Bekah: -forever [laughs].

303
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,300
Dan: Oh, man. Anyway, let's go
back to Ayu was saying that I

304
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,861
was right. And --

305
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:20,500
Bekah: I don't think that's what
Ayu said, okay [chuckles]?

304
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,300
Dan: Yeah, yeah. Well, that-
that everything that I did was

305
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:22,700
good.

306
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,000 
Bekah: She 100% did not say
that.

305
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,451
Dan: Yeah, no. I'm pretty sure
that's what she said. And --

306
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:26,700
Bekah: She did not!

307
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,000
Dan: No, I tried to scroll.
We can't- we can't scroll back.

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's -- we can't [chuckles]
--

307
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,341
Bekah: She's like, "Dan, it
sucks that you fired Bekah and

308
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:33,500
that was pretty awful. But at
least we got Virtual Coffee out

309
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,000
of it [laughs]."

310
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,500
Dan: We can't scroll back and
see what she says. [Inaudible].

310
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,000
Bekah: Nick tells, "Dan- Dan,
you can fire me any day [all

311
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,456
laugh]." I don't even know what
that means [laughs].

312
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,700
Dan: Ooh, Nick.

311
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,300
Bekah: Sometimes, I, like, very
frequently will spit out water

312
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,000
when I drink it. So I need to
try very hard to not drink and

313
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
laugh at the same time.

314
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,966
Dan: Hmm, wait. Who's ... yeah.
Somebody's episode. That was a

315
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:00,500
really good one of that.

316
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,366
Bekah: Oh, oh, it's Helen!

316
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:02,700
Dan: Oh yeah, Helen.

317
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,000
Bekah: Yeah.

318
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,766
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, I watched you
do it. I watched you swallow or,

317
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,287
like, you know, start to drink
water. And then Helen said

319
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:09,500
something hilarious, and, yeah.

320
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Bekah: I didn't mute myself.

321
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,300
Dan: I was like, "Oh, please."

322
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,000
Bekah: I was like choking for
five minutes [laughs].

321
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Dan: We -- yeah, Bekah and I
both have a- a problem with --

321
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,517
sometimes we, you know, you -- I
don't know if you could get this

322
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:23,876
in Zoom, where you ... you --
you're not, like, making eye

323
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,727
contact with a real person, you
know? But- but like, you almost

324
00:17:26,727 --> 00:17:26,500
can, like-

325
00:17:26,500 -->00:17:26,700
Bekah: Yeah.

326
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,500
Dan: -in Zoom, sometimes, you
know? Where, like, you know,

325
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,307
you're looking at

326
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:31,047
that person, you know they're
looking at you, you know?

328
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:34,000
And, yeah. We've had some- we've
had some meltdowns in the- in

329
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
the past [all laugh].

330
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,500
We try to keep it, you know,
it's all on the podcast. But

331
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,666
there's been some- there's been
some- there's been some moments.

332
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:44,700
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. There are
many moments on the podcast.

334
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,700
We've progressed so much. When
we first started the podcast, I

336
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,541
would laugh uncontrollably for
the first five minutes and I

338
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,700
could never do the introduction.
I -- maybe there's -- I don't

339
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,000
know if there's any [inaudible]
[laughs].

340
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:56,700
Dan: No, we have it all on tape,
for sure. We sure have it all

341
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,300
recorded. I don't know if --
yeah. I don't know how much

341
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:04,000
video we have of it, but, like,
we have a lot of views of- of

343
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,500
the, like, trying to do the
intros and stuff.

344
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,700
Bekah: [Laughs] I just couldn't.
I just would -- just --

345
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,000
Dan: It's so funny. Cuz you're
so good at it. Like,

346
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,500
you're so good at, like, this
stuff most of the time. And like

347
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,700
-- it's the recorded nature of
it. It's like the reading the

348
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,057
script part-

348
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:15,500
Bekah: It was like-

349
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,000
Dan: I felt that- I felt that --

350
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,700
Bekah: -I was so nervous.

351
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,000
Dan: Yeah. I feel like that was
[inaudible].

352
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,700
Bekah: Like, it [laughs]- it
was, like,

349
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:22,076
nervousness decided to turn
itself into laughters. And like,

350
00:18:22,076 --> 00:18:25,676
I could not stop. Which I guess
is, like, better than crying or

351
00:18:25,676 --> 00:18:29,067
sweating, which I have also gone
through those phases as well.

352
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:32,547
Dan: Yeah, sweat is definitely
one of my main skills.

353
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:36,000
Bekah: Just checking out the
chat.

354
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,300
Dan: Yeah.

355
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,231
Bekah: Promote it to customer
[all laugh].

354
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:47,700
Dan: Yes. Congratulations,
[inaudible]. Some -- I don't

355
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,392
know. Pressure valves?

355
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:52,300
Bekah: [Laughs] Yeah, Suze. He
probably would fire me for all

357
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:58,000
of this. It's okay. [Laughs] Oh,
am I sure I'm an introvert? I

358
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,922
dunno. I feel

358
00:18:58,922 --> 00:19:03,541
like maybe I'm an amvivert --
ambivert? I am, especially, like

359
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,862
intensely nervous, and shy, and
exhausted when I'm around people

360
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:10,700
that I don't know. But like,
when I'm around people that I

361
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,612
know or

361
00:19:11,612 --> 00:19:15,700
people that I'm friends with,
then I can often, like, find

363
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,241
that energy I think that
extroverts have.

364
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:24,692
Dan: For- for me, it's -- for
me, it's sort of knowing exactly

365
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:26,700
what, like, I was supposed to
do-

366
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,000
Bekah: Yeah.

367
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,500
Dan: -in a situation. That's
what I'm comfortable,

366
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,922
right? And so, like, the -- this
is just you and me

367
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,261
chatting, you know? And like,
we've practiced this, obviously.

368
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:36,192
So it's like, you know, talking,
like --

369
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:38,500
Bekah: We didn't practice this.
But like, we've been [laughs] --

370
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,916
Dan: Well, I -- no. Can't you
tell? We did, like- we did, like

371
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,061
[laughs], this is -- yeah,

372
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:46,872
very polished, you know, thing.
No. But what I mean is

374
00:19:46,872 --> 00:19:51,500
like, I know what socially
is expected of me in this

375
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,210
situation.

376
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:56,471
You know what I mean? And so, if
I'm in coffee, like, one of our

377
00:19:56,471 --> 00:20:00,402
coffee chats, and in a room with
a whole bunch of people I don't

378
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:02,832
know, I'm not, like, I don't
have a problem. Like, I don't- I

379
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:08,300
don't get, like, awkward like
that. But- but when I go to,

380
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,490
like, go to a

381
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:12,162
conference, right? And then,
there's like a social hour or

382
00:20:12,162 --> 00:20:15,162
lunch or whatever, and I don't
know people, and I don't know

383
00:20:15,162 --> 00:20:18,192
exactly what I'm supposed to do
or, like, my role in, you know,

384
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:18,500
that's when I get, like-

385
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:18,700
Bekah: Yeah.

386
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,000
Dan: -that's when I get, like,
super-

385
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,200
Bekah: Yep.

386
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,832
Dan: -and I just go and

385
00:20:20,832 --> 00:20:22,662
sit down by myself, and put my
headphones on or so- or -- I

386
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:24,820
don't put my headphones on. But
like -- cuz I'm fine if somebody

388
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:25,856
comes [chuckles] and talks to
me, like, that's cool.

389
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:26,000
Bekah: Yeah.

390
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,891
Dan: Cuz that's like,

390
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:29,000
"Hey, this is what you're
supposed to do now," you know?

392
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But like, walking up to somebody
and trying to, like ... that's-

394
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,300
that's what I -- like, I really
struggled with that. That-

395
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:35,500
Bekah: Yeah.

396
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,700
Dan: -that's the kind of stuff
that I struggled with,

395
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:42,500
you know? Is those- those, like,
situations ... where it's an

396
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,112
unfamiliar territory or like ...
you know? I dunno.

398
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:46,000
Bekah: Yeah.

399
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Dan: Something like that. So --

400
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,311
Bekah: My dad was just telling
my-

401
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:48,551
Dan: Super [inaudible].

399
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:51,500
Bekah: -oldest â€” my 12-year-old.
He was talking about how great

400
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,500
it is to talk to, like, random
people, and to go up and talking

401
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,142
to them, like, "Dad, that is-
that is

402
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,511
a terrible thing." My dad loves
it. Like, he will go up to any

403
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:01,541
person, and he will probably try
and say what their na- he'll

404
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,031
ask them their name and hope
continually try and repeat that

405
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,551
throughout the conversation, but
then forget their name and use a

406
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:08,000
different name that's wrong
[laughs].

407
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,000
Dan: [Laughs] That's awesome.

408
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Bekah: He tries very hard to be
personal.

407
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,000
Dan: Yeah.

407
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,700
Bekah: But there's, like, my
worst nightmare talking to a-

408
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,000
Dan: Yeah.

408
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:18,000
Bekah: -stranger that I don't
know about things.

409
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,000
Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

410
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,500
Bekah: I can't.

411
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,500
Dan: Yeah. No, my father-in-law
is huge -- he big on that. And

410
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:22,961
he was a bartender

411
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:25,571
and stuff. And like, he just
doesn't naturally -- like, he

412
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:29,382
does it almost like impulsively,
you know? But like- like, in

413
00:21:29,382 --> 00:21:32,172
an elevator or something, he'll
just like chat up, and they

414
00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:34,000
probably don't wanna talk to
him. Well, I mean, like -- not

415
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,741
like -- he's not being creepy or
anything.

416
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:36,000
Bekah: Right.

417
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,942
Dan: And he's not, like, hitting
on anybody or anything like

417
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:39,281
that. But he would just like ...
talking to them.

418
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:40,000
Bekah: He would be friends with
my- my dad [laughs].

419
00:21:40,000 --. 00:21:40,700
Dan: [Laughs] Right, right.
Yeah.

420
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,791
Bekah: They would talk to each
other in the elevator.

419
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:43,700
Dan: [Inaudible]. He's, like,
great guy. You know what I mean?

420
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,000
And like, but that's just how he
is, you know? And ... yeah.

420
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,000
Somebody said something about --
Joe said some- "What do I do

422
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,300
with my hands?" That's a big
thing with me too. And honestly,

424
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,701
that's like -- what I -- one of
the things I like

425
00:21:57,701 --> 00:22:01,000
about the -- this- this phase in
our, like, collective lives of

426
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,700
the Zoom stuff is that most
times -- so right now, my

427
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,651
camera's like scooted back a
little bit so that we can both

428
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:17,500
fit in. Most time, you can't see

429
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:10,700
my hands. And I've, honestly,
like, during this thing, I had

430
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,300
been, like, seeing my hands in
the video, and been like, "Oh,

431
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,811
god. Get these out of here," you
know? Cuz I'm just like- like, I

432
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:17,936
don't know. What do I do with my
hands? Big problem. Yeah. What

434
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:23,300
do I do with my whole body?
Like, standing in a group of

435
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,300
people. How do I stand? You
know? Like [chuckles],

436
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,000
seriously, like, I -- I've --

437
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,300
Bekah: Yeah.

438
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,700
Dan: -I've struggled with that,
you know?

436
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,076
Like, I don't -- do I just put
my hands in my pockets

437
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:31,977
or, you know? I dunno.

438
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,000
Bekah: That's why I like
pockets.

439
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,000
Dan: Yeah, yeah.

439
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,616
Bekah: And they just don't make
enough pockets for women.

440
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:35,000
Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

439
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Bekah: It's like, even earlier-

440
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,000
Dan: Pockets is -- are great.

441
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Bekah: -I -- we're -- Dan and I
were like sitting

440
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,247
at this conference table talking
-- like, I move around a lot,

441
00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:43,000
and I've, like, recently, become
more aware-

442
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,300
Dan: Mm-hmm.

443
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,416
Bekah: -of how much I move by

442
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:48,297
seeing other people on camera.
And then I'm like constant- I

443
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:50,247
think someone once gave me like
feedback, "Don't move your hands

444
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:53,000
so much. It's distracting."
Like, whatever. Like, I'm gonna

445
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,300
move my hands as much as I want
it. Like, because I can. I said,

446
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,700
I -- we've got spinny -- Dan's
got spinny chair. So I got to do

447
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,300
a lot of spinning [chuckles].
This is- this is what I do. I

449
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,700
move all the time. But, like-

450
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,700
Dan: Yeah. You do it a lot too.

451
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,907
Bekah: -when I'm in front of the
camera in my office,

450
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:12,300
like, I very much try -- I- I
have to try very hard to sit

451
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,000
still [chuckles]-

452
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,300
Dan: Yeah.

453
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Bekah: -and not move my hands
everywhere because that is not

452
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,757
my natural state of being.

453
00:23:17,757 --> 00:23:19,500
Dan: It's hard. [Bekah chuckles]
It's hard.

453
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,497
Waving your hair -- ha-hands in
the air. Yes. Joe said --

454
00:23:26,497 --> 00:23:28,500
Bekah: We did the wave one time
at Virtual Coffee-

455
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,000
Dan: Ooh, right.

456
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,700
Bekah: -in my breakout room. We,
like, alf- we- we alphabetized

455
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,000
everybody, and then everybody
went. It was very exciting.

457
00:23:39,997 --> 00:23:43,000
Dan: Do we miss -- oh, no. Oh,
Marie had to go.

458
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,300
Bekah: Oh, Marie.

459
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,000
Dan: We will see you, Marie.
Yeah. I dunno.

458
00:23:49,017 --> 00:23:53,000
Bekah: We should -- is- is
Kirk around? Can we bring Kirk

459
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,307
on?

460
00:23:54,326 --> 00:24:00,000
Dan: I don't know. It is Kirk
Day.

461
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,606
Bekah: Which is why we started.

461
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:06,000
Dan: He responded to [inaudible]
well, that was 20 minutes ago,

462
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I guess. Are you DM him? Or
should I DM him?

463
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,700
Bekah: I DMed him.

464
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,000
Dan: Okay. We'll see if we can
get Kirk on here.

463
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,395
Bekah: Our celebrity. Our
resident celebrity.

465
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:20,027
Dan: It'll be funny. Because
once we get another person on

466
00:24:20,027 --> 00:24:24,000
this call, you and me, we'll be
in one box. And Kirk will be in

467
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
another one [laughs].

468
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,300
Bekah: Yeah.

469
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,700
Dan: Oh, man. It's- it's crazy.
It's crazy.

467
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,342
Bekah: Kirk is at work. What's
work? Can people do that?

469
00:24:32,662 --> 00:24:37,192
Dan: Don't they know it's Kirk
Day? I'm pretty sure they do.

470
00:24:37,192 --> 00:24:39,000
Because they is --

471
00:24:38,342 --> 00:24:40,981
Bekah: Oh, I mean, maybe we
can have any Kirk. Nick has

472
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:41,500
asked. That's a good question.

473
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,000
Dan: Ooh.

474
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Bekah: So, in our Slack right
now, most of us have put our

474
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,082
profile down, flipped it, and
reversed it. But with Kirk's --

476
00:24:50,082 --> 00:24:52,000
Dan: Huh. I see him. Kiirk.

477
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Bekah: Kiirk.

478
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,000
Dan: Alright, alright. Hang on
there a second. I'll

479
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,500
[inaudible]. Alright. We're
gonna try to get Kirk in to

480
00:24:59,500 --> 00:24:59,700
join --

481
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,700
Bekah: We're doing out best. If
we disappoint you-

477
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,500
Dan: I just have- I just have to
remember how, you know, work

478
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,000
this [inaudible].

479
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,402
Bekah: -we're sorry. We're doing
our best

478
00:25:06,402 --> 00:25:08,000
to bring our celebrity on the
stream.

479
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Dan: Him is celebrity.

479
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,612
Bekah: At least take -- 10 fakes
in- in the

480
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:14,800
chat as well. I wanna shoutout
to Abbey Perini because she

482
00:25:14,801 --> 00:25:18,000
DMed me last night. She was
like, "After midnight, put up

483
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,700
this in your profile." So, Abbey
has been an amazing observer of

485
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,000
Kirk Day, and I could not have
asked for anything better.

486
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,300
Dan: Oh, breakout rooms. I don't
think we need breakout rooms.

487
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,500
Bekah: We don't want breakout
[inaudible] [all chuckle] --

486
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,700
where are we breaking out to?

487
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Dan: I was trying to turn off the
[inaudible].

487
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,700
Bekah: Will the real slim Kirk
please stand up? Yes. Oh, my

488
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,300
goodness. We definitely need to
find more ways to put Kirk into

489
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:42,686
music.

490
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:46,586
Dan: All right. Kirk said, he
can join in three minutes. So-

491
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:46,800
Bekah: Should we-

492
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
Dan: -we have -- we --
[unintelligible].

493
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,500
Bekah: -tell jokes? Tell joke.
Joke.

494
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,700
Dan: I don't -- I'm not -- we
just talk about for --

492
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,586
before. I don't know jokes. I
can't remember them.

494
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:56,457
Bekah: All right. I'll tell my
joke. Have you all [laughs]

495
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:57,146
[inaudible] about pizza?

496
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:00,936
Dan: Nope. I haven't heard that
one.

497
00:26:03,817 --> 00:26:05,616
Bekah: [Laughs] Nevermind. It's
too cheesy for pizza.

498
00:26:09,717 --> 00:26:10,106
Dan: Oh, man.

499
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:14,517
Bekah: When we do the podcast,
Dan always wants me to adjust my

500
00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:18,000
microphone. And so then, I try
and tell him jokes, which he

501
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,537
ignores

502
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:22,676
all of the time. And then some
of our guests are nice enough to

503
00:26:22,676 --> 00:26:25,700
laugh. So, if you come on the
podcast, please laugh at my

505
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,000
jokes and roll your eyes at Dan.

506
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Dan: Don't encourage her.

507
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,000
Bekah: Please encourage me
[laughs]. In my keynote-

508
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,300
Dan: You know --

507
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:36,000
Bekah: -talk that I'm giving in
July, I'm just telling jokes for

509
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,606
15 minutes straight because I
can do whatever I want.

510
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:41,817
Dan: That'll -- that's true.
You're the keynote speaker. So,

511
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:44,000
that'll be your first and only
time being a keynote speaker

512
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,500
[all laugh].

513
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,000
Bekah: But is it worth it?

514
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,076
Dan: Oh, Joe said I should fire
you again -- wait! I did

512
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:51,300
not fire you [Bekah laughs]. I
reject the promise. I reject it!

513
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,257
God, they keep trying to trick
me!

513
00:26:55,257 --> 00:27:01,500
Bekah: Can't fire me anymore
[laughs]. All right. But if

514
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,227
anybody else

515
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:05,500
has jokes, please put them in
the chat and then I will deliver

516
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:05,700
them because I'm-

517
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,500
Dan: You know what?

518
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,300
Bekah: -very good at it.

518
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:10,000
Dan: She needs to deliver them
because you are the worst joke

519
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,166
receiver in

519
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:13,146
the world. You know what she
does? Yeah. You know you do,

520
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:15,700
when you -- when I asked you
jo- when I've like, I have --

522
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,000
there's been times where I've,
like, pulled out some jokes.

523
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Bekah: Oh, yeah?

523
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,500
Dan: Yeah. Because I know that
you appreciate them-

524
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:21,700
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

524
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,311
Dan: -but she try -- she guesses
the answers. She like -- she

525
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,216
didn't say, "I don't know.
What?" She, like,

526
00:27:27,936 --> 00:27:31,000
tries to, like, it's a riddle.
[Laughs] You are, right? Like --

527
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Bekah: Isn't that how everybody
do it?

527
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,000
Dan: No. No. No-

528
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,700
Bekah: So, something [??]-

529
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,300
Dan: -it's not.

530
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,700
Bekah: -"Oh no, Dan. I don't
know. Can you tell me the

528
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,000
answer [laughs]?"

529
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:43,700
Dan: No, that's not what -- what
are you doing? You're fired

530
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,000
[laughs].

531
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,297
Bekah: [Laughs] Again?

531
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:51,000
Dan: Not again. For the first
time I have fired you [Bekah

532
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
laughs]. [Sighs] Man.

532
00:27:53,557 --> 00:27:56,257
Bekah: See? Exactly. Thank you,
Joe. Joe knows. It's not a joke.

533
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,366
It's a challenge. Every joke is
the challenge.

534
00:27:59,297 --> 00:28:02,477
Dan: That's not a -- mm-mm.
That is not a joke.

535
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:05,777
Bekah: Well, but a joke then is
like a story that you tell with

536
00:28:05,777 --> 00:28:08,700
a punchline at the end, in- in
your sense of a joke is.

537
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,000
Dan: I mean, you're- you're,
like, stand up here? You're

538
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
[all laugh] --

539
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Bekah: Yeah. Isn't that what
everybody aspires to?

540
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:20,656
Dan: Oh, wait. Kirk here. Okay.
Well, according to Kirk, one

538
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:23,300
minute left. So, yeah. We'll
see.

539
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,500
Bekah: One minute. T-minus one
minute.

540
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,700
Dan: Oh, Kirk was not consulted
at all for any of this. That is

539
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:32,500
true. I try not to consult Kirk
at a time on things where --

541
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:33,136
Bekah: We'd-

542
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,700
Dan: He- he- he --

543
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,300
Bekah: -somebody be reasonable
[laughs].

542
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:39,500
Dan: Yeah [laughs]. Yeah, right,
exactly. Or, you know, where he

543
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,365
might have time to

544
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:44,000
think about whether he wants to
engage with us. We try to- try

545
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
to pull him in, you know, before
he has a chance to, you know?

546
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,221
Bekah: Yeah, no. We --

547
00:28:48,221 --> 00:28:50,000
Dan: Avoid my ridiculousness.

548
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,300
Bekah: Joe, yes. We do need a
scoreboard. Maybe that will be

549
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,700
next month monthly challenge --

550
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,300
Dan: Alright. So far it counts
as one.

551
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,872
Bekah: 97 and counting.

550
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:05,231
Dan: [Chuckles] Oh, god. How did
I not see that coming? Honestly.

551
00:29:05,741 --> 00:29:08,442
Bekah: I don't know. I didn't
even think about it. And so we

552
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:10,000
started talking and you brought
it up.

553
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Dan: I don't think it was me.

554
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,000
Bekah: Yes. A Slack channel-

555
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,700
Dan: Yeah, definitely.

553
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,352
Bekah: -or a Slack bot that
posts every time that Dan fires

554
00:29:20,352 --> 00:29:20,500
me.

554
00:29:20,352 --> 00:29:24,001
Dan: Hmm. How about a Slack
button that just announces that

555
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:24,571
Bekah is fired again?

556
00:29:25,922 --> 00:29:26,200
Bekah: Everybody-

557
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,000
Dan: That- that- that I'm- that
I'm-

558
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,500
Bekah: -just continuously fires
me over and over [Dan laughs].

557
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,653
It's okay. Just keep firing me.
It's fine.

558
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,000
Dan: Hm.

559
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Bekah: Kirk just preparing to be
up here. Yeah, he probably --

559
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,300
sorry, Kirk, we're sorry that
you have to prepare for us

561
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:41,500
[laughs].

562
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,000
Kirk: Yeah.

563
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,500
Bekah: We were trying to send a
drone that would just go scoop

563
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,000
up Kirk-

564
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,000
Dan: Oh, how we gonna do this?

565
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,067
Bekah: -and bring him to
Cleveland.

564
00:29:47,817 --> 00:29:51,686
Dan: Well, maybe Zoom will cut
out the echo. I was just

565
00:29:51,686 --> 00:29:51,500
thinking-

566
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:51,700
Bekah: Oh.

567
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,000
Dan: -I would have headphones.
And then I was -- I don't know

566
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,700
how to do that, really. We're
just gonna try it. And I'm gonna

568
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,300
count on you guys to tell us
if there's a bad echo. Cuz I'm

570
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,000
just gonna play it over the
speakers. And because Zoom is

572
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
actually -- usually pretty good
at that. Like-

573
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,500
Bekah: One headphone in your ear
and one headphone in my ear.

574
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,000
Dan: I mean, if that's all we
have to do, I -- you know, we

573
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,300
can do AirPods or something. But
like, that'll be annoying. I

574
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:23,000
have -- I'm trying to think if
there's any other ... solution.

575
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,500
But literally, this is the first
time I've ever sat next to

576
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,000
somebody-

577
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,700
Bekah: Okay. So, I -- here's --

578
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,047
Dan: -and- and try to be on- be
on, you know, camera.

577
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:35,000
Bekah: I mean, if I have my
computer, I can-

578
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,500
Dan: Yeah.

579
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,300
Bekah: -put on my AirPods and --

579
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,727
Dan: I mean, like, you can go on
the other fucking room and do

580
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:38,936
that, like --

580
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,146
oh, sorry. I did not mean to
curse, but she made me have two

581
00:30:42,146 --> 00:30:47,366
beers. And she, you know, she
forced me to do it. And -- which

583
00:30:47,366 --> 00:30:49,196
I've been meaning to talk to HR
about, and they said you're

584
00:30:49,196 --> 00:30:52,500
fired, so ... [all laugh]. I
would --

585
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Bekah: Fired again [laughs].

586
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Dan: The reason I swore was
because, like,

585
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,700
you going out somewhere else
sounds not fun is my point.

586
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,300
Bekah: I meant-

587
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,000
Dan: I would be sad about that.

588
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,300
Bekah: -just have my computer,
and log on, and I would sit

587
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,000
here-

588
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,800
Dan: Hm. I feel like you- I feel
like you ended up getting a --

589
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,477
Bekah: -but just so I could put
the sound in my ear.

588
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:08,000
Dan: I feel like you'd get a
delay, plus you'd hear me

590
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
through there too. And through
here too [laughs], you know?

591
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,300
Bekah: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

592
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,500
Dan: So, we're gonna try it with
[inaudible].

591
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:21,000
Bekah: Do they have, like,
covers for your AirPods that

592
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,796
you're sharing them for someone
else? Like, you know how, like,

593
00:31:22,796 --> 00:31:23,000
they-

594
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Dan: Oh, yeah. We couldn't --

594
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:25,000
Bekah: -have like the tongue
depressor-

595
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,500
Dan: My airp- yeah, yeah.

595
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,000
Bekah: -and they cover it? Or
like the ear thing, they put a

596
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,747
little thing? Do they have one
of those for your AirPods?

597
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:35,500
Dan: The -- oh, yeah. That's --
as soon as I thought- thought of

598
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,317
that, that's where, like, my

599
00:31:37,317 --> 00:31:39,000
AirPods are, like, gross right
now. Like, I wouldn't wanna

600
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
share that with anybody. So that
would be an embarrassing thing

601
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,566
to do as well [Bekah laughs].

602
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:50,156
There has to be some sort of
like ... I dunno. I feel

603
00:31:50,156 --> 00:31:52,000
like back in the day, they used
to have a lot of cool things of

605
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,076
where you'd split the, you know?
I probably, honestly have --

606
00:31:55,076 --> 00:31:56,700
Bekah: Did they have lots of
cool things?

606
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,355
Dan: Yeah. Where they'd have

607
00:31:57,356 --> 00:32:00,057
a little splitter. So you have
your iPod and the cord with the

608
00:32:00,057 --> 00:32:02,000
two things, and then you could-
could sit-

609
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Bekah: Oh, I didn't have an
iPod. 

609
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,707 
Dan: -in those cars. You could
sit next to your friend in the

609
00:32:04,707 --> 00:32:06,700
-- or in the bus or the car and
both just do the same thing.

610
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:06,911
Bekah: What?

610
00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:08,000
Dan: Yeah.

611
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,700
Bekah: I said --

611
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,000
Dan: But those were recorded,
you know? They were like --

612
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Bekah: Old people?

612
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Dan: No. Fo-for like cool kids
in high school that listened to

613
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,700
cool music and had cool friends.

614
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,900
Bekah: I was not a cool kid with
cool friends in high school

615
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,000
[laughs].

616
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Dan: Alright. I didn't have it
either, so ... it just seemed

617
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,382
cool [all laugh].

618
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,300
Kirk Shillingford: What?
[Inaudible].

614
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,300
Bekah: Can watch the other cool
kids. Ooh, Kirk is talking. It's

615
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,000
said up there.

616
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,500
Dan: Oh, oh.

617
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,000
Bekah: Where is he?

618
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Dan: Kirk, are you here?

616
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Kirk:  I mean, I can see you.

617
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Dan: Hey! There you are
[laughs].

618
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,000
Bekah: Kirk!

619
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,500
Kirk: I want you to know, like
--

617
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,000
Bekah: [Laughs] I just shouted.

618
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,700
Dan: It's Kirk!

618
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:43,500
Kirk: I, like, feel watching the
stream while I was getting ready.

620
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,500
And then, there was a moment
where I'm like, "This is --

622
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,000
there's a lot of going on here.
I don't know- I don't know where

623
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,500
I fit in. I don't have any
jokes. And I don't have, like,

624
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,000
any jokes [inaudible] rule
formats." So --

625
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Bekah: But you're the best. So
--

625
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,500
Kirk: You know? Bekah, I- I
feel like, what do you think are

626
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,000
jokes and not what other
[inaudible] [laughs].

627
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,000
Bekah: [All laugh] Oh, no!

626
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,000
Kirk: I just feel like you've
taken, like, stand-up and

627
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,500
competition, and you, like, flip
them together instead that is

628
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,500
all of jokes [all laugh].
[Inaudible]. There's more than

629
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,000
jokes.

627
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Dan: Oh, Kirk. I'm so glad
you're here.

628
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,000
Kirk: I just --

629
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,326
Dan: I think that's -- that was
decades ago. I know it was

629
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:33,626
decades ago because it was high
school. Thank you for putting

630
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:35,000
that out there. I appreciate
that.

631
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Kirk: Decades?

632
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,500
Dan: Oh, god.

633
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,000
Bekah: Let's start.

634
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Dan: All right. Everybody else
has said there's no audio

631
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
issues.

632
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,500
Bekah: Yay!

633
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,916
Dan: We are good.

632
00:33:44,277 --> 00:33:47,000
Bekah: We did it. We got the
celebrity of the year here.

633
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,896
Welcome. It's been a great year.

634
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,000
Dan: The- the celebrity of
multiverse [chuckles].

635
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:51,700
Bekah: Yeah.

635
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,346
Kirk: I did -- this entire day,
I've just been seeing threads

637
00:33:55,346 --> 00:33:58,000
ongoing. I don't remember
talking though. No.

638
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,700
Dan: [Laughs] Yeah. I was --
I've been having the opposite

639
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,576
problem where I r- I read as

639
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:05,467
reading through a thread and was
like, "Oh, who wrote that? Oh,

640
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:06,000
that was me." Like, it's [all
laugh] --

641
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,700
Bekah: Dan said, "I think we're
at lunches [laughs]."

642
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:08,876
[Inaudible].

642
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:15,000
Kirk: It's -- this is ... again,
I just wanna make the record

643
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,500
clear that I was not consulted
about any of this. I woke up,

644
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,186
I saw it, I just assumed Slack
wasn't working.

646
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Dan: [Dan and Bekah laugh] Yeah,
it does that- it does that --

645
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:26,156
Bekah: Nick Taylor, like,
somebody would -- maybe read out

646
00:34:26,156 --> 00:34:27,566
was like,

647
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,746
"I'm seeing pictures of Kirk."
And Nick is like, "It happens

648
00:34:30,746 --> 00:34:32,000
sometimes." And it does. Like,
sometimes-

649
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,300
Dan: It does happen.

650
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,700
Bekah: -Slack put other-

651
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,000
Kirk: Yeah.

649
00:34:33,777 --> 00:34:34,737
Bekah: -people's pictures.

650
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,976
Dan: Not upside down usually
though.

651
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:39,700
Bekah: No. And flipped it
[inaudible] and reversed it.

652
00:34:39,896 --> 00:34:42,567
Kirk: Okay. So I'm gonna be
clear. I was very dense. It

653
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:45,700
took me way too long to figure
out that's what that was. Again,

654
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm just -- I thought Slack was
not working. And then I thought

656
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,567
it was like,

655
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:54,597
"Okay. Let's add one way for
Kirk to distinguish himself

656
00:34:54,597 --> 00:34:57,597
from other people." But it
wasn't even about me. Which I

657
00:34:57,597 --> 00:34:58,000
feel like it's the --

657
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Bekah: It's all about you. Every
part of it is.

658
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Kirk: Kirk Day is about ...
everyone. It's a- it's a VC

659
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,847
event. I'm just-

660
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,500
Bekah: It's about-

661
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,000
Kirk: -just this small --

662
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,626
Bekah: -celebrating how much we
love Kirk.

663
00:35:09,626 --> 00:35:10,500
Dan: Yep. It's true.

661
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,000
Kirk: No.

662
00:35:12,356 --> 00:35:14,876
Bekah: We're lucky that Missy
Elliott responded to you. So we

663
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:18,507
can remember every day -- it's
like Valentine's day. Because

664
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:20,500
some people don't like
Valentine's day, cuz they're

665
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,027
like, "What is this? It's

665
00:35:21,027 --> 00:35:25,500
a commercial holiday to sell us
chocolate, and flowers, and cars."

666
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,700
And -- but, it's also a day to,
like, remind you to stop

667
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:33,000
and think like, "Oh, I'm going
to tell this person that I

668
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,700
love them today," right? And so,
like, we often forget to tell

670
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,000
you every single day that we
love you, Kirk. So this is our

671
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Kirk Valentine's Day slash Missy
Elliot Day.

672
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Dan: We do love you, Kirk.

673
00:35:46,000 -->00:35:47,000
Bekah: We love you.

673
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,000
Kirk: Ah, see? I wasn't prepared
for this either. Go back to

674
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
these jokes [Bekah and Dan
laugh]. No, I don't wanna any --

675
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,700
I didn't sign up for any real
emotions here.

674
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,586
Dan: Kirk, Kirk, since it's Kirk
Day, do you wanna fire Bekah

675
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:56,000
too?

675
00:35:56,786 --> 00:35:57,000
Kirk: No.

676
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,500
Dan: [Laughs] Alright.

677
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,000
Kirk: I mean-

676
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,500
Bekah: Thank you.

677
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,300
Dan: Alright.

678
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:00,700
Bekah: Thank you.

677
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,637
Kirk: -I feel like [inaudible]
I have to be the one person who

676
00:36:05,637 --> 00:36:06,416
doesn't fire you.

677
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,000
Dan: Alright. I guess it's --

678
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,700
Bekah: How many people do you
think have fired me?

679
00:36:10,947 --> 00:36:13,677
Kirk: I mean, just based on the
chat response, people seem to be

680
00:36:13,677 --> 00:36:18,700
really into you being fired.
Like, as much as like Kirk Day,

681
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,700
like, on their tier list of
events, Kirk Day, Bekah being

682
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,000
fired, that's what the people
want.

683
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:29,700
Bekah: The people want me to be
fired [Bekah and Dan laugh]?

684
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,000
Kirk: I dunno.

685
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Bekah: I don't even know what to
do. I'm gonna have to, like,

684
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
think about this very hard on my
two and a half hour drive home.

685
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,927
Why everybody wants me to be
fired?

686
00:36:40,677 --> 00:36:44,000
Kirk: Well, you seem to be like
really enthused about it, to be

687
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,500
honest. Cuz you're the one who
brings it up. Dan doesn't bring

688
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:47,700
it up.

688
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,367
Bekah: No. I'm just shaming him.

689
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:52,000
Kirk: It's like your origin
story.

690
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,626
Bekah: It is- it is my origin
story [Dan and Bekah chuckle].

691
00:36:58,407 --> 00:37:01,467
Kirk: Not teaching, not the
women who code, like, it's

692
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:06,000
all started when Dan fired me.
And then the passion live inside.

693
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,000
Bekah: Listen, my --

694
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,700
Kirk: The second time it
happened, less [??] fire.

693
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Bekah: My other origin story is
not a -- it's- it's not --

695
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:15,000
it's rated PG-13.

696
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Dan: What?

697
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Bekah: Why I got into coding?

696
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:26,500
Kirk: Oh, why did I get into
coding? I didn't -- I was have

697
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:26,657
to --

697
00:37:26,657 --> 00:37:28,500
Bekah: I mean, I can tell that
one, but then people always feel

698
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,500
awkward. Cuz, like, when someone
asks you how you got into coding

699
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,500
and you use the word vagina,
they're suddenly like, all weird

700
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:34,800
about it.

701
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,000
Dan: Is that what gets you
PG-13? I don't know [inaudible].

702
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,700
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. I don't
think you can say that in a PG

701
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,097
movie [chuckles].

702
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,300
Dan: Really?

703
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,300
Kirk: I --

704
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:42,500
Dan: I don't know.

702
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:46,000
Bekah: You can drop one f-bomb
in a PG-13 movie. So we're saw

703
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,500
a PG-13 here. We're good.

704
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:47,700
Dan: Boom.

705
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,407
Bekah: Dan, watch yourself.

704
00:37:50,456 --> 00:37:52,000
Dan: What's gonna happen
[chuckles]?

705
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,700
Kirk: So, why would you really
throw it all to Dan?

706
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,000
Bekah: Because he already
dropped one-

707
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,500
Dan: That's true.

708
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,000
Bekah: -today.

709
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,200
Kirk: Oh.

710
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,700
Bekah: He dropped one and only.

711
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,000
Dan: Yeah.

707
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,106
Bekah: He was like, "I'm gonna
be the one that gets to drop

708
00:38:01,106 --> 00:38:01,300
it."

708
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,000
Dan: It's -- cuz I was worried
about you leaving.

709
00:38:04,706 --> 00:38:06,700
Kirk: Okay. Yeah. No. You're
in Dan's house now. So you get,

710
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,500
like, what's-

711
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,000
Dan: It's not my house.

712
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,000
Kirk: -where's the body?

711
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,500
Dan: It is my office. It's
office.

712
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:11,700
Kirk: Oh.

713
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,451
Bekah: It is an office.

712
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:14,846
Dan: Yeah. It's actually
Sprockets'

713
00:38:14,936 --> 00:38:17,966
office, which is who I do most
of the work through. But I have

715
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:21,700
my own, like ... well, I don't
know this stuff. You know, I

717
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,817
have my own room that is my
office in the [inaudible].

718
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,500
Kirk: I interpreted everything-

719
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,700
Dan: What do you call that words
of room? What's the word for-

720
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,500
Kirk: -you've said as
[inaudible] house-

721
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,000
Dan: -that? Like, I have like --

722
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,000
Kirk: -in a tree.

719
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,166
Dan: There is -- there's a suite
of offices.

720
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:31,300
Bekah: Yes.

721
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:32,927
Dan: And I have --

720
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:33,700
Bekah: It's got its own little
pod.

721
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,300
Dan: I have one of them.

721
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,916
Bekah: There's a conference room
and a couple of offices.

722
00:38:37,487 --> 00:38:38,687
Kirk: I believe that you are
both in a tree house. I don't

724
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:41,297
believe anything you say.

725
00:38:41,297 --> 00:38:42,226
Bekah: I would like to be in a
tree house.

726
00:38:42,226 --> 00:38:47,700
Dan: That would be cool. Emily
and I went two weeks -- last

727
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,987
week? When was I gone?

728
00:38:48,987 --> 00:38:50,500
I dunno. Two weeks ago, whatever
it was-

729
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,000
Bekah: Oh, yeah.

730
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,700
Dan: -to Amish country and got a
tree house like Airbnb-

731
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,326
Bekah: Oh, nice.

730
00:38:54,326 --> 00:38:57,515
Dan: -it's like a newly built
thing that was, like, well way

731
00:38:57,516 --> 00:39:00,000
raised up in the trees and
stuff. It was really cool. Yeah.

733
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,646
Highly recommend.

734
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:05,697
Bekah: Gemma and I drove through
Amish country recently on

736
00:39:05,697 --> 00:39:07,500
accident cuz I made a wrong
turn.

738
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,500
Dan: Oh, yeah. That's always-
that's always a great adventure.

738
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Bekah: And we went for shopping.
And I- I got some large plastic

739
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,806
bins for $3 each.

739
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:14,967
Kirk: Amish plastic bins?

740
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:17,637
Bekah: No. But there were $3
[chuckles].

741
00:39:17,637 --> 00:39:20,097
Dan: One thing I learned, this
trip, lots of Amish people now

742
00:39:20,126 --> 00:39:23,786
are into e-bikes, which was a
surprise to me. But it was cool.

743
00:39:23,786 --> 00:39:25,000
Bekah: Ooh. I don't think I see
an e-bike.

743
00:39:24,266 --> 00:39:26,500
Dan: And it made sense once I
thought about it. So, like lots

744
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,700
of -- and it was honestly, there
was a couple of men, mostly a

745
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,000
lot of women, riding around on
the country highways. I mean the

746
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,500
same highways

747
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,706
that the- the buggies are riding
on, but like -- but they're just

748
00:39:37,706 --> 00:39:40,376
like -- and they usually had a
little bike trailer, you know?

749
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:44,300
But they're just like flying
down. I went on an el- on an

750
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:44,831
electric bike. It's cool.

751
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:45,300
Bekah: Mm. Interesting.

752
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:45,500
Dan: Yeah.

750
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,911
Kirk: Fun fact. Early in the
history of bikes,

752
00:39:49,061 --> 00:39:52,751
there was like a massive upsurge
in popularity with women

753
00:39:53,112 --> 00:39:55,811
because it gave them like assets
to travel and, like, see their

754
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:59,411
friends without having to, like,
go through their husbands. And

756
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:02,172
so, there was like a big, like,
reactionary thing so that

757
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:04,000
people -- they were, like,
published articles about, like,

758
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
the bicycle. Is it ruining your
woman [laughs] to get them stay

758
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,700
home again? Is that how that
goes?

760
00:40:13,322 --> 00:40:16,700
I just- I just imagine some
like do just like, "Argh! These

761
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,541
bicycles. They're hanging out
with their friends!"

763
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:21,500
Bekah: I don't ride a bicycle.

764
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,500
Dan: What?

765
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Bekah: I don't ride bicycles.

766
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,500
Kirk: You can't or you don't?

767
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Dan: You don't know how? Or you
can't?

765
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:27,700
Bekah: Well, both.

766
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,811
Dan: You don't know how to ride
a bike?

766
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:31,632
Bekah: Well, I- I did. But
then I fell off it too many

767
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:33,000
times. So I stopped.

768
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,300
Dan: [Inaudible].

769
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Kirk: So, you did know how to
ride a bike.

770
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,500
Bekah: I don't know. I mean, do
you know how if you keep falling

769
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,000
off? I had a bunch of stitches
in my elbow. See? There's still

770
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
scar there. I don't think you
can see that on screen.

772
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,700
Dan: I can see it. It's there.

773
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,000
Bekah: Thank you. Thanks for
confirming.

774
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,700
Dan: It's very tiny.

775
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,000
Bekah: It was larger, okay. For
a long time [laughs].

776
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Kirk: Not a contest.

772
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,356
Bekah: I once ran into a pole
while riding on a bicycle.

773
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,700
I don't ride bicycles.

774
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,000
Kirk: [Inaudible], but the story
--

775
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,500
Dan: [Inaudible].

773
00:41:02,097 --> 00:41:03,000
Bekah: I was on a flat path.

774
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,300
Dan: Yeah.

775
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,700
Kirk: I can relate [inaudible].

774
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Dan: I mean, there's like, I
think -- I feel like you know

775
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,000
how. You're just not good at it.
And that's fine. I mean, like,

777
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,686
you -- you're allowed to be not
good at things, you know? But

778
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:14,000
you know how to ride a bike.
That's my point.

779
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,000
Bekah: You're saying I'm not
good at riding bike?

780
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,867
Dan: Yep. Challenge- challenge
thrown down [chuckles].

781
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:20,000
Bekah: I just don't know how
[chuckles].

781
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,237
Kirk: Wait. Can you swim?

782
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:23,277
Bekah: I'm a great swimmer.

783
00:41:23,907 --> 00:41:26,000
Kirk: Okay. I'm just trying to
figure out, like, on -- in a

784
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,217
triathlon, like-

785
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:26,400
Dan: Whoa.

786
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,000
Bekah: I was a lifeguard for
like 10 years of my life.

787
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Dan: She used- she used to,
like, very well out there, Kirk.

784
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,700
Kirk: -where are you struggling?

785
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Bekah: I taught children how to
swim. I taught swim team.

785
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,067
Kirk: So it's like swimming,
running, cycling.

786
00:41:39,027 --> 00:41:40,500
Bekah: Mm, yes. Uh-huh. Yeah.

787
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,000
Kirk: Fair.

788
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,476
Bekah: That's it. I don't know.
I probably would

787
00:41:42,476 --> 00:41:45,356
not ride a skateboard. I tried
to do that with my child's

788
00:41:45,356 --> 00:41:47,291
skateboard, and I was like,
"This is gonna break my hip."

789
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:49,900
Dan: It's gonna [inaudible].
Yeah. I was just worried about

790
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,000
my [inaudible] --

791
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Bekah: No sled riding. I- I once
almost broke my hip sled riding.

792
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,300
I had to go to the emergency
room. It wasn't broken, but gave

793
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,000
me lifelong problems.

794
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,000
Kirk: That's a lot.

795
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,000
Bekah: When I was- I was on a
mattress. I sled rode on a

794
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,500
mattress. That was a bad idea.

795
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,300
Dan: So you were sledding, so
much as mattress riding?

796
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Bekah: Well, so --

797
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,700
Dan: That's a little different.

795
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,300
Bekah: I was, like, not good at
sled riding. And so then these

796
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:08,700
boys in college-

797
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,700
Kirk: Okay. I'm in a --

797
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,500
Bekah: -they were like, "Hey,
let's take this mattress and

798
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,000
we'll go-

799
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,500
Kirk: I mean --

798
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,000
Bekah: -on it. And you'll land
on the mattress and it's soft."

799
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,500
Dan: Land?

800
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,700
Bekah: And that makes sense.

801
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,500
Kirk: I'm gonna take pause here.

799
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:19,500
Bekah: Well, okay. So there was
a ramp-

800
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,000
Dan: Yeah! Alright. There's -- I
knew there's more of the story.

801
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,700
Bekah: -but I was like, "Don't
go over the ramp. They promised

800
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,146
they wouldn't go over the ramp
and you know what-

802
00:42:24,146 --> 00:42:24,300
Kirk: It does --

803
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,907
Bekah: -happened? Everybody
ditched the mattress except me

803
00:42:26,907 --> 00:42:30,000
and one other guy. And he landed
on top of me and he was 200

804
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
pounds. I landed on my hip on
the snow.

805
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,700
Dan: That is not sound good.

806
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,700
Bekah: It was not good.

805
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,000
Kirk: Your story started with,
"I'm not good at sled riding."

806
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,336
But as far as

806
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:41,456
I'm aware -- now, remember where
I live. So, I'm admittedly

807
00:42:41,456 --> 00:42:45,327
ignorant of these things. But
aren't you just -- isn't it

808
00:42:45,327 --> 00:42:47,277
just like physics happening to
you?

809
00:42:47,277 --> 00:42:47,400
Dan: Yeah.

810
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,300
Kirk: Like, how [inaudible] --

809
00:42:48,027 --> 00:42:50,300
Dan: It's mostly the ramp that
was a problem. I feel like

810
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:50,597
for --

811
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:50,700
Bekah: Well-

812
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,500
Dan: The slide riding-

813
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,000
Bekah: -that was- that was my
second slide riding accident.

814
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,000
Dan: -is easiest thing. You just
put [inaudible]. Alright, Kirk.

811
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,800
You totally right though. You
just like sit on the sled and

812
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,000
then-

813
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Kirk: Let the [inaudible], you
know?

814
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,000
Dan: -let go out the hill. Yeah.

812
00:42:59,097 --> 00:43:59,700
Bekah: No! Sometimes, like, you
wreck into things on sleds-

813
00:43:59,700 --> 00:43:01,700
Dan: So, I feel like the-

814
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,500
Bekah: -and bikes.

815
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,000
Dan: -important part about sled
riding is picking your spot.

814
00:43:06,387 --> 00:43:09,356
Cuz if you go where there's like
huge ramps or like â€” I don't

815
00:43:09,356 --> 00:43:11,300
know where else you crashed â€”
but like, trees and stuff, you

816
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:11,500
know-

816
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,500
Bekah: Trees. It was a tree.

817
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,700
Dan: -probably not a good idea.

818
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,700
Bekah: I hit a tree a couple of
times [chuckles].

816
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,700
Dan: Yeah, yeah. Well, slides
are hard to stee- like, they

817
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,137
don't-

818
00:43:16,137 --> 00:43:16,300
Bekah: Yeah.

819
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,300
Dan: -they don't s- they don't
-- they're not gonna, like, do

818
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,000
a sharp turn steer, you know?

819
00:43:20,217 --> 00:43:22,500
Bekah: I remastered my fear
though. My brother moved-

820
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:22,800
Dan: Sled is fun.

820
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,000
Bekah: -down the street and has
a great sled riding hill. And I

821
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,867
have gone down that hill
multiple times.

822
00:43:28,047 --> 00:43:31,000
Dan: Yeah. You- you see? You can
affect like s- like slow gradual

824
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,300
turns on sleds. You know what I
mean? But like --

825
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,000
Bekah: I just [inaudible]
straight down.

826
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,300
Dan: What -- I mean, I'm saying,
you can turn slowly while-

826
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:38,500
Bekah: Yeah.

827
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,700
Dan: you're going fast, straight
down.

828
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,500
Bekah: I was [inaudible] in the
ground.

826
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,000
Dan: But you have to plan it
ahead [laughs]. You have to plan

827
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,700
it ahead or just ditch it, is
what I would -- what I do when I

829
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,237
wanna control.

830
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,300
Bekah: Not gonna say [??].

831
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:45,700
Dan: Yeah.

832
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,500
Kirk: Now in the chat --

833
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,500
Bekah: Jeff is correct. He says
I lift heavy things and I put

834
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,000
them down.

831
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:50,242
Dan: Yeah. Somebody said we
should do a challenge, a bike

832
00:43:50,242 --> 00:43:52,500
ride challenge. But it [Bekah
laughs] would be [inaudible]

833
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,000
I can actually-

834
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,700
Kirk: Well, [inaudible] --

835
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,000
Dan: -I can sit- sit on a bike,
and not move, and not fall over.

835
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,086
Bekah: Dan has a nickname for
his bike riding.

836
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,000
Dan: Yeah.

837
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,000
Bekah: Yeah [Bekah and Dan
chuckle].

836
00:44:01,617 --> 00:44:05,500
Dan: Yeah. It's Hotshot. Yeah,
somebody named -- I got-

837
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,000
Kirk: [Inaudible].

837
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,000
Dan: -a nickname in- in high
school. It- it originally from

838
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,926
bike riding, but ... that was
[Bekah and Dan chuckle] I don't

839
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,500
know what all that stuff was,
but --

840
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,500
Bekah: Oh. Poop emojis?

841
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,700
Dan: Oh, nice. Yeah. Bekah's-
Bekah's daughters sent me a poop

840
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:23,291
emoji drawings because every
time they come on the thing, and

841
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:25,500
they always want, you know,
whatever they're waving and

842
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,581
stuff. And so I just started
sending poop emojis and they

843
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,021
thought of [inaudible]. So --

844
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:31,000
Kirk: Well, I've always --
that's been very validating to

845
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
me with, like, Bekah's family
associates me with, like,

846
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
pancakes and hot sauce. And,
like, Dan gets poop emojis

847
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
[chuckles].

848
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,000
Bekah: So I'd-

849
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,300
Dan: [Inaudible].

850
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,000
Bekah: -I don't think anybody
knows this story.

851
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,700
Dan: I'm alright with that.

849
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,000
Bekah: The one morning, a couple
of weeks ago, we were making

850
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
pancakes and my daughters
decided they were gonna make

851
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,500
pan-Kirks [chuckles], some
pancakes that looked like Kirk.

852
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,700
And then they argued over who
would eat the pan-Kirk. But

853
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,000
then, it -- we only had a little
bit of butter left. So there was

854
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,300
only one pan-Kirk and it looked
like a tiny baby. So, I think

855
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,300
Gemma ate baby pan-Kirk
[laughs]. Kirk is like this very

856
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,202
strange [laughs] --

857
00:45:08,202 --> 00:45:10,000
Kirk: She sent me this, like,
"Look! They made, like,

858
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,700
pan-Kirks." There's nothing
special about the pancakes

859
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,000
itself [Bekah laughs]. It's just
a small pancake. There's no

859
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,700
distinguishing. There's no,
like, chocolate chip face.

860
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,700
It's just a pancake.

860
00:45:22,811 --> 00:45:24,702
Bekah: We did our best with what
we had, okay [laughs]?

861
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Dan: Oh, man.

861
00:45:28,302 --> 00:45:30,000
Kirk: Well, your best is bad.
Don't tell them. I was very

862
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,222
[chuckles] -- it's very
heartwarming, but also quite

862
00:45:33,222 --> 00:45:36,492
strange. I only know how to
make pancakes from scratch, not

863
00:45:36,492 --> 00:45:39,851
the mix. And the, like,
proportions I learned it at are

864
00:45:39,851 --> 00:45:42,641
the only way I can do it. So I
can only make like enough

865
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:46,500
pancakes, like, a full family.
But my family quickly-

866
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,000
Dan: [Inaudible].

866
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,700
Kirk: -like, [inaudible] they
don't want pancakes. So I would

867
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,052
just eat, like, two pounds of
pancakes myself. Cuz I know --

869
00:45:53,052 --> 00:45:54,000
Bekah: You can freeze them- 

870
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Dan: Yeah. You- you --

871
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Bekah: -and then pop them in the
toaster.

870
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,032
Dan: Yep. It's true. They're
good that way.

871
00:45:58,961 --> 00:46:00,700
Kirk: Or I could eat two pounds
of pancakes.

872
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,211
Dan: Right.

873
00:46:01,211 --> 00:46:03,000
Bekah: Yeah. That's [inaudible]
[laughs].

874
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,700
Dan: So you're not [inaudible].
You're just bragging at this

873
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,442
point, is you get to eat two
pounds of pancakes.

874
00:46:05,442 --> 00:46:08,202
Kirk: And then I go up to them
like, "You made me do this."

875
00:46:08,202 --> 00:46:11,700
[Dan laughs] That's the spirit.

875
00:46:11,981 --> 00:46:16,331
Dan: I -- so we were talking --
I mean, we wanted to hang out in

876
00:46:16,331 --> 00:46:18,552
the stream or whatever, and just
hang out with people. We talked

877
00:46:18,552 --> 00:46:21,311
about doing a podcast. Like,
making this like a live podcast

878
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:26,442
episode. I realized that we
didn't do a random question or

879
00:46:26,442 --> 00:46:28,500
anything like that. So I was-

880
00:46:28,500 --. 00:46:28,700
Kirk: Wait --

881
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,700
Dan: -just -- I don't have a
plan for this. I was thinking if

880
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,040
I had [chuckles] somebody has a
-- has- has a good, you know,

882
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,862
random question -- or Kirk, if
you --

883
00:46:35,862 --> 00:46:36,500
Kirk: Well, in VC today-

884
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,700
Dan: Or- or a riddle, really,
[inaudible] Bekah.

885
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,700
Kirk: -[inaudible] sort of like
fake icebreaker was which part

884
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,210
of -- not

885
00:46:43,211 --> 00:46:46,092
which part of your body hurts.
Cuz the answer can be multiple.

886
00:46:46,331 --> 00:46:49,500
Well, like, which is the one
you've noticed hurting, like,

887
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,500
most, recently [chuckles]. Cuz
somehow we just all started

888
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,000
talking about the parts of our
body with, like, creaks.

889
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,000
Bekah: My traps [chuckles]. My
traps hurt [chuckles].

890
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,376
Dan: Which ones are your traps?

891
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Bekah: Here, back here.

892
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,000
Dan: Oh, okay.

893
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,700
Bekah: I have built up too much
muscle, and now it's very tight.

894
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,500
Dan: I have that problems too.

892
00:47:10,257 --> 00:47:11,700
Bekah: And it hurts every day
[laughs].

893
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,500
Kirk: You have that problem too,
right, Dan? You just way too

894
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,817
much muscle.

893
00:47:14,817 --> 00:47:17,700
Dan: I didn't do many trapezoid
exercises. So --

894
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Kirk: Yeah. When I was a kid in
school-

895
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,500
Dan: I just --

895
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,500
Kirk: -I did all the triangle
workouts. I saw [inaudible] --

896
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,167
Dan: You know, I get in the gym
and I think tri- geometry I'm

897
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:26,000
like, "Yo, those trapezoids --"

898
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:26,700
Kirk: Boom.

899
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,500
Bekah: What about your- what
about your [inaudible]

900
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,000
trapezoids [chuckles]?

898
00:47:25,617 --> 00:47:31,000
Dan: [Inaudible] trapezoids
[inaudible].

899
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,700
Kirk: [Inaudible].

900
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,300
Dan: And you gotta get the- the
whole, the acute-

901
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:35,700
Bekah: Quadercept squad.

899
00:47:35,336 --> 00:47:37,601
Dan: -and the obtuse -- the
acute and the obtuse triangles.

900
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:41,500
And then make sure you hit the
-- oh, sh-

901
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,500
Bekah: Squares [laughs].

902
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,000
Dan: Is it -- no. What's the-
what's the per- is perfect

902
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,036
triangle -- well, no. What's
the ... equal lateral. E-equal

903
00:47:47,036 --> 00:47:50,000
lateral- equal lateral triangle
as well. Make sure you hit all

905
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,500
three of those. If you wanna do-

906
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:51,700
Kirk: Yeah.

907
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,700
Dan: -a full workout, then you
get into the 3D and you get some

906
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,700 
cubes. And, you know, you get
some ... other hydron things --

908
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,000
oh, man. This is where I
[inaudible].

909
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Kirk: This man is clearly --

910
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,907
Dan: I almost said it [laughs].

909
00:48:02,907 --> 00:48:06,387
Kirk: And sports is what we're
saying. I think someone in the

910
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:10,286
Slack was like, "Who could lift
more weight?" Like, "Who could,

911
00:48:10,286 --> 00:48:12,717
like, deadlift more?" I'm like,
"It's- it's definitely Bekah."

912
00:48:12,746 --> 00:48:15,500
Dan: A deadlift- a deadlift --
Bekah would very easily -- I

913
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,000
mean, most of these probably she
would anyway, but like a- a

914
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,700
deadlift, any of the ones where
you need a form -- we need form

915
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:21,327
and stuff, like-

916
00:48:21,327 --> 00:48:22,300
Kirk: That's all of them.

917
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,416
Dan: -the proper form -- I'm
saying, I would just kill

916
00:48:24,416 --> 00:48:26,051
myself. Like, I would like -- my
back would throw [inaudible] or

917
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:30,000
something. You know what I mean?
I have [inaudible] literally

918
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,500
never works out. Like, I'm
fairly strong, but Bekah works

919
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,700
out all the time and it is very
strong. I feel like a- I feel

921
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,000
like a bench press is where I-

922
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,300
Bekah: Yeah.

922
00:48:37,853 --> 00:48:41,700
Dan: -like, I feel like a bench
press, I probably could equal

923
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,000
her.

924
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,300
Kirk: Okay.

925
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,000
Dan: I dunno- I don't-

926
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,700
Bekah: Oh, you for sure could
... kill me.

924
00:48:43,101 --> 00:48:46,371
Dan: -think you were -- but like
-- be- because with bench press,

925
00:48:46,371 --> 00:48:48,000
I don't have to worry about
hurting myself very badly

926
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
[chuckles] cuz my back is
supported.

927
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,500
Kirk: You could just sit. I
mean, I've seen --

926
00:48:49,641 --> 00:48:51,700
Dan: You know what I mean?
[Laughs] Then it's just like --

927
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:55,500
and then it's ... you know? But
like, any of the ones that like

927
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,300
requires skill? I mean, she's-

928
00:48:58,461 --> 00:49:00,000
Bekah: Jesse and I talked about
it last night.

929
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,700
Dan: -she's killing it.
[Inaudible].

929
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,481
Bekah: I was like, "I think Dan
could crush me in bench

930
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,000
pressing."

930
00:49:02,911 --> 00:49:04,000
Dan: I'm- I'm I'm sup- I'm like-

931
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,700
Bekah: He was on board for that.

932
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,500
Dan: -supposedly strong for
somebody who doesn't ever work

933
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:06,700
out.

931
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,700
Kirk: What I wanna know is who
wins in cycling. I think you

932
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,882
could have an edge there.

933
00:49:11,722 --> 00:49:12,300
Bekah: Oh, for sure.

934
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:12,500
Dan: Cycling?

935
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,700
Bekah: I- I don't know how to
cycle [laughs].

934
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,500
Kirk: After, you know?

935
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,500
Bekah: Stationary bicycle?

936
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,311
Kirk: After, like, elbow scar
McGee over there. You got a

935
00:49:22,311 --> 00:49:22,641
chance.

936
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,500
Dan: Although, if we're going to
have it -- so, somebody

937
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,500
mentioned triathlons. And
there's like triathlon teams

938
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,300
too. So every -- most
triathlons-

939
00:49:28,300 -->00:49:28,500
Bekah: Oh.

938
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,700
Dan: -they have like team for
competition, you know, as well.

939
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,700
So, if we do a triathlon, would
you do run or swim?

939
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,000
Bekah: Probably swim.

940
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,617
Dan: Alright. So Kirk, that
means you're on running?

941
00:49:37,617 --> 00:49:40,000
[Inaudible].

941
00:49:40,797 --> 00:49:45,500
Kirk: What am I better at than
the two of you ... jokes? Ooh.

942
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,000
Bekah: Ha-ha. Grrr.

942
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,237
Kirk: What am I better at sports
wise?

943
00:49:51,806 --> 00:49:54,626
Dan: No, Joe. Bekah would win at
push-ups easily.

944
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,300
Kirk: Easy.

944
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,500
Bekah: Oh, I don't know. I -- my
shoulder is -- Kirk is still in

945
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,626
the hundred push-ups challenge,
right?

946
00:50:00,987 --> 00:50:03,447
Kirk: Yeah. But I don't do,
like, the full ones. I'm doing

947
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:04,500
like incline. No shame.

948
00:50:05,847 --> 00:50:08,500
Bekah: I -- my -- I hear my
shoulder. I have a torn

949
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,000
something.

951
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,300
Dan: You know, my thing with-
with push-ups, honestly, that

952
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,000
bothers me, is my wrists aren't
flexible. Therefore my wrist

953
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,500
hurt-

953
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:14,700
Bekah: Oh, yeah-

954
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:15,500
Dan: -from bending back.

955
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,000
Bekah: -you gotta work on that.

954
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Dan: Yeah. Like, they don't,
like --

955
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,246
Bekah: My right wrist, from
using the mouse all the time,

956
00:50:20,246 --> 00:50:21,597
is definitely tighter than my
left one.

957
00:50:21,597 --> 00:50:24,146
Dan: Yeah. I'm sure I could work
on it if I want it to. But,

958
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:24,300
yeah.

958
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,456
Kirk: The tunnel- the tunnel I
traveled through the most is

959
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:30,000
carpool [??], for sure. But,
like, they have those things,

960
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,700
like, those things you can fold
instead of pressing your arms

961
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,936
flat on the ground. But they
just -- they hurt-

962
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,300
Bekah: Yeah.

962
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,300
Kirk: -just put your arm in a
different way. So I'm like-

963
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:38,561
Bekah: Yeah.

963
00:50:38,561 --> 00:50:42,300
Kirk: -this just transferred the
pain from like doing this to

965
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,500
like straight through. So it
doesn't help at all.

966
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,000
Dan: Yeah. Did you read Nick's
comment?

967
00:50:46,500 -->00:50:48,000
Bekah: Na- no.

968
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,000
Dan: Nick just says, "I saw
someone mountain biking on a

967
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,700
unicycle in a forest outside of
Montreal. I wave to them and

968
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,000
they fell. I laughed."

969
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,000
Bekah: [All laugh] That's like
a joker, but true story.

970
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Dan: Nick- Nick, that does sound
--

971
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,800
Kirk: It's Montreal. So it's
definitely [inaudible]

972
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,000
[all laugh]. My trip to go home
[inaudible].

973
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,000
Dan: Oh, man. [Inaudible]. I
just imagine them like doing a

969
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
jump [Bekah chuckles] on a
unicycle, waving to Nick, and

970
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,500 
then, like, seeing them veer off
into a tree and yelling "SacrÃ©

971
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,000
bleu," or something like that
[laughs].

972
00:51:16,601 --> 00:51:18,500
Kirk: It's like "The Office".
They have to yell, "Parkour!

973
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,001
Parkour!"

973
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:21,072
Bekah: Oh, my gosh. My kids love
that.

974
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:23,500
Kirk: Then, it'll away. No --

975
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,700
Bekah: A mountain bike unicycle?

00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,500
Dan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know
what?

00:51:25,000--> 00:51:26,001
Bekah: I didn't even know it was
a thing.

976
00:51:26,001 --> 00:51:28,500
Dan: I've- I've seen those for
sure. A-and, like, the people

977
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,000
do, like, insane things on them.
I've- I've seen them once. Oh,

978
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,500
I- I don't think I've seen them
in real life, but I've seen them

980
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,500
on YouTube. If you want to know
more, let me do --

981
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,700
Kirk: I want to -- you know, on
Spiderman, when they tell him

982
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,300
do a flip, and then he does the
flip, and then he was like "Oh,

983
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:42,500
that's-

984
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:42,700
Dan: Yeah.

983
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,000
Kirk: -so cool." I want to be
on, like, both ends of that. I

984
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,300
wanna be the person saying do
the flip and then someone else

985
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,700
does the flip. And someone says
to me, I wanna be able to do the

986
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,000
flip in that moment.

987
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,500
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

988
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,231
Kirk: But that's never gonna
happen. Just, backflips are

989
00:51:56,231 --> 00:51:59,172
terrifying. What am I better at
than the two of you? This is --

990
00:51:59,172 --> 00:51:59,831
I gotta figure this out.

991
00:52,000 --> 00:52:03,700
Bekah: Kindness [chuckles],
documentation-

992
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,300
Kirk: No.

993
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,000
Bekah: -Elm-

994
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,000
Kirk: Yes.

995
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,300
Bekah: -games.

996
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Kirk: Hmm.

992
00:52:08,952 --> 00:52:10,700
Bekah: Well, I don't know if
Dan's better than you at games

993
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,692
or not. I like games, and very
bad at them.

994
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,700
Kirk: I only like like two
things. But I've -- it's --

995
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,000
Bekah: Yoga.

996
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,700
Kirk: Hmm. Not anymore. That's
--

995
00:52:21,911 --> 00:52:23,700
Bekah: Have you seen Dan do
yoga?

996
00:52:23,996 --> 00:52:29,000
Kirk: I would pay money. I
would- I would donate time and

997
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
money to make that happen
[Bekah chuckles].

998
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Dan: I'm --

999
00:52:32,246 --> 00:52:34,500
Bekah: Kirk, Kirk, it is Kirk
Day. You are allowed to ask him

1001
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,700
to do whatever you want-

1002
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,500
Dan: Listen, I'm not doing any
[inaudible] right now.

1003
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,000
Bekah: -right now, okay? No,
we're not [??].

1004
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,000
Kirk: Not like the day of my
daughter's weddings [??]

1005
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
[laughs]. Thank god.

1002
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,000
Dan: [Inaudible]. I don't know.
The -- I just -- I'm not very

1003
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,757
flexible at all that. I'm --
it's- it's a known fact.

1004
00:52:47,757 --> 00:52:49,000
Bekah: Haikus, Kirk.

1005
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Kirk: Oh, yeah.

1006
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,000
Bekah: Poetry. Maybe. I don't
know.

1005
00:52:53,396 --> 00:52:55,500
Kirk: Well, you -- you're-
you're a poet. You poet. You

1006
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:55,700
poem.

1006
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,500
Bekah: Yeah. For sure, yeah
[laughs].

1007
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,700
Dan: We all have dabbled in the
poetry.

1008
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Bekah: We've dab- we have all
three dabbled in the poetry.

1009
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:02,300
Dan: I have --

1110
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:02,500
Kirk: One day --

1007
00:53:02,697 --> 00:53:05,500
Bekah: You may be able to find
all three of our poetry online,

1008
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,300
if you search hard enough
[Bekah and Dan laugh].

1009
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:11,300
Kirk: I used to have a website.
The first website I ever made

1010
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:11,456
was

1011
00:53:11,456 --> 00:53:16,121
a WordPress site. It was called
Shiver Sharks. Cuz that's a

1012
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:18,700
collective noun for sharks, and
I found out. Cuz everyone else

1013
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,882
does like a poet of owls or
like one on ones everyone

1014
00:53:21,882 --> 00:53:23,700
knows. So, I'm like, "Give me a
weird ones like a shiver or

1015
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,700
something like that." Great. And
then I met the -- I saw someone

1015
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:32,500
who had the murder of crows, and
I was like, "Boring." I really

1016
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:37,700
judged them about that. But my
website's gone. So [all laugh].

1017
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,700
I don't know what happened to
it. WordPress was just like,

1017
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:43,000
"You don't do enough."
[Inaudible].

1019
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,000
Dan: Hm.

1020
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:45,700
Bekah: Oh, no.

1018
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Kirk: And I think I saved- I
think I saved everything from it

1019
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:58,000
as a RTF Rich Text. I'm like,
"This is great." Lost that file.

1020
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,700
Worthless. Unhelpful. This was
before I knew about markdown or

1021
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,000
anything, really.

1023
00:54:07,722 --> 00:54:08,112
Bekah: Yeah.

1024
00:54:08,112 --> 00:54:09,000
Dan: Yeah.

1025
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Bekah: Same.

1024
00:54:10,646 --> 00:54:13,827
Kirk: Does anyone remember that
thing we used to use to make

1025
00:54:13,827 --> 00:54:19,376
websites? Ah. My professor in
university used it. Eclipse --

1026
00:54:19,436 --> 00:54:20,000
no.

1027
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,817
Dan: Dreamweaver?

1028
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,700
Bekah: I love Dreamweaver.

1029
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,000
Kirk: Dreamweaver!

1027
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:26,456
Bekah: That was the first time I
ever code, it was in Dreamweaver.

1028
00:54:26,487 --> 00:54:26,666
Dan: Yeah.

1029
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,300
Kirk: Yes.

1029
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,000
Dan: Yeah. I spent years in
Dreamweaver, for sure.

1030
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,500
Kirk: It was --

1030
00:54:31,947 --> 00:54:34,000
Bekah: I wanna do yoga with the
goat too.

1031
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:34,500
Kirk: What?

1031
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,500
Bekah: Vir- Virtual Coffee
retreat at Glenn's house.

1033
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,447
Kirk: I've seen the goat yoga
videos. And as somebody who,

1034
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:45,500
like -- I see goats every day.
Goats poop.

1035
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,257
Dan: That's a real thing.

1036
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,000
Bekah: Yeah.

1037
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,300
Kirk: Goats poop.

1038
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,500
Dan: Is the goat doing yoga too
or is the goat just like --

1037
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,000
Kirk: You do the yoga, and a
bunch of little like kid goats,

1038
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,700
just kind of, like, amble about,
and sometimes they just climb

1039
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,717
you cuz that's their thing.

1040
00:55:00,717 --> 00:55:01,286
Dan: Oh, sure. I mean that --
yeah.

1041
00:55:01,556 --> 00:55:03,700
Bekah: Can we do it with
fainting goats too? And then we

1042
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,500
could, like, jump up and scare
'em?

1043
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,500
Dan: Fireworks.

1044
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,300
Kirk: You're mean to the goats.

1044
00:55:08,396 --> 00:55:10,500
Dan: Yeah, Nick, I use
Fireworks. Yeah, Dreamewea- so

1045
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,000
that's the Macromedia suite,
like-

1046
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,700
Bekah: Oh, yeah.

1047
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,700
Dan: -Dreamweaver, Fireworks,
and then like Flash, if you do a

1046
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:19,000
Flash. And ... there was another
one that I didn't use very much,

1047
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,500
like a more of designing one.
But ... yeah. I was in

1049
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,500
Dreamweavers, Fireworks -- and,
like, Dreamweaver was actually

1051
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:29,000
really good. Even not using the,
like, generated stuff, but it

1053
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,500
was a good, like, code editor.
Like, I used it-

1054
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:30,700
Bekah: Yeah.

1055
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,856
Dan: -as my, like, just code
editor for -- I dunno. I dunno

1056
00:55:34,887 --> 00:55:35,500
when I stopped. But like a long
time. [Inaudible].

1057
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,327
Bekah: Well, my first job out of
-- my first full-time job out

1059
00:55:39,327 --> 00:55:41,786
of college, I was a community
organizer for an environmental

1060
00:55:41,786 --> 00:55:44,000
non-profit. And the executive
director-

1061
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,700
Kirk: [Inaudible] tracks [??].

1062
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,887
Bekah: -my first week, he was

1061
00:55:46,887 --> 00:55:51,300
like, "Do you know how to use --
how -- do you know code?" Like,

1063
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,700
"No." He was like, "Okay. Go
home this weekend and learn HTML

1064
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,700
and CSS. And I was like, "Okay."
Like, Jesse was my boyfriend at

1066
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,500
the time. And I went home and he
had like textbooks on HTML and

1067
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,700
CSS. So, then we went over those
things, and like, "All right, I

1068
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,967
know it. I know it now
[laughs]."

1069
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:07,700
Dan: That's awesome.

1069
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,476
Kirk: It took all weekend. I'm
pretty much an expert.

1070
00:56:10,476 --> 00:56:12,000
Dan: Nailed it. Yep. Yeah.

1072
00:56:13,146 --> 00:56:16,300
Kirk: Just to say, Jeff- Jeff,
in the chat, was like, "Do

1074
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,072
push-ups on your fists, no full
wrist bend." Again, like, we're

1075
00:56:19,072 --> 00:56:22,000
just trading problems here
[Bekah chuckles].

1076
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,467
That's not- that's not better.
Yeah. Shoutout to --

1077
00:56:29,467 --> 00:56:32,077
that's a Dreamweaver. I remember
like a lot of purple. It was all

1078
00:56:32,077 --> 00:56:35,257
like purple involved for some
reason. Oh, I have a great bad

1079
00:56:35,257 --> 00:56:38,047
joke. I just heard it. This is
apparently very popular, but

1080
00:56:38,077 --> 00:56:41,300
it's the first time I heard it.
Bekah, don't ... ruin it.

1081
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:41,500
Bekah: Okay.

1082
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,000
Kirk: Which --

1081
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:44,700
Dan: Or Kirk's gonna fire you.

1082
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,500
Kirk: I -- do-

1083
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,000
Bekah: Kirk doesn't fire me.

1084
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Kirk: -all Java developers wear
glasses?

1082
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:55,527
Dan: This is where you say, "I
don't know why."

1083
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Bekah: Oh. [Dan chuckles] I
don't know why.

1083
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,757
Kirk: That was really good.
Because they can't see sharp.

1084
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:05,000
Dan: Aah.

1084
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,306
Bekah: Ooh, nice. I was not
going in that direction. I was

1085
00:57:08,306 --> 00:57:08,847
going more with --

1086
00:57:09,117 --> 00:57:12,700
Kirk: If- if you were a software
developer in like 1998, that

1087
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,000
would have been incredibly
[inaudible][chuckles]. Like,

1088
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,487
back when they were basically
like --

1088
00:57:17,757 --> 00:57:22,000
Dan: I never heard of C# in
1998. This is like C++ isn't it?

1089
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,967
When did C# become a thing?

1090
00:57:24,356 --> 00:57:29,700
Kirk: Okay. 2005. That's, again,
you know, back when like --

1091
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,996
Bekah: Well, you're like 13. You
didn't hear of anything.

1092
00:57:31,996 --> 00:57:34,000
Dan: I wasn't 13. We don't need
to talk about how old I was,

1093
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,500
but I wasn't -- I was in
computer science in college,

1094
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,286
which was after that. And --

1095
00:57:39,286 --> 00:57:41,700
Kirk: Nick Taylor's heard it
though. That's all the

1096
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,000
validation I need.

1097
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:47,000
Dan: [Inaudible] C++. Does C++
not exist anymore?

1097
00:57:47,186 --> 00:57:51,500
Kirk: Yeah. People use it to
write-

1098
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,700
Dan: What's the difference
between that and C#?

1099
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,387
Kirk: -Unity -- whoa, whoa,
buddy.

1098
00:57:55,387 --> 00:57:56,500
Dan: I don't know. I'm asking.

1099
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,000
Bekah: How dare you.

1100
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,500
Kirk: I mean --

1101
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,700
Dan: I'm not- I'm not saying
there's no difference. I'm

1099
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,000
literally asking. I don't know.

1100
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,572
Kirk: C# is all .NET, right?
It's all Microsoft.

1101
00:58:02,572 --> 00:58:03,000
Dan: Oh, okay.

1101
00:58:03,572 --> 00:58:07,500
Kirk: Right? That's this -- if
you're in Microsoft, 90% of

1102
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:14,700
the time you're writing C#. And
C++ is not. C++ is still

1104
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:21,700
considered like the lang du jour
for like high-performance stuff

1106
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:26,700
if you don't wanna get, like,
down to C, I guess. But I feel

1107
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,300
like C++, their [??] favorite
thing to do is like complain

1108
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,700
about C++ [chuckles].

1109
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,000
Dan: [Chuckles] Sure.

1108
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:32,621
Kirk: Kinda like JavaScript
devs.

1109
00:58:32,621 --> 00:58:34,406
Dan: Like, yeah, you -- if you
get to a certain level, that's

1110
00:58:34,406 --> 00:58:35,351
just gonna be --

1111
00:58:35,351 --> 00:58:37,871
Kirk: Yeah. Like, if it's useful
enough, like, there'll be enough

1112
00:58:37,871 --> 00:58:40,300
code written, then there isn't
something to complain about.

1114
00:58:40,782 --> 00:58:45,000
Dan: Like, Emily ... tells
people -- like, sh- she was a --

1115
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,300
on a trip with her grandma and
she's like, "Yeah, Dan hates

1116
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,300
computers." And she knows that,
like, I do this -- I do this

1117
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,500
for a living, you know? But it's
true. [Laughs] I'm like -- I

1118
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,700
just -- she- she didn't
understand -- you know, she's

1119
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,500
like, "What? What does that
mean?" She's like, "Yeah. Dan

1119
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,300
hates computers." I'm like
[laughs] -- cuz she told me a

1120
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,700
story -- cuz I was like -- oh,
yesterday, I spent like three

1121
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,592
hours trying to get â€” I almost
did it. I almost went over a

1122
00:59:05,592 --> 00:59:11,231
PG-13 again â€” Ruby to work again
on my computer. And it was

1123
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:14,112
really annoying and it, like,
killed my whole day, you know?

1124
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:17,500
Anyway, I was complaining about
it at home, and was like, "Hey,

1125
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,000
I hate computers-

1126
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,500
Kirk: The first time --

1127
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,000
Dan: -I don't like them." So ...
you know?

1126
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,961
Kirk: Well, the first time I
learned Ruby, it was similar to

1127
00:59:23,021 --> 00:59:27,000
Bekah's situation. I was in a
internship. And they were like,

1128
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,500
"Well, we can't -- any -- you
can't get any developers to help

1128
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,300
in this project. So you guys are
gonna do it yourself." And we

1129
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,000
were like, "Okay." "Any of you
know Ruby?" "No."

1130
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,572
And then -- this was back in the
time they were like, "Here's the

1131
00:59:37,572 --> 00:59:41,382
instructions for how to install
this on your machine. If you get

1132
00:59:41,382 --> 00:59:45,822
it wrong, you'll probably break
the machine. Good luck." So,

1133
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:49,500
that's like [chuckles] what's
[inaudible] Ruby in, and it was

1134
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,000
super painful. And I didn't,
like, look at a line of Ruby

1134
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,092
again for like 10 years. So ...
you know? Onboarding matters.

1136
00:59:58,092 --> 01:00:02,700
Dan: Yeah. No. That's -- it's
like, it doesn't matter. Every

1137
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,500
time I have to do something

1138
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,500
with Ruby -- and I- I just do it
so infrequently that it's, you

1140
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,000
know, that's why it's a problem
for me, obviously. But --

1142
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,681
Kirk: To be fair, I feel like I
do Python stuff all the time

1143
01:00:11,681 --> 01:00:15,500
and I still mess it up, like,
getting it to work on my

1144
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,581
machine. I'm just -- I just want

1145
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:23,000
things to work. I just wanna
click work and then they work.

1146
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,000
Dan: Yep.

1146
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,382
Kirk: Specifically the
installation and running part.

1147
01:00:26,382 --> 01:00:26,500
Bekah: Yes.

1148
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:27,000
Dan: Yep.

1147
01:00:27,311 --> 01:00:28,302
Bekah: That's the worst.

1148
01:00:30,132 --> 01:00:33,731
Kirk: I got a tutorial, I'm
like, "Oh, I'm gonna NPM,

1149
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:38,981
install, do your thing. NPM did
its thing. Do the thing, run,

1150
01:00:39,371 --> 01:00:43,061
didn't work. I Google the err-
you know, it's bad when you

1151
01:00:43,061 --> 01:00:45,500
search for an error and it takes
you to, like, the official

1152
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:51,000
GitHub, like, issues unresolved
page. Like, "Oh, no."

1153
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,500
Bekah: Damn.

1154
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Kirk: I can't escape [inaudible]
--

1153
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,500
Dan: No, I was deep into that
yesterday. A bunch of M1s that

1154
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,000
-- doesn't matter.

1155
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,300
Bekah: Yeah.

1155
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,112
Dan: Anyway, computers are
annoying. And I hate them.

1156
01:01:00,592 --> 01:01:03,000
Bekah: Also, I have to go. So
[laughs] --

1157
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,652
Dan: Ooh. You have to leave
at 3? Not 3.30? Aah.

1158
01:01:06,652 --> 01:01:08,931
Kirk: I thought you were hanging
out for like a week.

1159
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,000
Dan: Oh, man.

1159
01:01:11,362 --> 01:01:12,500
Bekah: I have children.

1160
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,500
Dan: Bekah needs to go.

1161
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,500
Bekah: I have to go clean up the
creek in my neighbourhood.

1162
001:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,500
Dan: She needs to go clean up
the creek.

1163
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,000
Kirk: Do you smokey the bear?

1164
01:01:20,472 --> 01:01:23,500
Bekah: [Chuckles] For earth day.
Week. Month.

1165
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Dan: Kirk, I just wanna say
happy Kirk Day to us all.

1167
01:01:31,722 --> 01:01:34,500
Bekah: We're glad to have you as
our one and only Kirk-

1168
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,952
Dan: Thank- thank you for
joining us [chuckles].

1168
01:01:35,952 --> 01:01:36,641
Bekah: -in the entire world.

1169
01:01:37,331 --> 01:01:37,700
Kirk: I am-

1170
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,500
Dan: That too.

1171
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:43,700
Kirk: -I'm happy to provide me
as a catalyst for the cool

1170
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:48,000
people here. Kirk Day is weird.
But the people who like it are

1171
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,452
great [all laugh]. We're kind of
settled on this.

1172
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,300
Dan: I'm glad you're around. We
didn't plan any of this at all.

1173
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:56,500
So-

1174
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

1175
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,700
Dan: -I appreciate you, you
know?

1174
01:01:58,992 --> 01:02:00,822
Bekah: Dan was like, "We should
have an agenda." And I was like

1175
01:02:00,822 --> 01:02:02,862
--

1175
01:02:02,862 --> 01:02:04,500
Dan: We did get a lot of stuff
done today.

1176
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,300
Bekah: We got a ton of stuff
done.

1177
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,700
Dan: It was a- it was a good --

1176
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,282
Bekah: But most importantly,
we saw Kirk on Kirk Day and

1177
01:02:09,282 --> 01:02:10,481
changed our profile pictures-

1178
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,300
Dan: Indeed.

1179
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,000
Bekah: -for Kirk.

1178
01:02:12,266 --> 01:02:15,500
Kirk: Nick Taylor's profile
picture is sideways. I don't --

1179
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:20,000
Bekah: [Bekah and dan laugh] We
noticed that.

1180
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,447
Dan: That's awesome.

1180
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:22,347
Bekah: It all makes sense.

1181
01:02:23,047 --> 01:02:26,000
Kirk: The Kirk has gone rogue.
[Bekah laughs] We are a legion.

1182
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,500
Bekah: [Laughs] Oh, my gosh.
Well, that seems like a great

1183
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,927
way to end.

1183
01:02:30,927 --> 01:02:33,000
Dan: Yep. That's a good one.
Thank you everybody for hanging

1185
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
out, and happy Kirk Day, and --

1186
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Bekah: We'll see you all
Thursday.

1187
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,700
Dan: See you Thursday.

1186
01:02:38,396 --> 01:02:41,300
Kirk: Don't- don't do another
one. No more Kirk Days. From

1187
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:41,500
Kirk.

1188
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,300
Dan: See you next year at Kirk
Day.

1189
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,000
Bekah: We do what we want.

1190
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,000
Kirk: [Inaudible] next year. The
end.

1191
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,000
Bekah: You gonna fire us
[laughs]?

1192
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:50,000
Kirk: Yeah. I'm gonna fire every
single one of you.

1193
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Bekah: You said you wouldn't
fire me.

1187
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,000
Kirk: Yeah. But it's collective.
It's fine.

1188
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:56,000
Dan: Alright.

1189
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:57,500
Kirk: Okay. Bye.
