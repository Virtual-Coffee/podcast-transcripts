7
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,879
with me today is my co-host,Dan.

8
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:33,598
Dan: What up back?How's it going?

9
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,439
Bekah: It's going good.How's it
going with you?

10
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:41,863
Dan: It's going very,very well.
Um,we just finished recording a

11
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:45,793
really great episode with Caitlin
Floyd.So Caitlin is a front end

12
00:00:45,793 --> 00:00:49,311
developer who transitioned into
tech from a background in

13
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:53,932
linguistics and education and
nonprofit management.Um,and,uh,

14
00:00:53,962 --> 00:00:56,421
she had a really interesting
journey.She,she was doing

15
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:59,332
bootcamp in the,the middle of
bootcamp is when the pandemic,

16
00:00:59,362 --> 00:01:02,031
uh,shutdowns happened.And so that
was a really fascinating story to

17
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:05,272
hear about.And um,and then she
shared with us a lot of thoughts

18
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:09,561
on,um,mentorship.And it was a
really,really good conversation.

19
00:01:10,206 --> 00:01:13,626
Bekah: Yeah.I appreciated hearing
all of her thoughts on,uh,how to,

20
00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:18,156
how to be mentored,how to be a
mentor,and how we all can kind of

21
00:01:18,156 --> 00:01:21,096
men.Mentor each other.I think
that she did a good job of

22
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:24,216
redefining what we traditionally
think of mentorship in a way that

23
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:26,257
will be really useful to a lot of
people.

24
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:29,992
Dan: Yeah,totally.There's,
there's a lot of,uh,Details and,

25
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:32,721
you know,the,the mentor mentee
relationship can look different

26
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:35,421
in a lot of different ways.And I
think that Caitlin did a,a great

27
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:39,412
job of breaking down,uh,breaking
down those differences and,you

28
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:42,111
know,some of the benefits and
downsides of,of different

29
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:48,171
relationships and,um,ways that we
can find those relationships in,

30
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:51,712
in our,in our careers,in our
lives.Uh,whether it's from the

31
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:55,611
mentee perspective or the mentor
perspective.Um,she had a lot of

32
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:56,361
great thoughts on that.

33
00:01:57,087 --> 00:02:01,796
Bekah: Yeah,so we start every
episode of the podcast,like we

34
00:02:01,796 --> 00:02:04,527
start every Virtual Coffee.We
introduce ourselves with our

35
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:08,217
name,where we're from,what we do,
and a random check-in question.

36
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:19,913
We hope you enjoy this episode.
Today's random question is,if you

37
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:23,872
were a character in a video game,
what would your special ability

38
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:29,362
or power up be?I.My name is
Bekah.I am the developer

39
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:35,062
experience lead at Open Sauce.
I'm from a small town in Ohio and

40
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:42,502
my special ability or power up,
what was I,I was playing Smash

41
00:02:42,502 --> 00:02:48,532
Bros the other day,and there were
some cool abilities,but like

42
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:52,582
somebody I think created a portal
and could jump through it.That

43
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:58,673
was a pretty cool one.But I
always did like in Mario,like the

44
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:04,073
getting the fire flower or
whatever it's called,but like who

45
00:03:04,073 --> 00:03:07,163
are you gonna hit with the fire?
Like you In real life,you can't

46
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:10,973
really just like fireball
somebody I don't think.

47
00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:16,217
Dan: I mean,you could,but it
would be illegal

48
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:17,002
Bekah: Would it be nice?

49
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:17,957
Dan: probably immoral.

50
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:21,233
Bekah: So I guess just a portal.

51
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:27,453
Dan: Uh,okay.Yeah,I am Dan.I live
in Cleveland and I do website

52
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:31,592
development.And,um,yeah,I mean,
so the question starts with if

53
00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:34,112
you're a character in a video
game,so like,are you in,in the

54
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:38,043
video game or is this like,I can
take a power from any video game

55
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:39,062
and just apply it to my

56
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:44,557
Bekah: Oh,I suppose it meant in a
video game,but I decided to apply

57
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,997
it to real life instead.

58
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:49,967
Dan: I mean,right.They're
different,right?So like,I mean,

59
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:52,788
the easy answer for me is the
star,you know,for Mario,right?

60
00:03:52,788 --> 00:03:56,087
Where you just become invincible
and you get some later ones,you

61
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:58,698
become faster and stuff,and
you're really flashy and

62
00:03:58,927 --> 00:03:59,557
Bekah: you destroy

63
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:03,587
Dan: uh,sure.Yeah.I'm not big on
destroying people.Uh,I know

64
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:08,987
that's kind of your jam,but,uh,
portals made me like,that was a

65
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:13,668
good call too.Um,there's the game
portal and I think it's called

66
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:16,398
Portal.Uh,it's a video game and
it's really,really cool.So you

67
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:19,112
have like a gun and you can,you
know,shoot a.The entrance one

68
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:22,593
place and then the exit,another
place,you know,and,and uh,

69
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:26,252
basically just instantly
transport to anywhere.That's

70
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:29,463
cool.That's cool too.So if I,if
I'm going real life,I'm gonna do,

71
00:04:29,492 --> 00:04:33,122
do the portal thing.If I'm going
video game,I suppose the,the

72
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:37,052
power up,you know,the star from,
from Mario,you know,plus you get

73
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:40,293
to wear overalls all the time,
which is cool.He got a nice hat.

74
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:45,153
So,I dunno,that's my answer.Go
ahead Caitlin.

75
00:04:45,593 --> 00:04:49,793
Caitlin: Um,yeah,this is a tricky
one.My,the first thing that came

76
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:54,367
to mind was just like I.Power up,
like energy.I'm always tired.Uh,

77
00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:56,557
so it would be nice to do that.
But the portal thing is

78
00:04:56,557 --> 00:05:00,848
interesting too.I like,there's a,
a similar concept in this classic

79
00:05:00,877 --> 00:05:04,598
Japanese,um,cartoon where he has
like a door that can take him

80
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:08,798
anywhere,but he also has these
like pills you can take to learn

81
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:11,617
anything you want.You just like,
it's like a tiny little book and

82
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:13,927
you eat it and you can learn
anything you want.I think it's

83
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:17,437
for24hours or something,but that
could be really handy too.Um,

84
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:20,572
It's not a video game,it's a
cartoon,but I feel like that

85
00:05:20,572 --> 00:05:24,533
could be a video game.Power to
just knowledge,power.Uh,I'll go

86
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:24,892
with that.

87
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:29,538
Dan: I like that.And can you,uh,
for the listeners do

88
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:33,487
Caitlin: Oh,I didn't do my intro.
Sorry.I was so,I was thinking so

89
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:37,148
hard about my answer to the
question.Yeah,sorry.My name is

90
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:41,288
Caitlin.Uh,I use she her
pronouns.Um,I am based in the

91
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:46,117
Washington DC area and I'm a
front end developer here.Um,and

92
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:49,538
yeah,knowledge would be my
superpower of choice.

93
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:51,533
Bekah: I like it.

94
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:55,757
Dan: Yeah,there's that.Also not a
video game,but uh,the movie

95
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:59,447
Limitless.You know,there's that
pill and just like makes you,I

96
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:02,927
guess,super smart,but also able
to learn things very quickly.I

97
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:05,088
don't,I haven't watched that
movie for a long time,but you

98
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:07,427
know that,that.If there was no
side effects,that always seemed

99
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:11,838
like a pretty cool,uh,you know,
fake thing too.It's just the

100
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,937
ability to use your brain better,
you know?

101
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:18,038
Bekah: Yeah,I could use that.I'm
using my brain better.

102
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:20,708
Caitlin: Couldn't we all?

103
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:25,252
Bekah: Well,Caitlin,thanks so
much for being here with us

104
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:28,882
today.We're very happy to finally
have you on the podcast

105
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:30,987
Caitlin: Yeah.Thanks for having
me.

106
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:33,795
Bekah: Um,we always like to get
started with your origin story,

107
00:06:33,795 --> 00:06:36,906
so let us know like how you got
to this point in your career.

108
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:40,846
Caitlin: Sure.Yeah.So,um,yeah,
thanks for having me today.I'm

109
00:06:40,846 --> 00:06:48,180
very excited to be here.Um,so my
journey into tech,um,felt.In some

110
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,511
ways kind of inevitable,but it
was a very intentional decision

111
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:55,951
on my part.Um,like a lot of
people in the VC community,I had

112
00:06:55,951 --> 00:07:00,420
a previous career,uh,before going
into tech.My,my career was in

113
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,980
language access.Um,so I studied
linguistics as an undergrad,went

114
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,011
into teaching English to speakers
of other languages,both

115
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:12,031
domestically and abroad.Um,did
some teacher training,so teaching

116
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,370
teachers.How to teach.Um,and
then,uh,moved into nonprofit

117
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,190
management at a refugee
resettlement agency where I

118
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,870
oversaw the education program
there.Um,so I loved that whole

119
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:29,221
career.Uh,it was really
rewarding,but uh,at the same time

120
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:33,690
I was starting to experience
pretty intense burnout,um,and.

121
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:38,730
Decided to kind of take stock of
what I wanted out of a career,

122
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,300
because I kind of realized I
hadn't been super intentional up

123
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,800
until that point about crafting
my career.Um,and burnout was a

124
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,185
great,uh,motivator to do that.So
I,I realized that,um,I already

125
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:56,656
knew that.I loved linguistics,
communication,problem solving,

126
00:07:56,985 --> 00:08:00,555
um,like pattern recognition.
Those were things I liked and,

127
00:08:00,586 --> 00:08:05,656
um,that I was good at.Um,but as
far as what I wanted from a job,

128
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:09,286
I knew that I wanted something
that was a change of pace from

129
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:13,115
constant triaging of problems,
uh,like you do in.Bekah,as you

130
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:17,375
know,in teaching,um,as well as in
nonprofit management.Um,and so I

131
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,315
wanted something that allowed me
like deep work and flow state.

132
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:24,815
Um,and I also wanted something
more importantly that would give

133
00:08:24,815 --> 00:08:29,826
me flexibility to kind of,um,I
have work-life balance.Uh,I

134
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:35,956
wanted to.Work to live,not live
to work.Um,and so something that

135
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:40,096
could give me flexibility about
where I wanted to work from,uh,

136
00:08:40,096 --> 00:08:43,966
the concept of remote work was
really novel in2019.Uh,less so

137
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:48,676
now,but it's still a big benefit
to working in tech.Um,and you

138
00:08:48,676 --> 00:08:52,515
know,also when you're working.
Um,so these were all factors that

139
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:55,966
kind of,I had this mixing pot of
ideas and it kind of distilled

140
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:59,025
down into,I should really
consider software engineering.

141
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:03,375
Um,this is kind of a.Great fit
for all of those factors.It's,

142
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:08,625
it's new and exciting.It's a
growing industry.Um,and so I,uh,

143
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:15,105
I went to a coding bootcamp,um,
and,uh,it was a struggle,but I,I

144
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:19,336
made it through.There were some
tears shed,but,um,I made it.Uh,

145
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:24,166
and then,um,I landed at my
current job,um,at a news agency,

146
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:27,046
uh,where I'm doing front end
development.And it's been,um,a

147
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:30,791
really rewarding,um,Job,and I'm
really happy that I made that

148
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:31,030
change.

149
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:35,416
Bekah: That's so good to hear.
Uh,can you talk a little bit more

150
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,385
about your bootcamp?Were you in
person online?How long did that

151
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:38,535
take?

152
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:44,985
Caitlin: Yeah,so I signed up for
an in-person bootcamp,but uh,we

153
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:49,666
were supposed to finish in May of
2020,so it did not end as an

154
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:54,346
in-person bootcamp.Uh,we started
in-person,um,and then I was also

155
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:58,725
in New York City at the time,so
that was,uh,hit quite early,um,

156
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:03,645
in the country.So,uh,Yeah,we were
in person for most of the

157
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:07,635
learning modules.The second half
of the bootcamp was,um,more

158
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:11,775
project based and that we had one
week in person before they told

159
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,035
us we were gonna try remote for
quote unquote,for maybe a week or

160
00:10:16,035 --> 00:10:19,936
so.Uh,we never saw each other
again,which was,uh,unfortunate.

161
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:22,155
It was a good learning
experience,though I had a great

162
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:26,596
team and,um,we learned trial by
fire.We learned how to

163
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:30,615
collaborate remotely.Um,Luckily,
we were all very,you know,

164
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:36,405
communication was something we
all valued.So,um,it was,um,yeah,

165
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:38,566
I mean,I don't have anything to
compare it to.I've always

166
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,836
collaborated with other
developers remotely,uh,because

167
00:10:41,836 --> 00:10:44,926
of,of the nature of how things
played out,but I really enjoy it.

168
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:47,745
Um,yeah.Yeah,it was great.

169
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,083
Bekah: I think you might be the
first person,that we talked to.

170
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:59,014
Um,who was impacted by the
pandemic during their bootcamp

171
00:10:59,014 --> 00:11:03,033
experience,cuz so many people
decided during the pandemic to

172
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,964
change careers,but you were in
the midst of it during that,

173
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:10,354
which I think is probably more
chaotic because,I don't know,

174
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:13,443
like with my kids coming home,
like they sent home all their

175
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:16,894
books and stuff,but nobody knew
what to do.The,the learning

176
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:20,583
experience was awful just
because,It was not anticipated.

177
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,673
That had to be.That sounds like
it was a,a big challenge.

178
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:28,729
Caitlin: Yeah,definitely it was,
um,Yeah,I was not prepared for,

179
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:32,269
for that.I mean,no one was
prepared for the pivot,but it was

180
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:36,828
an interesting time to have quit
my job and entered,uh,not very

181
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:42,109
junior friendly workforce as an
engineer.Um,but I mean,luckily

182
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:46,489
our teachers,you know,were very
tech savvy,uh,being,you know,

183
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:51,798
tech professionals.So that pivot
I think was.It's easier for them

184
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:55,548
than other teachers I've known
who worked in,you know,not in the

185
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,958
tech space.I think that I,like my
heart went out to so many,I knew

186
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,269
a lot of English teachers who
were having to figure that out.

187
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:06,078
My mom also is a teacher,uh,and
she was having to teach her peers

188
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:12,139
how to,like,what is Zoom?Like
what is a webcam?Uh,and it was,

189
00:12:12,229 --> 00:12:15,558
uh,it was chaotic for all of us.
But yeah,that,that was an

190
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:18,469
interesting time to be going
through bootcamp.

191
00:12:19,918 --> 00:12:23,668
Dan: Aside from,you know,the.I
don't know,technical adjustments

192
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:27,658
that ev everybody would expect.
Are there like any,how did the,

193
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:31,379
like learning process,I mean,I
know it changed,but,you know,

194
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:33,899
comparing and contrasting since
it was the same class right?You

195
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,649
know,halfway through whatever.
Um,how,how did it,you know,how

196
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:41,729
did not being in the room with
people affect your,like the

197
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:44,969
learning process and maybe your
enjoyment and or effectiveness of

198
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:45,719
it?Um,

199
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:48,798
Caitlin: Yeah,I mean,I am really
grateful that we at least had

200
00:12:48,798 --> 00:12:52,849
that initial period of time to
get to know each other.So I was

201
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:56,269
at least more comfortable asking
my teachers questions or my peers

202
00:12:56,274 --> 00:13:00,499
because I had,you know,like run
into them,uh,at the,in the

203
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:04,879
kitchen or something.And,and we
had that foundation,but pivoting

204
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:12,918
into being remote,um,it was just
such a,A paradigm shift of how,

205
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,198
how do I approach even like pair
programming.Uh,we had to,we were

206
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,828
like,all right,let's Google,you
know,remote pairing tools,uh,

207
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:25,249
figure it out.Um,and so I think
our default was to just

208
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:28,849
over-communicating,which I think
was the right call of just,you

209
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:32,568
know,if,if you have a question,
just ask it.Um,and if you,you

210
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:36,724
know,if you are.You know,I don't
know if you see foresee a

211
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:42,453
possible problem,just bring it
up.Um,my,my project,um,teammates

212
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:47,193
and I were pretty much on Zoom
all day,which was,uh,that was

213
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:51,543
before we had ever heard the term
Zoom fatigue.But um,yeah,it was

214
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:54,634
kind of interesting because in
some ways it was kind of,

215
00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:59,688
Exciting to kind of realize,
okay,we can share screens and we

216
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:02,869
can both be researching separate
things at the same time,still see

217
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:06,259
each other's screens.We can be
looking at docs and kind of like

218
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:11,389
distill down,um,what we've been
learning or watching a video.Um,

219
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:16,278
and so I think that kind of
helped me to think more flexibly

220
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:20,989
in terms of how I was learning
and kind of think more,um,I feel

221
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:24,469
like it,it made me work the
elasticity of my brain in a

222
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:29,479
different way.Um,so yeah,I mean,
again,I,I don't have anything

223
00:14:30,109 --> 00:14:35,658
like to compare it to like my
chaotic version was,was the

224
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:40,158
version.I know.Um,but I think it
helped me to get an appreciation

225
00:14:40,158 --> 00:14:46,278
for some of the collaborative,
collaborative tools that are

226
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:49,833
available to you.Remotely that
are not available to you in

227
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,984
person.Usually you hear people
making the opposite case.Um,

228
00:14:53,884 --> 00:14:56,163
there's valid arguments to be
made there,but I think there are

229
00:14:56,163 --> 00:15:00,274
some benefits to working remotely
that you don't get working in

230
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:00,813
person.So,

231
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:05,908
Dan: Yeah,totally.I,I,I,uh,I was
just,I was curious because I,I

232
00:15:05,913 --> 00:15:08,999
feel like the stories that we've
heard of people doing boot camps

233
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:13,183
that were more successful,I.Um,
were often ones where there's

234
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:16,634
more contact,more communication
with other students.Um,you know,

235
00:15:16,754 --> 00:15:20,803
whether that's in person or,um,I
know one member like did just on

236
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:22,874
their own,but,you know,made a
study group with,with the other

237
00:15:22,874 --> 00:15:27,553
students,uh,and communicated like
that together.Right.Um,and,uh,I

238
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:30,464
feel like the,the people that had
a good experience,um,you know,

239
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:34,094
in,in boot camps,uh,often have
similar stories like that,you

240
00:15:34,094 --> 00:15:36,254
know,and so I was,I was curious
and it's good to hear that you

241
00:15:36,254 --> 00:15:39,823
guys worked it out,right?The,
that,the,um,Since you already

242
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:42,854
knew each other,maybe it was a
lot easier to just try to push

243
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:45,464
through some of those things.
Whereas if you had started all

244
00:15:45,464 --> 00:15:49,813
remote,you know,it's all just
strangers and,um,maybe it

245
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:52,964
would've been a harder,uh,
especially if the,the teachers or

246
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:55,124
whatever don't encourage that
sort of thing,you know,or don't,

247
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:59,144
um,put a emphasis on it.Um,so I
don't know.That sounds cool.It

248
00:15:59,144 --> 00:16:02,354
sounds like you,you all did like
a really good job of,of,uh,

249
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:03,163
making it through that

250
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:05,224
Caitlin: Yeah,we did our best.

251
00:16:05,894 --> 00:16:06,104
Dan: Yeah.

252
00:16:06,604 --> 00:16:06,783
Caitlin: Yeah.

253
00:16:08,313 --> 00:16:10,443
Bekah: What was the mentorship
like as you went through boot

254
00:16:10,443 --> 00:16:13,083
camp?Was that a thing?Do,do you
feel like you had good

255
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,104
experiences there?

256
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:18,933
Caitlin: Yeah,we,so our program
had,I,I think this is pretty

257
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:25,053
common in bootcamps of some kind
of a TA position,um,where those

258
00:16:25,053 --> 00:16:28,024
are people who have recently gone
through the bootcamp and they're,

259
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:32,764
uh,there to serve as extra
support for,um,current students.

260
00:16:32,764 --> 00:16:37,458
And so we had that program,um,
Which was really,really helpful

261
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:42,288
because sometimes you feel a
little,you,something's not

262
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:44,719
clicking very quickly,and if
you're talking to your teacher

263
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,239
who knows it,like the back of
their hand,it can be a little

264
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:51,379
intimidating to ask questions.
So,um,having someone who's a

265
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:54,604
little bit more closely.More
recently gone through,the

266
00:16:54,604 --> 00:16:58,744
experience you had gone through
was really helpful for,um,asking

267
00:16:58,744 --> 00:17:03,214
technical questions or even
asking more career strategic,uh,

268
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:08,074
questions of like,you know,how do
I work on a resume or something

269
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,753
like that.Um,and so I thought
that,um,our program did a really

270
00:17:12,753 --> 00:17:18,334
great job of picking,uh,People
for those positions who were

271
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:21,874
interested in helping us to
develop our skills,who were not

272
00:17:22,114 --> 00:17:26,284
just like looking for a resume
booster,but actually had,um,some

273
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:30,663
of the skills to back it up,um,
the technical skills and the more

274
00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:35,163
the soft skills,um,needed to
support very vulnerable people

275
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:39,453
who are feeling dumb every day.
Um,and,and yeah,I thought that

276
00:17:39,453 --> 00:17:42,364
was a,a pretty crucial part of my
experience.

277
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:44,733
Bekah: What do you think some of
those skills are that make

278
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:45,903
somebody a good mentor?

279
00:17:46,594 --> 00:17:51,933
Caitlin: Ooh,great question.Um,I
think that first and foremost,

280
00:17:52,144 --> 00:18:02,134
um,having a strong sense of
curiosity,um,and being,I think

281
00:18:02,134 --> 00:18:06,544
that seeking mentorship can be a
very vulnerable position.And so

282
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:11,868
having empathy for that and,um,
Not being judgmental of someone

283
00:18:11,868 --> 00:18:14,719
who's asking you questions is,is
a really important starting

284
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:19,159
point.Creating that trust,uh,
with someone to open up and seek

285
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,568
advice.Um,yeah,I would say that's
probably the most important

286
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:29,538
thing.Um,and f for on the,on the
empathy point,being able to put

287
00:18:29,538 --> 00:18:32,449
yourself in someone else's shoes,
um,whether or not you've

288
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:35,239
necessarily had the exact same
experience,being able to relate,

289
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:39,933
um,experiences to your own and,
and considering.What might be

290
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:42,544
different and what challenges
someone might be facing that are

291
00:18:42,544 --> 00:18:46,864
different than you,um,will help
you to give better advice than if

292
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:51,963
you're just kind of just making
it like all about me.This is,you

293
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:54,814
know,everything that worked for
me.Um,considering what might have

294
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:56,374
worked for you might not work for
someone else.

295
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:03,124
Bekah: Yeah.I love that.It's so
important,um,to be able to.Get

296
00:19:03,124 --> 00:19:05,854
yourself in somebody else's
viewpoint because everybody

297
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,253
learns in different ways.They
understand differently,and you

298
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:12,574
have to be able to explain those
things.And I think that,you know,

299
00:19:12,574 --> 00:19:16,054
Caitlin,you've done a great job
at Virtual Coffee and a lot of

300
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:19,834
other places in supporting other
people.So do you wanna talk a

301
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:24,064
little bit about how that role
has shifted for you?So how you

302
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:29,884
went from being the one mentored
to being the mentor?Yep.That's

303
00:19:29,884 --> 00:19:30,034
it.

304
00:19:30,993 --> 00:19:33,513
Caitlin: Yeah.Thanks so much for
saying that.That's very,um,nice

305
00:19:33,513 --> 00:19:39,348
of you to say,um,Yeah,I think
that my introduction to the

306
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:42,679
concept of mentorship was very
much from a place of desperation

307
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:45,469
and like,I need someone to help
me and tell me what to do because

308
00:19:45,473 --> 00:19:50,269
I don't know what I'm doing.Um,
and that is not the best,uh,

309
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:54,199
place to be coming from.I think,
uh,what really helped me as a

310
00:19:54,439 --> 00:20:01,189
mentee,uh,was.Starting to reframe
that relationship as,um,you know,

311
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:06,618
not like this all-knowing person
who's distilling knowledge down

312
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:09,469
to me,but just someone else who's
been where I'm at and has

313
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:14,868
experience to share and that I
can learn from.Um,kind of see it,

314
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:18,648
reframing it that way was helpful
to me in not being afraid to seek

315
00:20:18,648 --> 00:20:23,148
out mentors.Um,I also,it was
really helpful to me hearing

316
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:26,838
about the concept of peer
mentorship,uh,because that also

317
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:30,138
made it a little bit more
attainable that,oh,like I can

318
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:34,519
seek mentorship from my peers.I
could also give mentorship to my

319
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:38,058
peers.Um,you know,I might have
some experience in a specific

320
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:43,548
area,uh,that's valuable to them.
Um,so I think kind of what helped

321
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:47,868
me start to shift into taking on
some mentor,some mentoring

322
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:52,864
opportunities was I.Uh,kind of
trying to embody that duality of

323
00:20:52,864 --> 00:20:58,503
having the curiosity of more of a
student.Um,and also kind of

324
00:20:58,653 --> 00:21:01,624
trying to take on some of the,
more of the generosity of a

325
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:06,064
teacher,um,and realizing that you
can do both.You don't have to be

326
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:10,443
like,I am now a mentor.I am no
longer a mentee.Like it's,it's a

327
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:13,534
fluid relationship there.Um,and
you might even have relationships

328
00:21:13,534 --> 00:21:16,503
with some people where you fill
both of those roles depending on

329
00:21:16,503 --> 00:21:20,298
the day.I like,for example,I have
a,um,A colleague that I work

330
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:23,509
with,uh,we started on the exact
same day.Um,and we check in

331
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:27,469
regularly and sometimes she is
giving me more advice,sometimes

332
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:33,019
I'm giving her more.Um,and so
like that helped kind of ease me

333
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:36,828
along the river of mentorship,I
guess where I,I was kind of

334
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:40,848
understanding that it's not a
finite position that you take.

335
00:21:40,848 --> 00:21:44,328
It's,it's just kind of a,it's
just relationships at the end of

336
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:47,298
the day.It's just scary words to
describe relationships that we

337
00:21:47,298 --> 00:21:47,689
all have.

338
00:21:49,648 --> 00:21:53,249
Dan: Do you have an,in your
current situation,any,like any,

339
00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:57,584
um,Any mentor or mentee
relationships that are like

340
00:21:57,584 --> 00:22:01,574
defined that way?You know,uh,I
mean the,the relationship between

341
00:22:01,574 --> 00:22:03,854
your colleague sounds like really
good and healthy,you know,work

342
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:06,943
relationship.But,um,I was just
curious if there's,if there's a

343
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:09,614
situations that you're in now
where,there,where it's like it

344
00:22:09,614 --> 00:22:12,403
is,it does have that scary word
attached to it,you know,like

345
00:22:12,403 --> 00:22:13,003
officially.

346
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:17,558
Caitlin: Yeah.Um,at my job I
don't currently have.Either a

347
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:22,358
formal mentor or mentee.Um,but I
do,uh,volunteer often with the

348
00:22:22,358 --> 00:22:25,778
collab lab,which,um,I know you've
both heard of,uh,there's a lot of

349
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,028
people in Virtual Coffee,but for
anyone listening,if they don't

350
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:31,778
know,it's a program that is
designed specifically to provide

351
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:37,023
mentorship to or early career
developers.Um,And I started there

352
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:42,753
as a mentee,uh,like as a,we call
them collabs.Um,and you know,I

353
00:22:42,753 --> 00:22:47,614
formally had a few people,uh,who
were my mentors.Actually Jono was

354
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:52,173
one of my,uh,mentors.Um,and that
was really nice having,sometimes

355
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:55,503
it is helpful to have a defined
relationship where you are like,

356
00:22:55,503 --> 00:22:58,624
okay,this is the person that I'm
asking advice for.There's a time

357
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:02,733
limit set.Um,so it's less
pressure,um,for someone to accept

358
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:07,419
that position.Um,And I've since
moved into,you know,the other

359
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:11,558
side where I'm mentoring.Um,
there and there,there definitely

360
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:16,088
are some benefits to having that
structured relationship.Um,but it

361
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:20,348
definitely can be a little bit of
a daunting label to put on.So

362
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:23,858
just keeping in mind that it's,
it sounds scary,but it doesn't

363
00:23:23,888 --> 00:23:27,038
have to be.It's just,you know,
cultivating a relationship with

364
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:32,344
someone.Um,and.it,it,I think it
feels transactional when you use

365
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,523
the word mentorship.Um,but that
doesn't have to be a dirty word.

366
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:40,263
Um,and you can always,even as a
mentee,you can always be sharing

367
00:23:40,263 --> 00:23:43,713
your experience.Um,you,you are
always bringing something to the

368
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:47,463
table so you can still benefit
your mentor even if,even in that,

369
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:49,624
uh,closely defined relationship.

370
00:23:51,273 --> 00:23:54,993
Bekah: Yeah.I also think like as
developers,it's important to be

371
00:23:54,993 --> 00:23:57,784
around other people of lots of
different levels,and you might

372
00:23:57,784 --> 00:24:00,844
naturally find yourself in the
role of mentor,but it also helps

373
00:24:00,844 --> 00:24:04,334
you to understand user experience
too,right?Like there are

374
00:24:04,334 --> 00:24:07,713
different.People at all different
stages.You're not always building

375
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:11,733
for somebody with,um,years of
experience and vast amounts of

376
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:15,364
knowledge.So to be able to
clearly communicate with a large,

377
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:19,773
uh,audience,I think it that makes
it kind of essential to embrace

378
00:24:19,778 --> 00:24:24,213
the idea of horizontal mentorship
and be willing to listen to other

379
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:27,304
people and to associate with
them.Otherwise,you start to get

380
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:28,413
tunnel vision.

381
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:33,753
Caitlin: Yeah,for sure.I think
it's so important for,um,anyone

382
00:24:33,753 --> 00:24:39,064
who's working in tech to have a.
Uh,to constantly have a,a

383
00:24:39,064 --> 00:24:43,324
beginner's mindset and always be
wanting to learn.So even if you

384
00:24:43,324 --> 00:24:47,374
are a,you know,a staff engineer
talking to a junior engineer,

385
00:24:47,374 --> 00:24:51,663
like to kind of have an extreme
example,like coming to that

386
00:24:51,663 --> 00:24:55,743
conversation and,and being
willing to learn something,um,I

387
00:24:55,743 --> 00:25:00,124
think is,uh,a really important
skill and really beneficial,um,

388
00:25:00,453 --> 00:25:02,733
in terms of long,long-term career
growth.

389
00:25:04,554 --> 00:25:07,513
Bekah: Yeah,I was recently on
Twitter and somebody was asking

390
00:25:07,513 --> 00:25:12,134
like,how do you even find a
mentor?I'm trying to learn,and so

391
00:25:12,403 --> 00:25:16,483
I know I,I.You probably have
thoughts on this,so,you know,if

392
00:25:16,483 --> 00:25:19,094
you were to offer that person
advice,what would it be?

393
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:23,419
Caitlin: Yeah,I definitely have
been that person before of like

394
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:26,509
desperately wanting mentors and
not knowing where to look.Um,I

395
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:30,439
think one,I mean,one starting
point is seeking out peer

396
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:33,439
mentorship.That can be a lot less
daunting.I.Or it's,it's a lot

397
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:36,828
more accessible to you.So if
you're in a bootcamp,um,you know,

398
00:25:37,189 --> 00:25:40,038
linking up with other people in
your bootcamp and kind of helping

399
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:44,104
each other out that way,um,
There's also a great talk that I

400
00:25:44,104 --> 00:25:48,874
saw,um,by,uh Kay Woo on Twitter.
Um,I can share the link

401
00:25:48,874 --> 00:25:51,903
afterwards,but she talks about
the idea of being a stealth

402
00:25:51,903 --> 00:25:56,554
mentee,um,where the person who is
your mentor doesn't have to know

403
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:59,854
they're your mentor,uh,
necessarily.Like if we broaden

404
00:25:59,854 --> 00:26:05,759
our.Um,our definition of what
mentorship is,um,it becomes a lot

405
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,209
more accessible.So if you are
just having a conversation with,

406
00:26:09,598 --> 00:26:13,769
um,for example,uh,a developer on
your team or just chatting with

407
00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:17,699
someone at a,at a conference,um,
you can learn a lot.You can ask

408
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:22,169
questions,uh,to benefit from
their experience.Um,and that's

409
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:26,009
really what mentorship is at the
end of the day.Um,you could even,

410
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:31,173
I.Kind of,it's a little bit,uh,
outside of the traditional,um,

411
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:35,013
definition of mentorship,but you
could read a blog post or watch a

412
00:26:35,013 --> 00:26:37,834
video from someone and there's
not even necessarily a direct

413
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:40,983
relationship there,but you're
still getting the benefits of

414
00:26:40,983 --> 00:26:44,314
mentorship if you're learning
from their experience.So I think,

415
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:48,604
um,Being less strict with your
definition can help you to kind

416
00:26:48,604 --> 00:26:52,864
of ease into finding different
avenues for mentorship.Um,and

417
00:26:52,864 --> 00:26:54,993
then eventually if you're
constantly seeking that out,

418
00:26:54,993 --> 00:26:57,273
you'll,you'll kind of start to
foster those relationships that

419
00:26:57,273 --> 00:27:01,894
can lead to more traditional,um,
mentorship relationships.

420
00:27:03,653 --> 00:27:06,314
Bekah: I love that so much.Uh,it
reminds me.Me,I think it was an

421
00:27:06,314 --> 00:27:11,263
Instagram story I saw with,um,
Sarah Blakely,the founder of

422
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:15,134
Spanx,and she met this woman,I
don't know,it was like at the

423
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:18,134
store.She just ran into her.The
woman was so excited.She was

424
00:27:18,134 --> 00:27:22,753
like,you are my mentor.And she
had a list of five mentors,which

425
00:27:22,753 --> 00:27:26,864
were like celebrities or people
that are prominent in their

426
00:27:26,864 --> 00:27:31,358
field.And she said that,She,
these are people that she always

427
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:35,138
listens to what they're saying.
She watches their talks,she reads

428
00:27:35,138 --> 00:27:37,989
their books or listens to their
podcasts or whatever because they

429
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,898
have so much knowledge that
they're sharing and she knows

430
00:27:40,898 --> 00:27:43,689
that she'll probably never have a
personal relationship with those

431
00:27:43,689 --> 00:27:48,338
people.But it's not,it,it's,they
are still providing her with

432
00:27:48,338 --> 00:27:51,953
mentorship.In a different way.
And so it was expanding that

433
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:56,124
definition to really glow it,
grow in that knowledge.And so it,

434
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:59,574
even if you go that far,which I
think might feel like the extreme

435
00:27:59,574 --> 00:28:03,713
opposite end,it's all about like
being open to growing and

436
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:07,884
learning from different people.
And so I really love the idea of

437
00:28:07,884 --> 00:28:11,229
just.Thinking about it in new
ways,you know,it doesn't have to

438
00:28:11,229 --> 00:28:14,709
be that one-on-one relationship.
And like,to be honest with you,I

439
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:18,969
think the,the most impactful
mentorship that I've had has been

440
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:23,919
being part of a community because
it's just like everybody,just by

441
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,769
the nature of developing
relationships,respecting each

442
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:29,769
other,trusting each other,
growing together.We all kind of

443
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:33,788
mentor each other in a way that's
really authentic.And I think when

444
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:38,888
that happens,that's for me
personally,something that is,um,

445
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:41,739
a really great experience.

446
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:46,983
Caitlin: Yeah,I totally agree.I
think like,um,networking is

447
00:28:46,983 --> 00:28:50,433
another one of those words that
sounds scary and it,it,it's like

448
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:53,824
has all this pressure associated
with it,but really it's just

449
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:57,034
forming relationships and
community.Um,and I'm really

450
00:28:57,034 --> 00:29:02,163
grateful to vc.I feel like it's
really helped me to expand,um,

451
00:29:02,364 --> 00:29:04,973
And like take off some of the
pressure of what I associated

452
00:29:04,973 --> 00:29:08,753
with networking.Um,you're just
meeting people and cultivating

453
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:13,284
relationships.Um,and that is a
much more comfortable way of

454
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:16,884
forming those kind of mentoring
relationships if you are just

455
00:29:16,884 --> 00:29:20,304
chatting with someone and getting
to know them as opposed to like

456
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:22,703
sending a cold message on
LinkedIn of like,I want to be my

457
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:25,644
mentor.Like,that's,that's a lot
of pressure if you're just

458
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:29,243
starting to get to know someone.
It's a lot more of a,of a natural

459
00:29:29,243 --> 00:29:31,044
way of forming that relationship.

460
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:34,384
Bekah: Yeah,and that can be
really hard.Uh,there's a lot of

461
00:29:34,384 --> 00:29:37,713
people that want the one-on-one
time,and I,I do feel like

462
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:41,943
sometimes there's a time and a
place for that.But group

463
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:45,933
mentorship in a lot of ways can
be more impactful because you

464
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:49,598
hear other people asking
questions.And I don't know,

465
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:51,788
there's something about that.I
think there's a couple of things.

466
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:55,778
Like one,it helps you to see,it
helps,it helped me to overcome

467
00:29:55,778 --> 00:30:00,278
imposter syndrome.Like,oh,that
person has that question too.Um,

468
00:30:00,338 --> 00:30:03,368
it also helps you to learn how to
communicate with other people

469
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,788
because you know,no matter where
you are,you're,you need to be

470
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:10,689
asking questions to learn and to
grow and what is the right way to

471
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:13,419
do that?I mean,there's no one
right way,but there are

472
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:17,288
definitely ways that are going to
help you progress and grow a lot

473
00:30:17,288 --> 00:30:22,263
more.Um,if you know how to ask
the right questions or what the

474
00:30:22,263 --> 00:30:26,223
process looks like.And so even
like group mentorship,actually

475
00:30:26,253 --> 00:30:29,104
Virtual Coffee,coffee table
groups I think are kind of a good

476
00:30:29,104 --> 00:30:32,044
example of this cuz we have
people at all different levels

477
00:30:32,044 --> 00:30:36,574
who are sharing and being part of
these groups together.And that

478
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:43,203
the um,diversity of level of
folks in those groups,I think

479
00:30:43,203 --> 00:30:46,834
allows people to learn and grow a
a lot more.

480
00:30:47,963 --> 00:30:51,114
Caitlin: Yeah,I totally agree.I
think too,another benefit of

481
00:30:51,443 --> 00:30:54,294
group mentorship as opposed to
one-on-one is that when you're

482
00:30:54,294 --> 00:30:56,784
getting one-on-one mentorship,
you always have to be aware that

483
00:30:57,443 --> 00:31:02,634
this is one person's opinion
based on their lived experience.

484
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:06,503
They might have,you know,
blinders on as to certain factors

485
00:31:06,503 --> 00:31:09,503
that might impact you,as opposed
to if you're getting,um,feedback

486
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:11,963
from a group of people,you're
getting a,a little bit more of a

487
00:31:11,963 --> 00:31:17,013
balanced,um,Perspective on your
problems.And so,um,yeah,I think

488
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:21,423
there's a ton of benefits to
getting,um,less conventional

489
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:22,653
types of mentorship.

490
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:29,699
Dan: Yeah,I'd agree with that.
And,and that's like that,uh,the

491
00:31:29,699 --> 00:31:34,138
value of like having more eyes on
a,on a thing is,is true in,in

492
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:37,378
mentorship,is true in code.It's
true in a lot of ways,you know,

493
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:42,344
and I think I.I mean,not to,you
know,pump up Virtual Coffee even

494
00:31:42,344 --> 00:31:44,804
more in our own podcast,but,you
know,it,it's,it is one of the

495
00:31:44,804 --> 00:31:47,503
like really awesome things,you
know,and when we're doing,like,

496
00:31:47,503 --> 00:31:50,594
octoberfest,right?We have people
that have never done open source

497
00:31:50,594 --> 00:31:53,773
before.We have people that are,
you know,do it for their work.

498
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:56,743
Like all involved in the same,in
the same thing.And,you know,a

499
00:31:56,743 --> 00:31:58,963
nice channel where,where people
can ask questions and all that

500
00:31:58,963 --> 00:32:01,513
stuff.And,and you're right,you
get,you get lots of different

501
00:32:01,513 --> 00:32:05,653
answers.Here's what works worked
for me.Uh,here's what worked for.

502
00:32:05,868 --> 00:32:08,989
Five other people,right?And,uh,
sometimes it's gonna be the same

503
00:32:08,989 --> 00:32:10,729
answer.You know,like sometimes
it's all just everybody's saying,

504
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:13,128
yes,that thing is,that thing is
good,that solution is the right

505
00:32:13,128 --> 00:32:16,848
one.And sometimes it's,you know,
most times in tech or career or

506
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:21,499
whatever,there's not one right
answer.And,um,the,the more,the

507
00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:23,778
more you can get,uh,you know,
there's diminishing returns,I

508
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:27,078
suppose,you know,if you ask a
question on Twitter just for

509
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,689
everybody to answer.The,the
results may vary,right.You know,

510
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:34,378
uh,but,but that's,that's the
value of having,you know,a,a

511
00:32:34,378 --> 00:32:36,719
smaller group or a smaller
community where you do know

512
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:39,298
people and you know their
histories and all that stuff.Um,

513
00:32:40,588 --> 00:32:41,398
it's,it's really good.

514
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:44,554
Caitlin: Yeah.And getting to know
those people over time too,so you

515
00:32:44,554 --> 00:32:49,054
can kind of understand.Um,It
gives you a little bit more

516
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:51,933
context,uh,for where they're
coming from as opposed to like,

517
00:32:51,993 --> 00:32:55,203
you know,going on Stack Overflow
is not the same as going to like

518
00:32:55,203 --> 00:32:59,074
a VC group and asking a question.
Um,it's a lot more,um,of a

519
00:32:59,074 --> 00:33:03,634
personalized experience.So,yeah,
I,I think it's finding those

520
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:10,413
communities,um,can really help
you to,to develop that kind of a,

521
00:33:10,743 --> 00:33:11,344
a rapport.

522
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:17,019
Dan: Yeah.And the,the over time
aspect of it I think is,is one of

523
00:33:17,023 --> 00:33:20,548
the big,is one of the big.Pieces
of this,right?And,and this is

524
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:24,179
true even with,uh,single mentor,
you know,mentee relationship,is

525
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:27,538
that I think the value of it will
increase over time,right?Uh,

526
00:33:27,568 --> 00:33:31,828
because you both know more about
each other.Um,and the same with

527
00:33:31,828 --> 00:33:33,838
groups and things like that.I,
and I think this is probably a

528
00:33:33,838 --> 00:33:38,038
good value of,uh,collab lab too,
right?Is is it's,it's not just a

529
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:41,679
one time thing or,or random
groups.I mean,I suppose it.I

530
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,628
don't know.I don't know how they
choose,you know who the groups

531
00:33:43,628 --> 00:33:45,548
are,but the groups are small.
Right?And then it's the same

532
00:33:45,548 --> 00:33:48,098
group for eight,eight weeks.Is
that what it is?

533
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:49,548
Caitlin: Yeah,it's eight weeks.
Yep.

534
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,209
Dan: right.Yeah.And so you,you
end up learning the same thing,

535
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:55,209
uh,the same kinds of things about
the people in the group over,or I

536
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:58,148
would imagine,anyway.I've not,
I've never done it.But it seems

537
00:33:58,148 --> 00:34:00,878
like that that would be a value
of that,of that kind of group

538
00:34:00,878 --> 00:34:05,499
too.Um,is over time,you know,
you,you develop those connections

539
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:09,338
and the,the,the answers become
more specific,you know,uh,and

540
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:12,103
things like that.Um,Yeah.I,I

541
00:34:12,213 --> 00:34:12,543
Caitlin: with that.

542
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:15,313
Dan: yeah.Yeah.I,I,I actually
like speaking of collab lab,I was

543
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:17,114
wondering if you could talk a
little bit more just about,

544
00:34:17,324 --> 00:34:21,043
specifically about the
experience,um,as a mentor,cuz you

545
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:23,083
were a mentor.How many times have
you

546
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:29,059
Caitlin: I've mentored.Yeah,so
I've mentored,um,a few times in a

547
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:33,003
few different ways.So there's.
Two main ways that I've mentored,

548
00:34:33,063 --> 00:34:36,844
um,as a project mentor,which is,
uh,what you're describing where

549
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:39,784
there's eight weeks and you're
paired with a small team.Um,we

550
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:44,224
also have,um,mentors that work
with our,um,career lab program.

551
00:34:44,494 --> 00:34:48,634
Um,and so that is short,a
shorter,um,period of time and

552
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,224
more focused on helping someone
to develop,um,either their mock

553
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:57,844
interview or their job interview
skills,um,or their LinkedIn,um,

554
00:34:57,844 --> 00:35:01,833
and things like that.Um,And so
those are pretty different types

555
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:06,994
of,uh,relationships there.The,
the career lab is a shorter term,

556
00:35:07,384 --> 00:35:10,684
uh,relationship with a more
focused goal of,you know,

557
00:35:10,684 --> 00:35:16,443
developing this one part of
someone's,um,job hunting package.

558
00:35:16,684 --> 00:35:17,313
Um,

559
00:35:17,414 --> 00:35:19,213
Dan: just,is that one on one or?

560
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:23,434
Caitlin: Yeah.Yeah.So,so there
is,there's kind of a group,

561
00:35:23,463 --> 00:35:26,733
there's a cohort that goes
through career lab.Um,and then,

562
00:35:26,853 --> 00:35:30,094
uh,each person is paired with a
few different mentors to help

563
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:34,503
them with a few different pieces
of their,um,job hunting package.

564
00:35:34,503 --> 00:35:39,003
So they might be paired with one
person for a mock,uh,behavioral

565
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:42,153
interview,another for a mock
technical interview,and another

566
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:45,693
for reviewing their LinkedIn,uh,
materials,which again,like you're

567
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:47,989
getting different.They're
focusing on different things,but

568
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:50,539
you're still getting three
different people's perspectives

569
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:54,228
and they might have different
advice to give you.Um,so it's,

570
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:59,119
it's beneficial in that way.Um,
and then,so the other,uh,type of,

571
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:04,248
uh,mentorship,uh,that I've gotten
to take part in is the project

572
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:11,179
mentor.Um,and that too,uh,we have
four collabs,four developers,and

573
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:15,454
then three mentors that are
paired that are,um,Grouped with

574
00:36:15,454 --> 00:36:19,833
them.Um,and so again,you're
getting to benefit from multiple

575
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:22,893
people's experiences and getting
to kind of distill that

576
00:36:22,893 --> 00:36:27,003
information into what works for
you.Um,and that is,uh,over eight

577
00:36:27,009 --> 00:36:29,403
weeks.So you've got a little bit
of time to develop re

578
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:33,003
relationships with them.Um,you
can interact with them in a group

579
00:36:33,003 --> 00:36:35,764
setting with the rest of your
team.Um,sometimes we'll have

580
00:36:35,764 --> 00:36:39,213
office hours so you can kind of
talk one-on-one or ask questions.

581
00:36:39,514 --> 00:36:45,063
Um,and so I,I,I value both types
of,uh,relationships,but.It is

582
00:36:45,063 --> 00:36:48,784
really nice to get to see someone
over time.Um,you know,thinking

583
00:36:48,784 --> 00:36:51,693
from the perspective of a mentor.
They,they wanna help you,they

584
00:36:51,693 --> 00:36:54,184
wanna see you growing,so it's
kind of nice to have a longer

585
00:36:54,184 --> 00:36:57,784
term relationship and get to see,
um,how you're growing and

586
00:36:57,784 --> 00:37:01,204
developing.Um,you know,hopefully
from the benefit of their advice.

587
00:37:03,494 --> 00:37:06,074
Dan: It sounds really awesome.It
sounds really valuable from both

588
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,103
sides.Like it sounds valuable as
a,as a mentee,somebody learning,

589
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:12,224
you know,but also,I mean,I mean,
maybe you could speak to this,

590
00:37:12,224 --> 00:37:17,474
but it sounds like very valuable,
uh,as a,as a mentor,um,to,I don't

591
00:37:17,474 --> 00:37:20,143
know,to,to learn from other
people and,and practice this kind

592
00:37:20,143 --> 00:37:22,708
of thing.Um,It just seems like a
cool project,so

593
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:26,088
Caitlin: Yeah,totally.I think
it's good to keep in mind for

594
00:37:26,088 --> 00:37:30,858
mentees too,that you know,like
what is the benefit to my mentor

595
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:34,159
for this?It's probably they,they
feel good about helping you and

596
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,369
they wanna see you develop.And
so,uh,one thing you can do to be

597
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:40,849
a good mentee is to demonstrate
that,like show them,Hey,I

598
00:37:40,853 --> 00:37:44,148
followed up on this advice and,
and it really worked for me.Or,

599
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:47,028
you know,I followed up on your
advice and I'm still struggling

600
00:37:47,028 --> 00:37:50,059
with it.Maybe we can follow up.
Um,thinking about that as a

601
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,208
mentee can help you to develop
even better relationships with

602
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:53,958
your mentor.

603
00:37:55,293 --> 00:37:57,454
Bekah: I love that.I don't think
I've ever heard that advice given

604
00:37:57,454 --> 00:38:00,094
before,but I think that's a
really great way to look at it.

605
00:38:00,574 --> 00:38:03,664
Um,one of the challenges that I
see in mentor-mentee

606
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:07,503
relationships sometimes is that
I.The mentee becomes too

607
00:38:07,503 --> 00:38:11,253
dependent on the mentor.And so
rather than spending that,

608
00:38:11,284 --> 00:38:14,764
spending extra time,it's just
kind of like the knee jerk

609
00:38:14,764 --> 00:38:18,273
reaction to like,I'm stuck,I've
gotta ask my mentor.And then just

610
00:38:18,273 --> 00:38:23,434
that continued behavior,um,which
makes it hard for them to grow,

611
00:38:23,494 --> 00:38:27,423
right?Like to separate themselves
from that relationship.And I

612
00:38:27,423 --> 00:38:32,298
think it's also challenging as a
mentor.To identify that and to

613
00:38:32,298 --> 00:38:35,809
kind of like guide them in the
right direction when you see that

614
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:38,329
happening.I don't know if you
have any thoughts on that or

615
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:41,929
advice,but I,I think that that
gets a little tricky.

616
00:38:42,824 --> 00:38:47,804
Caitlin: Yeah,for sure.Um,and I,
I can relate as someone who

617
00:38:48,074 --> 00:38:50,713
doesn't,you know,sometimes hasn't
always had confidence and just

618
00:38:50,713 --> 00:38:53,083
wants to ask someone for help,
um,I think that's a really

619
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:57,289
natural thing.Um,As a mentor,
something that you can do for

620
00:38:57,289 --> 00:39:02,329
that is maybe leaning more
towards coaching than mentoring.

621
00:39:02,628 --> 00:39:07,039
Um,so mentoring is generally when
you're giving someone advice

622
00:39:07,068 --> 00:39:10,969
based on your own experience,um,
and,and just kind of letting them

623
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:14,659
use that to help solve their
problems.Uh,whereas coaching can

624
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:17,923
sometimes be differentiated
where.It's a little bit closer to

625
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:22,034
teaching where you're asking
questions to help someone come to

626
00:39:22,034 --> 00:39:26,594
their own conclusions.Um,and so,
you know,if someone's asking you

627
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:30,164
like,how do I solve this problem?
Instead of just being like,well,

628
00:39:30,164 --> 00:39:32,773
this is what I did in the past.
You could lean more towards

629
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:37,003
asking questions like,well,uh,
what kind of documentation do we

630
00:39:37,003 --> 00:39:41,523
think we should look for?Or,you
know,like,what,um,What are some

631
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:44,884
keywords we can search for online
to help us find a problem?Is

632
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:48,664
there a stack trace we can use
to,you know,start from there and,

633
00:39:48,664 --> 00:39:52,833
and follow up?So,um,asking
questions is a really good way to

634
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:56,614
help kind of take off some of
those training wheels and help

635
00:39:56,614 --> 00:40:00,153
someone to start to find their
own answers to the questions so

636
00:40:00,153 --> 00:40:03,634
that they're able to kind of
exercise those skills even when

637
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:04,293
you're not there.

638
00:40:05,115 --> 00:40:07,846
Dan: I agree.I,I was just gonna
say,I,I love that advice and you

639
00:40:07,846 --> 00:40:12,306
know,it's like even,um,From a
parenting perspective,right?I

640
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:15,335
have,you know,young kids and
it's,it's the same kind of thing.

641
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,646
It's,they asks the same question
over and over again,you know,

642
00:40:18,186 --> 00:40:22,206
and,um,trying to pro provide for
them,uh,the tools to figure the

643
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,896
answer out themselves,uh,
although more complicated and

644
00:40:25,896 --> 00:40:28,775
takes a little more effort,uh,
you know,in the initial stages,

645
00:40:28,806 --> 00:40:34,356
um,can yeah.Pay a lot of
dividends,uh,in the end.So it

646
00:40:34,356 --> 00:40:38,925
just made me think,yeah.Ben,you
know,you know where to find out

647
00:40:38,925 --> 00:40:41,655
what's for dinner.We,we write it
down on the fridge.Go,go look at

648
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:44,416
it.Don't yell at me from the
couch.What's for dinner?

649
00:40:47,661 --> 00:40:50,481
Caitlin: Yeah,I'm sure as a
parent you have those skills down

650
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:54,411
pat.Like if you're dealing with
someone who has,you know,has

651
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:58,070
learned the life skills,it's way
easy to just point them towards

652
00:40:58,521 --> 00:40:58,971
just Google it.

653
00:41:00,346 --> 00:41:02,896
Dan: Right.How would you find
that information out

654
00:41:02,931 --> 00:41:08,900
Bekah: ask Alexa.I need someone
to check my math homework.Alexa

655
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:17,481
will check your math homework.
Um,oh wait,I,I had an another

656
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:21,440
question that I don't know.I feel
like this is a tricky topic too.

657
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:26,240
Um,we see a lot of people in job
situations who are forced to

658
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,735
mentor,like,You are a senior
developer,you must mentor this

659
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:33,376
junior developer because that's
what senior developers have to

660
00:41:33,376 --> 00:41:37,905
do.And I think,I think that
mentorship is a skill that needs

661
00:41:38,085 --> 00:41:42,315
to be developed,and some people
are better at it than other

662
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,976
people.And I don't know that I
necessarily agree with the idea

663
00:41:45,976 --> 00:41:49,190
that.Everybody should be a
mentor.Like we all have our

664
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:53,811
strengths and weaknesses,things
that bring us joy and energy.And

665
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,440
so I don't know what your
thoughts are on that and I feel

666
00:41:57,445 --> 00:41:59,960
like I kind of put you on the
spot here a little bit with that

667
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,681
question.Um,but I think that it's
good to kind of have this

668
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:06,621
conversation since it's
definitely something that we've

669
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:08,570
heard over and over at Virtual
Coffee.

670
00:42:09,635 --> 00:42:13,610
Caitlin: Yeah,for sure.I totally
agree that.It's not a great

671
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,190
starting point.If someone is
feeling forced into a

672
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,820
relationship with someone,that
other person is often probably

673
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,641
gonna feel like a burden,like
they're not wanted and,and not

674
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:28,550
really feel comfortable seeking
out mentorship.Um,I,I think it is

675
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,150
a complicated issue.Um,I totally
agree that there are skills that

676
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:36,456
you need to learn to be a good
mentor.Um,and I think that,It's

677
00:42:36,456 --> 00:42:40,295
good for there to be an
expectation that more experienced

678
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:43,715
people on a team should be
mentoring,um,less experienced

679
00:42:43,715 --> 00:42:49,835
people.But I think that really.
This is a,a,a kind of lofty goal,

680
00:42:49,835 --> 00:42:52,956
but as an industry,we need to
really value those skills that

681
00:42:52,956 --> 00:42:56,436
are important for mentoring.If we
think that a senior developer

682
00:42:56,436 --> 00:42:59,135
should be mentoring,then we
should be valuing the skills that

683
00:42:59,135 --> 00:43:02,346
help them to be a good mentor.
And those should be important for

684
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,925
someone to be demonstrating
before they're getting those

685
00:43:04,925 --> 00:43:07,896
promotions where they're going to
have to serve as a mentor to

686
00:43:07,896 --> 00:43:12,516
someone.So,you know,valuing those
collaborative skills,um,you know,

687
00:43:12,516 --> 00:43:18,545
being able to,um,see someone.
Having an ability to teach other

688
00:43:18,545 --> 00:43:21,576
people if they're not
demonstrating it,their manager

689
00:43:21,576 --> 00:43:24,005
should be helping them to develop
those skills before they get to

690
00:43:24,005 --> 00:43:27,485
the point of being the like
person forced into mentorship.

691
00:43:27,516 --> 00:43:31,655
Um,so that's,I mean,that's kind
of like easier said than done.

692
00:43:31,835 --> 00:43:35,226
Um,if someone is finding themself
in a position of being forced to

693
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:38,820
mentor,um,there's lots of great.
Resources out there where you can

694
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,340
learn those skills because it is,
it,it is a skill that can be

695
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,951
learned,um,you know,if you're
going to like lead dev or

696
00:43:43,951 --> 00:43:48,990
something like that.And,um,
really prioritizing those skills

697
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:53,311
because it's,if you want to have
a functioning team,you need to

698
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:57,661
have people who are continuing to
grow.And so it is,um,kind of

699
00:43:57,661 --> 00:44:02,226
important for managers and other
people like that to.To put their

700
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:04,925
money where their mouth is and
value,um,those skills.And if

701
00:44:04,925 --> 00:44:09,186
someone isn't demonstrating it to
like invest in teaching them

702
00:44:09,186 --> 00:44:09,365
skills.

703
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:14,438
Bekah: I think that's super
important and something that's

704
00:44:14,438 --> 00:44:17,768
overlooked.I don't know why it's
so overlooked.I think it's like

705
00:44:17,768 --> 00:44:21,849
similar to that idea where people
just kind of max out and they

706
00:44:21,938 --> 00:44:25,539
throw'em as a manager,like,okay,
you've reached a skill level,now

707
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:30,728
you're a manager.And that,that's
a different skill set and I,I

708
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:34,869
think it just needs to be
recognized that.Hey,like people

709
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:38,889
are good at different things.We
just need to make sure that if

710
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:41,588
this is the path that we're
sending them on,that we equip

711
00:44:41,588 --> 00:44:44,739
them to do that.And I don't think
it should be an expectation that

712
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:50,679
every senior plus developer knows
how to mentor.Um,and in fact,

713
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:55,088
like some of them were not
mentored in.Anyway,uh,there have

714
00:44:55,088 --> 00:44:57,849
definitely been people who have
had those experiences,which makes

715
00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:01,869
it even more challenging for them
to learn and grow.And also,like,

716
00:45:02,259 --> 00:45:05,559
you gotta evaluate,is this,is
this the best person to mentor?

717
00:45:05,563 --> 00:45:08,918
Because that idea that you talked
about before in peer-to-peer

718
00:45:08,918 --> 00:45:14,048
mentoring,I think that,you know
that you can,it,I think it's

719
00:45:14,054 --> 00:45:17,858
possible to have a junior
developer mentor,another junior

720
00:45:17,858 --> 00:45:21,264
developer.It's just about like,
Looking at those skill sets,

721
00:45:21,534 --> 00:45:24,864
looking at the communication
skills and the collaboration and

722
00:45:25,103 --> 00:45:29,184
does this make sense?And,you
know,then maybe providing some

723
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:32,724
upper level support if there are
questions.But I,I think that it

724
00:45:32,724 --> 00:45:36,594
does come down to like evaluating
that,that side of things.

725
00:45:38,054 --> 00:45:40,884
Caitlin: Yeah,I totally agree.
Yeah,it exactly like you said,

726
00:45:40,884 --> 00:45:44,153
it's sometimes people.People
shouldn't be a manager or

727
00:45:44,153 --> 00:45:47,483
shouldn't be a mentor.Um,or maybe
not that they shouldn't be,but

728
00:45:47,483 --> 00:45:51,264
they're not ready yet.Uh,and need
to be prepared for that kind of,

729
00:45:51,594 --> 00:45:55,704
um,shift cuz it's totally
different position than what they

730
00:45:55,733 --> 00:45:58,824
have been doing before,what
they've been evaluated on before.

731
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,123
And you can't just say,oh well,
like this person's good at

732
00:46:02,123 --> 00:46:05,094
juggling,so let's go make them a
lion tamer.Like that doesn't make

733
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:09,503
any sense.Um,you need to evaluate
the skills needed to do a job.

734
00:46:09,503 --> 00:46:09,563
Yeah.

735
00:46:12,204 --> 00:46:16,134
Bekah: Okay.Before we go,
Caitlyn,I've got one last

736
00:46:16,134 --> 00:46:19,983
question for you.I'm just trying
to pick what is the right one.

737
00:46:21,688 --> 00:46:24,237
We'll end on a positive note cuz
my other question was a little

738
00:46:24,237 --> 00:46:30,867
bit negative.Um,uh,what are some
tips or,uh,some bits of advice

739
00:46:30,867 --> 00:46:35,307
that you have for mentors to be
able to help their mentees kind

740
00:46:35,307 --> 00:46:38,538
of level up setting,whether
that's setting career goals,

741
00:46:39,418 --> 00:46:42,507
learning something new,or landing
that first job.

742
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:51,597
Caitlin: Ooh,good question.Um,so
I think two things I'll say.One

743
00:46:51,597 --> 00:46:57,943
is that,um,if you're a mentor,
really I.Try to put a lot of

744
00:46:57,943 --> 00:47:01,663
energy into listening to the
mentee before you're jumping in

745
00:47:01,663 --> 00:47:04,512
and like giving them advice.Make
sure you're listening to the

746
00:47:04,512 --> 00:47:07,842
problems that they're actually
wanting to solve,um,and not just

747
00:47:07,842 --> 00:47:10,992
assuming that they want to do the
exact same thing that you've

748
00:47:10,992 --> 00:47:15,282
done.Uh,because I think we all
have experience,uh,giving or

749
00:47:15,282 --> 00:47:19,362
receiving unwanted advice,and
it's not,you know,it,it's not

750
00:47:19,362 --> 00:47:21,523
really helpful to anyone.So
making sure that you are

751
00:47:21,523 --> 00:47:26,833
understanding what kind of advice
someone wants,um,before you.Jump

752
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:32,143
into providing feedback.The other
thing I'll say is that,um,again,

753
00:47:33,193 --> 00:47:38,563
try not to think of mentorship as
this huge thing,like this huge

754
00:47:38,568 --> 00:47:43,963
responsibility of like a huge
commitment.Um,it can be a lot

755
00:47:43,963 --> 00:47:47,143
more manageable if you break it
down.You can,you can really help

756
00:47:47,143 --> 00:47:52,632
someone.Um,By,you know,thinking,
identifying a small problem that

757
00:47:52,632 --> 00:47:56,413
they're having and giving them
advice to solve that problem,um,

758
00:47:57,492 --> 00:48:00,313
can be just as beneficial as,as
finding a big problem and,and

759
00:48:00,313 --> 00:48:04,302
helping them work through it,
like whatever your capacity is.

760
00:48:04,302 --> 00:48:09,507
Finding ways of helping people,I
think is,um,Just start there.

761
00:48:10,228 --> 00:48:13,228
And,um,yeah,whether it's
mentorship or sponsorship as

762
00:48:13,228 --> 00:48:16,768
well,you can also,um,be really
helpful in like,providing

763
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:20,967
opportunities for people.Um,or,
you know,like opening a door for

764
00:48:20,967 --> 00:48:27,228
someone.Um,try not to think of it
as a huge undertaking.Try and

765
00:48:27,233 --> 00:48:30,943
just start with baby steps
because that's,uh,A more

766
00:48:31,603 --> 00:48:35,353
approachable way of,um,getting
into mentoring and it's,it's

767
00:48:35,353 --> 00:48:37,273
really gonna help someone.If
you're anything is better than

768
00:48:37,273 --> 00:48:42,492
nothing,well usually,uh,any
giving,giving help,uh,whether

769
00:48:42,498 --> 00:48:48,853

help benefit someone,but be

770
00:48:48,853 --> 00:48:49,422
