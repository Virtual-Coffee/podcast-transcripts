00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:18,711
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:21,562
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:24,231
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:26,661
stories and what they've learned.
And we're here to share it with

7
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:29,262
you here with me. Today is my
co-host Dan.

8
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:35,767
Dan: Hello. Today, we had a
really, a really fun episode. We

9
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:40,476
sat down with Matt McInnis. Um,
he is a, I dunno, a data

10
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:44,826
scientist, a full-stack engineer,
a founder, um, used to be a math

11
00:00:44,826 --> 00:00:48,216
professor. Uh, he, he had a real,
he has had a very interesting

12
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:51,667
journey and a very interesting
career. So it was very cool to

13
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:57,156
hear his. Can I just say very, a
couple more times? Uh, I'm

14
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:59,887
excited though. It was, it was,
it was a fun time to sit down

15
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:03,962
with Matt. Um, I don't know he's
had a cool career and, uh,

16
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:08,311
somebody at different things he's
gotten gotten into, um, and he's

17
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:12,061
built a lot of different things
and it was fun. It was a fun

18
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:12,602
conversation.

19
00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:15,581
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, his
journey is super interesting

20
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:21,432
going from math professor to
working at some really big tech

21
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:26,292
places and talking about how he
got those jobs by building things

22
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:30,072
that were useful to him, I felt
like was super inspiring to

23
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:33,701
anybody. Who's trying to break
into tech, but just to see how

24
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:37,001
he's developed his career and
followed his interest is really,

25
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,792
uh, I don't know, inspiring, I
guess.

26
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:43,811
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. And it hit
home for me a lot. Uh it's it's

27
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:45,641
one of those things that I, I
never did consciously, and I

28
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:48,912
don't think Matt did really
either. He, he was, he would

29
00:01:48,912 --> 00:01:51,522
build things that would help him,
you know, help himself. So he

30
00:01:51,522 --> 00:01:54,611
talked about, uh, what he built
something that was like helping

31
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:59,272
to buy tickets or sell tickets
and, um, It wasn't like a scheme

32
00:01:59,272 --> 00:02:02,932
to make money or a scheme to get
a job. You know, it was just a

33
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:06,471
thing that helped him, his, his
own like life, you know, it

34
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:10,671
wasn't trying to sell the product
or, um, do any of the things that

35
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:14,301
you hear about these days a lot?
Um, he just was like interested

36
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,752
in built something and then some
people heard about it. Um, and

37
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:22,162
well, you'll hear about the rest,
but, uh, it was cool. It hit home

38
00:02:22,162 --> 00:02:25,792
for me. I, I that's building
projects is like, that's always,

39
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:29,062
my advice to people too, is, is
just build things that you're

40
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:32,451
either interested in or could
help yourself. Um, and the rest

41
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:35,961
will come sort of naturally. So
it was, it was cool. It was, we

42
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:37,671
had a good time talking to him.

43
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:41,752
Bekah: Yeah, it was fascinating
episode. Um, and we hope that you

44
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:44,692
enjoy it and we're going to start
it the same way that we start

45
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:48,622
every Virtual Coffee with our
names where we're from, what we

46
00:02:48,622 --> 00:03:00,127
do and our random check-in
question. So enjoy. Today's

47
00:03:00,152 --> 00:03:03,842
random check-in question is if
you could appear on any game

48
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:08,853
show, what would it be? I'm
Bekah. I am a technical community

49
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:17,462
builder from a small town in Ohio
and show. I don't know if there

50
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:21,423
was a Sudoku game show. I would
like to try that. I don't think

51
00:03:21,423 --> 00:03:26,638
that's a thing. So I guess I'll
go on wheel of fortune. Or I

52
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:29,638
don't know prices. Right. I feel
like I'm, as an adult, I've

53
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:35,518
gotten better at that. Like, oh,
I know the price of that. Um, but

54
00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:38,038
I dunno, I think I'll stick with
wheel of fortune.

55
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:42,328
Dan: of Fortune it seemed like a
fun, a fun time. You know, I

56
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:43,348
Bekah: so stressful.

57
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:48,388
Dan: I feel like a Sudoku game
show be boring to watch. It might

58
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:50,818
be fun to compete. fun to compete
in, but, uh,

59
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:53,298
Bekah: There's like some kind of
obstacles they throw in, right?

60
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:58,668
Like once you in one row, then
something happened and you get

61
00:03:58,668 --> 00:04:02,807
slimed. Do you ever watch double
dare?

62
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:08,652
Dan: Oh, man. Um, okay, so hi,
I'm Dan. I do a front end

63
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:13,252
development, mostly and,
Cleveland and. Um, uh, yeah,

64
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,723
yeah, it game show, uh, American
Gladiators is the first thing

65
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,382
that popped into my head. Uh,

66
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:18,617
Bekah: it back. That's what I'm
doing.

67
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:22,622
Dan: I, uh, always wanted to do,
especially the one, the like

68
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:25,083
thing. I feel like they ended
with it, but the one where you

69
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:28,533
run around shooting the, like the
Nerf guns at the, you know, and

70
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:31,262
the, like the gladiator person is
up on the top shooting, Nerf gun

71
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:33,543
stuff at you or tennis balls. I
don't really know. I haven't

72
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:34,862
watched it obviously in a long
time, but.

73
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:37,038
Bekah: ninja warrior two. I
forgot.

74
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:40,382
Dan: American ninja warrior is
cool. a lot harder though, but it

75
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:43,293
would be to try. I would
definitely try that for sure.

76
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:45,302
Matt: a contestant or one of on

77
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:47,252
Dan: when we now have to start,
I'd have to start as a

78
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:49,892
contestant, you know, I can't,
I'm not going to just like swoop

79
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:52,773
in and, you know, I gotta, I
gotta earn my, earn my way up.

80
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:59,552
Right. Uh, but yeah, I feel like,
uh, plus it, get the will, did

81
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:03,182
the contestants have the, um, you
call them? Like a, not a

82
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:07,862
jumpsuit, but the, uh, we things.
Or like that wrestlers. So,

83
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:10,533
Matt: I think it's the jumps. Now
there's a name for it. Isn't

84
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:10,733
that?

85
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:14,702
Dan: Was the thing that need,
Nick was the thing that like

86
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:19,052
wrestlers were, uh, like, like
you single it, maybe. I don't

87
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:19,262
know.

88
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:22,757
Matt: another word for it, but
it's not leotards, is it? No.

89
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:25,713
Dan: mean, it's basically
leotard, but it's like sleeve

90
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:26,072
list.

91
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,583
Bekah: it is what you were
wrestling.

92
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:30,002
Dan: don't know. I don't know
doesn't sound right, but you're

93
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:33,192
probably right. We'll ask Nick
after, after the F.

94
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,588
Matt: I'm a, it's good to be
here, guys. Thank you for having

95
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:42,048
me. I'm Matt. I'm a developer
from Toronto, Canada. I run a

96
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:45,077
small company called Typist where
we make educational software and

97
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:48,497
um, if I was on one game, so my
first, you know, American

98
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:51,197
Gladiator wins, but my first
reaction was Kid's Street. It's

99
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:54,528
this old game show. I don't know
if I like, if I was 12 years old

100
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:56,898
again, think it, you know, and
everyone kind of clapped over

101
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,747
their head. Like there is this
like thing that they did if they

102
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:03,348
got a question, right. And if you
want. It was like every kid's to

103
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:07,367
go into like this middle platform
was like stalked, like a toy

104
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,788
store. And you had like two
minutes to just grab whatever you

105
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:14,447
wanted. It was like, yeah. So my
sisters and I, we would watch

106
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,028
kids stream and be like, how do
we get on this TV show? And we

107
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:20,418
never quite cracked the egg on
that one. It was very

108
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:24,737
disappointing childhood, I guess
you could say I'm kidding, but

109
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:29,007
it's a kid's dream, but you know,
also the second dance answer,

110
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:29,427
cause that sounds.

111
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:33,348
Bekah: wow. I have never seen
kids street before.

112
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:36,747
Matt: Yeah, there's this funny
kind of Canadian, you know, from

113
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:40,468
Canada, there's this funny
Canadian subculture around some

114
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:43,798
things like there are these
really kind of weird things that

115
00:06:43,798 --> 00:06:46,648
pop up every now and then that
are extremely popular. Like

116
00:06:46,648 --> 00:06:49,247
household, everybody knows them,
even like music and bands

117
00:06:49,247 --> 00:06:52,468
sometimes, um, there were fueled
by this entertainment industry

118
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:54,507
that like out of Toronto, but
like these companies called much

119
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:57,358
music and they're related
subsidiaries, but are just

120
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:59,728
totally unknown in the U S and
it, which is funny because the us

121
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:02,932
is a two hour drive from where
I'm living. Close, right? Like

122
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:06,413
we're we're right there. We go to
Buffalo bills games all the time.

123
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:08,273
It's across the, you know, it
feels like it's across the

124
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:10,733
street, but go down there and
you're like, oh, they tragically

125
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,973
hit. And it like, every, like,
you know, half of Canada is all

126
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:16,642
time favorite band and people in
the U S are like, who? Like, who

127
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:19,853
is that? You know, it's, there's
these things. So kids dream might

128
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:23,273
be one of them too. And, uh, you
know, all these like kind of old

129
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:24,262
TV shows for kids.

130
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:29,072
Bekah: Yeah, I need check it out.
I pulled up the, oh, it is a

131
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:32,853
Canadian's children's game show.
So

132
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:36,757
Matt: I, ah, you guys missed out,
this was epic, like, and it would

133
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,338
have been like, it would've been
way better if the us had done it,

134
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:45,427
the mall would have been cooler.
Like production quality would

135
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:47,557
have been way up there. Like
where's Nickelodeon

136
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:48,663
Bekah: yeah.

137
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,327
Matt: for kids street.

138
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:52,067
Bekah: I love it. It looks very
eighties. I need to check this

139
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:52,338
out.

140
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:54,048
Matt: Yeah, it was cool.

141
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,827
Bekah: Well, thanks so much for
being here with us today, Matt,

142
00:07:57,858 --> 00:08:02,208
we always like to get started
with your origin stories. So if

143
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:07,517
you could give us what the story
is that brought you here to

144
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:08,838
today, where you are in tech.

145
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:13,228
Matt: Yeah. Thanks. Thank you for
having me, Dan and Bekah. Um,

146
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:17,802
yeah. I guess like starting,
focusing on the tech side of

147
00:08:17,802 --> 00:08:21,973
things, I, you know, graduated,
uh, I did degrees in math. I love

148
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:27,312
math. Uh, I think it's still my
Twitter. Uh, and, uh, and you

149
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:29,502
know, I went, I decided that like
the change I wanted to make in

150
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:31,663
the world after graduating was I
wanted to improve the way that

151
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:34,543
people learn mathematics at the
post-secondary level. I just, you

152
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:38,577
know, my programs that I took
were massacre. Such few people

153
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:42,148
finish relative to how many
started. And, uh, and I worked

154
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:44,398
all the way through university
and math help centers. And as a

155
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:48,298
TA and I saw people in non-math
disciplines kind of drop out of

156
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:50,368
their like early childhood
education program because they

157
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:53,927
couldn't complete their stats
course. And I thought that. Crazy

158
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:56,538
because if it's taught properly,
I don't think math is hard. Uh,

159
00:08:56,748 --> 00:09:01,128
you know, put that strong caveat
if it's taught properly. And so I

160
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:03,947
really wanted to kind of affect
change there. I took a job. Uh, I

161
00:09:03,947 --> 00:09:06,977
applied everywhere for these, uh,
in Canada. We call them math

162
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:10,638
professorships at community
colleges in Canada and the U S

163
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:13,577
it's probably known as a math
instructor, uh, at the community

164
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:16,682
in the community college system.
And. So I took a job, uh, in

165
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:19,923
Saskatchewan. I moved from the
small town Aurora, Ontario, where

166
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:23,852
I grew up to, uh, prince Albert,
Saskatchewan, which is 40,000

167
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:27,663
person town, like in the, you
know, it was really awesome. I

168
00:09:27,663 --> 00:09:31,038
loved it out there and I had some
family there too. And that's

169
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:34,697
where, you know, I guess my
journey to tech started, I, um,

170
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,947
you know, I was a math person. I
really had no experience with

171
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:41,597
tech at that point. I was, you
know, 24 and 23, 24. And, um, and

172
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:46,697
I, I just started wanting to make
things. Um, I remember the first

173
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:50,177
thing I wanted to make was I had
read a book that's now very

174
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:53,717
popular Malcolm Gladwell's
tipping point. And he described

175
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:56,087
like Sesame street in the
eighties and how they would like.

176
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,273
Engineer this TV show, they would
bring kids in and they would put

177
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:01,643
Sesame street on one screen. And
this thing called the distractor

178
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:05,182
on the other screen. And, uh,
every seven seconds, this

179
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:07,793
distractor would display these
still images that would switch.

180
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:10,283
So every seven seconds, a
different image. And you'd put

181
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:12,773
like 20 kids in the room and the
researchers would just look at

182
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:14,692
their eyes and be like, are they
looking at the distractor? Are

183
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:17,243
they looking at Sesame street?
And then they would go back and

184
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:19,523
they'd graph it after they'd
done, like a couple of cycles of

185
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:22,072
kids. And they'd see what are the
parts of the TV show that kids

186
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:25,832
were disengaged with, that we
need to re. And that was like the

187
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,543
first thing I was like, man, if
they could do that in the

188
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,633
eighties, why can't like in, you
know, this was, I guess like

189
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,932
2010. I'm like, why can't we do
that? Like in real time live

190
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:37,008
while I'm teaching in class. And
that was my first project was I

191
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:40,427
wanted to build something that
did that. And I had learned that

192
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:43,217
Hasbro had put out this toy
called the high, like the star

193
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:47,388
wars force trainer. Very
predictable story. We'd have like

194
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:50,087
a headset that you'd put on and
it turns out this thing could

195
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:54,587
actually take a, like a low level
EEG reading of brain activity. If

196
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:58,293
your brain was active or not. And
then like the toy would connect

197
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:02,013
wirelessly to this base unit that
had a fan that would spin a ball

198
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:04,952
up and down in this toy. And so
it like, hence the fourth

199
00:11:04,952 --> 00:11:07,263
strainer is you concentrate
really hard and you can use the

200
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:11,793
force to move this ball, like
really cool toy. Right. And I

201
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:13,893
said, well, if I could just get
the electrical signal out of that

202
00:11:13,893 --> 00:11:16,503
and into my computer and graph
it, that would be the whole

203
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:20,283
thing. And that was my first
foray into tech. was I like

204
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:22,952
started. It was like, okay, well,
how do I get the electrical

205
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:26,673
signal out? And how does, how
does electricity work and how

206
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:29,942
does circuits work? And, uh, you
know, I learned about

207
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:32,582
microprocessors and the Arduino
had to like just come out at the

208
00:11:32,582 --> 00:11:37,202
time. And so I started like
getting these, like I found that

209
00:11:37,202 --> 00:11:39,302
kids' books for Arduino actually
way better than the ones that are

210
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:41,793
making for adults. So I like got
all these like kids' books and

211
00:11:42,212 --> 00:11:45,552
started like doing these
experiments. And then I. You

212
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:48,192
know, these wires solder. So I'd
go down to the electrical

213
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:50,383
department and be like, Hey guy,
I was teaching math for

214
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:52,903
electricians as part of my job.
They're like, Hey, can you do

215
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:55,753
some soldering for me? And like
put these. And you know, at this

216
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:59,023
point I would like kind of become
this like project. And I got to

217
00:11:59,023 --> 00:12:03,222
working, uh, after, you know, on
the code side, I learned that

218
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,503
there's this language called
processing, which was Java based

219
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,023
that could do the graphing pretty
easily for me. If I could just

220
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:12,283
pull the signal in and I got that
working. You know, like six

221
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:14,773
months later presented it at a
conference down in Saskatoon, one

222
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:18,722
of the cities in Saskatchewan.
And at that point, yeah. And, um,

223
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:22,293
you know, from there, I just, I
really wanted to continue making

224
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:25,113
things that would make me a
better teacher. And that drove me

225
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:28,113
for a long time. And then, you
know, a couple of years after

226
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:31,383
that, I started doing reflection
of what do I want in terms of a

227
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,712
career and a lifestyle and like,
what are the things I'm after?

228
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:38,192
And that really kind of led me to
getting interested in. Your code

229
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:42,543
as a career. Um, and, uh, there
weren't really, you know,

230
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:45,033
bootcamps and they were, I don't
even think I'd been really

231
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:48,092
created at that point or launched
or, you know, the whole suite of

232
00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:50,582
the FedEx, even me Coursera
awesome websites for these

233
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:54,363
things. Right. Um, so it was a
lot of learning. It was, I, you

234
00:12:54,363 --> 00:12:57,092
know, I did that all while I had
a full-time job and, you know,

235
00:12:57,092 --> 00:13:01,893
fast forward a number of years I
launched Typist, the company are

236
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:05,582
now run and then my little small
passion project, I sometimes call

237
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:10,442
it at the same time. Uh, I
exploded. Um, and this was maybe

238
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:15,302
six or six ish, six, seven years
ago. Now at AI, if nothing else

239
00:13:15,302 --> 00:13:18,543
is a combination of computer
science and like really strong

240
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:22,682
math background, um, and you
know, back then more emphasis on

241
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:25,113
the math, but today maybe more
emphasis on the computer science

242
00:13:25,113 --> 00:13:31,217
side and. Uh, IBM came knocking
and said, Hey, we are trying to

243
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,717
hire AI expertise. And, um, uh,
and at that point I had some

244
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:40,248
projects that like, I was
experimenting a lot in AI. And so

245
00:13:40,248 --> 00:13:42,738
they brought me into, they
offered me like dream job to go

246
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:47,087
in and be on this new open source
team that they're putting across

247
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:50,447
Canada. And I'd get to work with
all these huge companies and help

248
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:52,998
them do AI better and solve these
problems. And that sounded like a

249
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,962
blast. Uh, so I did that for a
number of years. And then later I

250
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:59,503
moved over to Microsoft to do a
similar type work, like more,

251
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:01,633
more hands. I wanted to get
deeper into projects. And

252
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,913
Microsoft gave me that
opportunity to go deeper into

253
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:07,962
science projects with, uh, you
know, um, companies and all for

254
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:11,143
free. Like these companies would
just parachute in would just,

255
00:14:11,232 --> 00:14:14,082
Microsoft would just parachute me
in and it's like, Yeah. we we're

256
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:16,332
going to help you do data science
better because if you do it on

257
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:19,217
our cloud, we're going to make a
lot of. So I'd get to go and just

258
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:21,768
like pick my projects and go
onsite. I get like a badge. It

259
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:24,798
was awesome. And, you know, and
build out these data science

260
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,378
projects and all the while on my
evenings and weekends building

261
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:30,798
our Typist, trying to get it to
the place where it could support,

262
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:33,707
you know, a basic income for me
and I could work on it full-time

263
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:38,057
which eventually happened. And,
um, and you know, that sort of

264
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:41,923
switch over process. Scary and,
you know, different than I had

265
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,793
imagined it would be. But
eventually my boss at Microsoft

266
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:48,972
was like, man, you gotta go do
this. It's there, like go do this

267
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:52,302
thing. And, and, uh, and I did.
And, uh, and that's what I've

268
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:54,253
been working on for the last
three or four years.

269
00:14:55,633 --> 00:15:01,937
Bekah: that's. That's I. I have
to ask about that switch. Cause I

270
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:08,717
feel like that sounds like very
scary. I'm giving up all of the

271
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:12,918
stuff that you've been doing with
a team, with all of these

272
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:19,847
resources and then jumping into
this entrepreneur journey. I know

273
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:23,687
that you said that you had some
encouragement, but like what

274
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:27,227
really pushed you to go all in on
Typist?

275
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:31,687
Matt: Ah, you know, it was, it,
it was really, really hard. Um,

276
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:38,253
you know, I. I guess like one of
the big factors was I thought

277
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:43,413
that, um, we, we had a project
lined up for Typist? and Typist.

278
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,753
Maybe this is the appropriate
time to kind of speak to what it

279
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:50,552
is. Um, we make software for
community college students who

280
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:54,003
are taking a certain set of
courses. So our first product was

281
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:57,977
for community college students
who are taking keyboard. Uh, and

282
00:15:58,008 --> 00:16:00,798
those are people studying
programs to be law clerks or

283
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:02,957
legal assistance, medical
assistance, or even executive

284
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:06,768
assistants, and very, you know,
there's interesting demographics

285
00:16:06,768 --> 00:16:09,197
in those programs, which is a
reason I'm really passionate to

286
00:16:09,197 --> 00:16:13,638
work on, uh, and honored to build
software for that group. Uh, and

287
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:16,727
then we have this second product,
which at that point back I was,

288
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:22,528
uh, was really, we had discussed.
And it was in this thing called

289
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:25,408
document production. So, you
know, people that go in these

290
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:28,107
fields need to be able to make a
professionally formatted business

291
00:16:28,107 --> 00:16:30,778
letter that has these exact
traits and the it's sort of a

292
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:34,827
vocational skill. And in that
particular field, it's rated as

293
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,307
like a top three employment skill
to, um, by all every industry

294
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:41,278
survey that's ever been done. Uh,
and it's really, really hard to

295
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,952
teach and. We had one of the
colleagues I've been kind of

296
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:48,873
kicking the tires with the people
who are using our keyboarding

297
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:51,113
soft. It'd be like, Hey, does
anyone want a build this with us?

298
00:16:51,373 --> 00:16:54,482
And by partner, just like give us
feedback, tell us, tell us what

299
00:16:54,482 --> 00:16:57,722
to build like whiteboard. And
ideally if we build something

300
00:16:57,722 --> 00:17:01,743
that you really liked. You know,
the person to use it and give us

301
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:04,952
the reference so that we can
maybe expand this. And I, and

302
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:07,022
that was a big part of the
decision was I had all that lined

303
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:11,883
up. And so for the six to seven
months prior to that, um, and

304
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:15,423
this was the final push I had
outsourced the development of it

305
00:17:15,423 --> 00:17:20,252
to a really great developer, um,
who like grades, you know,

306
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:24,992
really, really talented rails
developer. Um, and, uh, we had a

307
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:28,323
prototype. And we went back to
this college and presented this

308
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:30,153
and our take vacation days,
anytime I had to go take

309
00:17:30,153 --> 00:17:33,212
meetings. Right. So all of my
vacation for those four years was

310
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:36,272
consumed by Typist. And, uh, so
I'd take a vacation day. I'd go

311
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:38,942
and we'd present this back to the
group. And they had said, yes, if

312
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,012
you can build it and it can do
these things, but we need these

313
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:45,573
changes, you know, we'll use it.
Um, but at that point I looked

314
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:49,833
with like how we had constructed
the software and I said, it's not

315
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,403
going to get us to the finish
line. You know, specifically we'd

316
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:56,613
built it in rails and like, it
all works with file IO, so they

317
00:17:56,623 --> 00:18:00,093
need to upload this file and then
we would go compare it to this

318
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:03,032
other file. And they're both word
documents, which are incredibly

319
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:07,548
hard to work with. And we like,
you know, w all the existing

320
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:10,008
previous software, like, if
there's a typo in a paragraph,

321
00:18:10,248 --> 00:18:12,647
you lost all the marks of the
paragraph, because doing fuzzy

322
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:16,907
matching is like really, really
hard. Um, we just, I sat there

323
00:18:16,907 --> 00:18:19,248
and I'm like, we can't do this in
our web server. It takes like 20

324
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:22,577
seconds to process a single file.
be in classes. They'll do a test.

325
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:25,742
30 uploads at once. We'll never
be able to handle the spike in

326
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:28,313
traffic when there would be able
to, don't want a web service

327
00:18:28,313 --> 00:18:31,563
sitting idle for it. And I just
lost her short knew. We had to

328
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:34,442
rebuild the software completely
from scratch and we had five

329
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:37,432
months to do it. We had gone in
and already produced, like we had

330
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:40,022
already done the demo and be
like, Yeah. it's working look.

331
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:42,722
And I knew that we had to throw
away everything that we'd done

332
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,962
and build it from scratch, um,
which we did. Uh, so that was

333
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:50,282
like the, there was an immediacy
which helped. Make that decision

334
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:53,373
of like, I like, so when I went
in and had that conversation with

335
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:56,792
my wonderful, wonderful boss, uh,
I was gay and I was explaining

336
00:18:56,792 --> 00:19:01,742
this all to her. Um, she's like,
I'm like going, asking, like, if

337
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:05,133
we're going to launch this thing
and this could push Typist over

338
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:08,522
the mark of like, it could
support a couple employees, um,

339
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:13,008
I've got to go now. Like I can't
wait till next week. I've got to

340
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:17,357
start right now. Um, and she's
like, yep. Do it. And at that

341
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:20,538
point, I like almost on the spot
I gave my notice. I talked to my

342
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:25,788
wife and, and that was the jump
and it was a hard summer, by the

343
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:26,087
way.

344
00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:31,223
Dan: Yeah. I mean, that's pretty
intense. I mean, obviously I did.

345
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:37,114
Um, but it seems like it worked
out right. I mean kind of betting

346
00:19:37,114 --> 00:19:41,554
on yourself and I mean, maybe it
wasn't much of a bet of you. Did

347
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:46,054
you have a good idea of, said you
had to tear it down and rebuild

348
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:50,163
it. Did you have a good idea at
that moment of like what it was

349
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:52,713
going to look like when you
finished rebuilding it or were

350
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:55,173
you just like, we have like our
start from scratch and I have no

351
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:55,923
idea, you know,

352
00:19:56,084 --> 00:20:00,394
Matt: Yeah. we, we knew that I
did. And maybe, you know, I, and

353
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:01,963
I'm happy to speak to the, kind
of the details of it, because I

354
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:05,953
think they're interesting if
that's, you know, um, so like we,

355
00:20:06,044 --> 00:20:09,784
you know, I mentioned we couldn't
do this. Uh, because like, you

356
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:12,634
know, the really simple use case
was that if 20 students are doing

357
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:14,763
a test and they all upload their
documents at once and they take

358
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:18,423
25 seconds to process web servers
just can't do that. We would have

359
00:20:18,423 --> 00:20:21,243
to have like this incredible
scale that would just be so

360
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:26,709
expensive. We couldn't run the
business. And, um, so. The, my,

361
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:31,538
my theory was that we needed a
couple of things we needed to be

362
00:20:31,538 --> 00:20:35,048
using groupie because like a node
based system made a lot more

363
00:20:35,048 --> 00:20:38,078
sense than the way that a node
event loop works, you know? And,

364
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,308
uh, and the second thing was we
needed a way to deploy these sort

365
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,558
of algorithms that we were
building in a way that can handle

366
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,534
these spikes in traffic. And at
that point, uh, Sort of this

367
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:51,773
Lambda architecture, which is,
you know, all the clouds have a

368
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:55,044
product for this. So in Microsoft
is called Azure functions and AWS

369
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:59,993
is called, uh, Lambda in net.
Netlify just launched when I

370
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:02,034
think actually, and CloudFlare
has one called CloudFlare

371
00:21:02,034 --> 00:21:05,423
functions too, but they basically
work that like something happens

372
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:08,304
and they spin up your and they do
the thing you want it to do. And

373
00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:11,394
then they spend down and you can
throw a thousand at them. And

374
00:21:11,423 --> 00:21:13,673
they, you know, a thousand
instances will spit up. You'll

375
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:17,028
pay for the time they're up and
then they'll turn off. And so

376
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:20,959
that was kind of what was that we
had to rewrite this into that

377
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:23,898
this Lambda type architecture
that could handle these spikes.

378
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:27,078
We had to use, we had to switch
languages. So we had to use a

379
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,659
language that was compatible
there in while supported and Ruby

380
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:33,138
wasn't supported at all. So had
to go to JavaScript. And then

381
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:35,628
there was, you know, to your
question, Dan, there, there were

382
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,749
questions. I was really, really
concerned about, which were, how

383
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:43,648
are we going to go in and like
that problem on evaluation. So if

384
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:45,808
you're a student, you upload this
document and you're off by like

385
00:21:45,808 --> 00:21:49,229
two characters, we couldn't take
off all of the marks, right? So

386
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:52,648
we had to be able to go in and
compare the texts. We expected

387
00:21:52,648 --> 00:21:56,009
students to type in the text that
they did type and take off some

388
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:00,028
type of marks of as proportional
as do that and give meaningful

389
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,398
feedback on the other side. And
at that point I had no idea how

390
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:07,433
we're going to solve that
problem. Yeah. which we later

391
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:10,463
figured out a way to, and even
just converting, like how do we

392
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:13,913
even, you know, just as a quick
comment, doc, X-Files are really

393
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:15,834
hard to work with, but here's
like a fun thing you can do. If

394
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,314
you're on a windows machine, take
a doc X vitality, desktop, rename

395
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:25,314
it to.zip, and then extract. And
you'll see the general, how these

396
00:22:25,913 --> 00:22:28,554
files are structured inside.
There is all this kind of markup

397
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:30,324
that will be a little bit
familiar to you if you've seen

398
00:22:30,324 --> 00:22:34,163
XML or HTML before. Um, and you
can see all the stuff in there.

399
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:36,983
So we knew that we had to like
deal with that problem too, which

400
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:39,503
we didn't know how we were going
to handle, because we were using

401
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:41,933
these Ruby libraries that kind of
abstracted that away for us.

402
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:48,564
Bekah: Yeah. So you made this
career journey, I guess. So from

403
00:22:48,564 --> 00:22:54,443
math and then you were doing AI
data science stuff, and then

404
00:22:54,653 --> 00:23:00,324
rails backend stuff and, and now
JavaScript and react, right.

405
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,999
Matt: Yeah. And, you know, I
think the first part of that

406
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:07,838
would be like, it's worth
expanding on like, it was, um,

407
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:11,348
like when I started learning code
it, like, I, you know, data

408
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,854
science is generally on, in
Python. Like, those are the

409
00:23:13,854 --> 00:23:17,034
language for data science and
heavy emphasis on Python these

410
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:20,394
days, like academics. These are,
but nobody else really does. Um,

411
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:24,114
and so the, like, I really didn't
know a ton of Python, but it's

412
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:27,834
such an approachable language. I
really, that like that seven

413
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:32,699
years of learning code, like, you
know, I breezed past it in a

414
00:23:32,699 --> 00:23:35,699
sentence, but that was really
hard. It was a lot of evenings

415
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:39,419
and weekends. I was working full
time that whole time, uh, some

416
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,929
points had like even taking on
contract gigs, doing statistical

417
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:46,979
consulting for some stuff. And,
um, and web dev that I, was

418
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:50,098
learning during that time. Uh,
beca it was, uh, you know, I, had

419
00:23:50,098 --> 00:23:54,653
started, uh, The with, uh, like,
you know, I started with HTML and

420
00:23:54,653 --> 00:23:57,953
CSS and had like, learned that
and it built a personal website.

421
00:23:57,953 --> 00:24:00,473
And he was like, know, these
projects all the way through,

422
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:05,064
like I wanted, um, like at time
people were downloading TV shows

423
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:08,513
and movies and stuff, maybe, you
know, they shouldn't. I, but it

424
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,153
was like really hard. So like I
wanted to go, if I download the

425
00:24:11,513 --> 00:24:13,973
of the office, I wanted to search
the office and have it organized,

426
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:17,003
like episode one, episode two
episode three, rid of the ones

427
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:20,439
were like somebody holding their
camera and do. So does a website

428
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:25,088
to do that. And it was like so
basic, it was a single PHP file

429
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:29,259
that just went and like kind of
scraped the pirate bay and then

430
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:33,429
analyze the file names. Uh, and
then I had no idea how to use

431
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,669
databases, so it would just stick
the results into like a text

432
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:41,183
file. I'm like go daddy. So it
was like, that's where I was

433
00:24:41,183 --> 00:24:45,443
starting from. And it was, um, so
there's like, there's that there

434
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:48,114
were, um, uh, like, oh my God,
there's so many other, like

435
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:50,304
another one that was fine was
when I was teaching at the

436
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:54,973
college. Um, you'd put all your
marks into like, So I was like,

437
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:57,523
okay, well I want to give my
students more contextual feedback

438
00:24:57,523 --> 00:24:59,653
on how they're doing in the
course. So I put it into a Google

439
00:24:59,653 --> 00:25:01,604
doc and I was like, how do I get
this thing to send email? And

440
00:25:01,604 --> 00:25:03,163
then that was like, one of the
first things I had written in

441
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:06,614
JavaScript was to like, go take
all my students. And if they're

442
00:25:06,614 --> 00:25:10,003
like, if they've not done well on
the first two quizzes, send them

443
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:13,523
an email. That's like, Hey, you
know, John. I saw you didn't do

444
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:15,594
very well in the first few
quizzes. Here are my office

445
00:25:15,594 --> 00:25:18,294
hours. There's also the math help
center. If you need support, I'm

446
00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:21,473
here for you. Like, you know,
like really want to help you turn

447
00:25:21,473 --> 00:25:23,784
this around. And if they were
doing really well, they'd get

448
00:25:23,784 --> 00:25:26,513
like a more positive note with
different content. And I had like

449
00:25:26,513 --> 00:25:28,374
six different templates and
they're just hit go. And

450
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:30,743
everybody would get an email from
me and like my five sections or

451
00:25:30,743 --> 00:25:31,074
whatever.

452
00:25:33,084 --> 00:25:37,493
Bekah: I, I need that 10 years
ago. I wouldn't save me so much

453
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:40,044
time. Wow. That's amazing.

454
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,433
Matt: But like the fight I felt
guilty about back, I was I'd get

455
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:46,493
these responses and be like, wow,
thank you for taking the time to

456
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:53,034
write me this. Like

457
00:25:53,673 --> 00:25:56,284
Bekah: Wait, is that not a
product for teachers? Because if

458
00:25:56,284 --> 00:25:58,713
it's not totally should be.

459
00:25:58,933 --> 00:25:59,263
Dan: I was just

460
00:25:59,423 --> 00:25:59,874
Matt: yeah.

461
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:03,374
Dan: a CRM, right. A CRM, except
for students is like, you have

462
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:06,223
all the automated, automated mail
campaigns and stuff, you know,

463
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:09,044
except yours, except you're
emailing. That's amazing.

464
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:10,124
Bekah: I need to Google this

465
00:26:10,243 --> 00:26:10,973
Dan: It has to exist.

466
00:26:11,443 --> 00:26:14,324
Bekah: if, if it is a thing I
need to tell everybody that I

467
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:18,614
know that's still a teacher about
it. Um, and if not, then my new

468
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:19,124
project.

469
00:26:19,838 --> 00:26:22,659
Matt: Yeah. It's you know, so
that was like, there were these

470
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:25,449
projects on the way. Right. And
they were all usually connected

471
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:27,788
to something I wanted to see in
the world. Like, and another

472
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:30,788
really big one I took on that was
like less code, but it was, you

473
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:34,388
know, it was my first experience
with rails was, um, you know, we

474
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:38,243
had, I was teaching at the
college. Um, helping to volunteer

475
00:26:38,243 --> 00:26:40,374
a coach, this marketing team,
which I don't know what I was

476
00:26:40,374 --> 00:26:44,334
doing there. I was like the math
guy. Right. Um, and, uh, but I

477
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:46,644
wanted to get my students more
experience with the actual, like

478
00:26:46,644 --> 00:26:48,773
the part of marketing that really
is interesting to me is the

479
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,894
analytics of it. There's really
rich analytics and the math is

480
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:56,183
just super fun to look at, but
there is like a Google analytics

481
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:58,673
was out there at the time. It was
really hard to get experience

482
00:26:58,673 --> 00:27:00,564
with actual data. So I thought,
well, what if we could get like a

483
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:03,864
website up that would, um, you
know, have a bunch of data that

484
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:06,743
students could just mess around
with? And we could like do stuff.

485
00:27:06,743 --> 00:27:09,503
We could go put posters up and
drive traffic. And, and then

486
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:11,814
like, I was also really
interested in, still am in

487
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:14,124
volunteerism. And I said, you
know, I've had these great,

488
00:27:14,124 --> 00:27:16,794
wonderful, like life-changing
experience volunteering. Like,

489
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:21,804
you know, what, if we could drive
more volunteers to charities. Um,

490
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:25,074
and you know, I was also really
attracted to short video format.

491
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:30,084
So. I sorta took the summer off
and I emailed the sort of CEOs of

492
00:27:30,263 --> 00:27:34,074
charities in Toronto and said,
Hey, I went on Facebook and

493
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:36,144
Craigslist trying to find a
videographer who involved here

494
00:27:36,144 --> 00:27:39,233
with me. And I did. And we went,
my pitch was like, Hey, we're

495
00:27:39,233 --> 00:27:41,483
going to take your CEO. We're
going to go onsite where

496
00:27:41,483 --> 00:27:44,034
volunteerism is happening. We're
going to shoot like a 45 second

497
00:27:44,034 --> 00:27:46,973
to one minute video of you
telling volunteers why it would

498
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:50,453
be so great to volunteer with
your dog now. And we did that.

499
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:52,794
And we did like five of the
biggest charities in Toronto. And

500
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:56,124
we put them on a website that I
call them where the good is. And

501
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:58,074
then we took the marketing
stance. We promoted it around the

502
00:27:58,074 --> 00:28:00,923
college and then like we'd Google
in with assaults that they would

503
00:28:00,923 --> 00:28:03,203
like drive the traffic to the
website and we got to analyze it

504
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:06,384
all. And it was really fun. And
that was like my first website in

505
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,023
rails. So it was a static webpage
with just a bunch of videos, but

506
00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:13,253
it was a learn and, and, um, and
there's probably like a million

507
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:17,469
other projects that are similar.
those that's what I was living

508
00:28:17,618 --> 00:28:20,169
seven years was I was really
getting into web development. I

509
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:24,128
loved it. I loved making things
and the more relevant they were

510
00:28:24,128 --> 00:28:28,479
for me, the better. And, um, you
know, my last one, which was like

511
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:31,538
a full rails app, that was just a
static page. Right. Was this, I

512
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:35,199
wanted a Chrome extension. So my
wife, my, who was my girlfriend

513
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:37,598
at the time, we could just hit a
button in Chrome and we could

514
00:28:37,598 --> 00:28:39,308
share the webpage that we're
looking at with like a little

515
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:41,739
note. And it would just like
jumped to the other person's

516
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:44,653
browser. Yeah. Built a little app
that did that. And that was like

517
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:51,163
the first, know, full, like real
meaningful, like web app, you

518
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:55,753
know, like the did stuff backend
and used a database. And, and you

519
00:28:55,753 --> 00:28:58,663
know, during that time also, of
course it started coming out. So

520
00:28:58,663 --> 00:29:01,513
I took wonderful database course
from Stanford and then the

521
00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:04,993
university of Washington has
amazing courses. And, um, and

522
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,824
that allowed me to kind of get to
the bottom of how these things

523
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:09,969
worked, which I was incredibly
curious about. Um, Like the

524
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:11,828
hardware, software interface
course from the university of

525
00:29:11,828 --> 00:29:13,719
Washington is just straight up
one of the best courses I've ever

526
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:16,509
taken. Like it's like how it,
like, it tacos the problem of

527
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:19,749
like, how does the code you type
in Python change things in a

528
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:22,358
computer and how does the
computer work at all? And that

529
00:29:22,358 --> 00:29:25,568
was like the missing gap that I
needed to kind of address. And

530
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:29,189
that was a wonderful experience.
And, Uh, and yeah, that's what

531
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:31,778
like that seven years was like.
And, and then towards the end of

532
00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:34,598
it, the project that I made that
kind of got the attention of IBM,

533
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:39,308
Was I had like had this, am I
rambling here? I feel like I'm

534
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:39,759
talking about

535
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:40,509
Bekah: this is great.

536
00:29:41,078 --> 00:29:45,759
Matt: the, uh, I had a big
baseball fan. I've got my little

537
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,669
blue Jays hat in the background
on the you're here behind me.

538
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:52,808
And, um, and we love going to the
home opener, which is the first

539
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:58,118
game. And I had, uh, gone and we
buy tickets, but they're always

540
00:29:58,118 --> 00:30:00,338
selling out. So you have to buy
resale and resales, like three

541
00:30:00,338 --> 00:30:04,449
times the price. And we paid that
one year, we paid like $110,

542
00:30:04,568 --> 00:30:07,328
which was outrageous at the time
to sit in like $20 seats at like

543
00:30:07,328 --> 00:30:10,949
the top of the sitcom. And I was
so upset by this, you know, it

544
00:30:10,949 --> 00:30:14,409
was really, and then, you know,
one of my friends can come. So I

545
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:17,463
had to, like, I tried to scalp
the. So I was like outside the

546
00:30:17,463 --> 00:30:20,973
stadium instead of like, and
like, how do you know a couple of

547
00:30:21,273 --> 00:30:25,173
bottles of juice to give myself
the courage to do it? And I'm so

548
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:28,144
I was standing outside the
stadium with my best governor.

549
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:34,443
We're to see like tickets. And I
remember like, oh, there's 50,000

550
00:30:34,443 --> 00:30:36,304
people there. Of course, like a
friend walks by and he's like,

551
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:38,824
what in the hell are you doing?
And what in the heck are you

552
00:30:38,824 --> 00:30:41,973
doing? And then I'll never forget
this mom and her daughter, the

553
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:45,564
daughter must've been like 17, 18
years. And there they're walking

554
00:30:45,564 --> 00:30:48,983
by and I'm out there just tickets
and need a ticket. she's so

555
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:54,173
politely says, you, everyone no,
thank you. she looks at me and it

556
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:57,324
looks down at my shirt and I've
got my university Western shirt

557
00:30:57,324 --> 00:31:00,864
on and she doesn't like to her
face just drops. And she looks at

558
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:06,773
her daughter. Who's like also got
Western, for sure. It just has

559
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:10,913
this like sad look of horror as
they walk into this. Like, this

560
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:15,794
is what my daughter is going to
be. Uh, but anyways, that whole

561
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:19,213
experience has really upsetting.
And, um, so I'm like, well, you

562
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:22,903
know, I learned that if you
bought season tickets for like

563
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:29,534
all 90 games in a season, then
you would get like a 15% discount

564
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:33,163
and then I could get the $20
ticket. so of course, you know,

565
00:31:33,294 --> 00:31:36,223
what's a reasonable thing to do
is spend $9,000 on season

566
00:31:36,223 --> 00:31:39,913
tickets. Yeah. So I basically
took two thirds of my savings in

567
00:31:39,913 --> 00:31:42,864
my bank account. Yeah. Fronted
the money on season tickets. But

568
00:31:42,864 --> 00:31:47,213
my theory was could sell them at
face value to my friends. And

569
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:50,124
since I got this like 15%
discount, that would more than

570
00:31:50,124 --> 00:31:53,993
make up for the gap. And, uh, and
Pam and I could go to like three

571
00:31:53,993 --> 00:31:57,114
or four games for free, which is
all I really wanted. And, uh, but

572
00:31:57,114 --> 00:31:59,273
to do that, I needed to figure
out how to price all these

573
00:31:59,273 --> 00:32:04,148
tickets. And so I wrote. Electron
desktop app that went and scraped

574
00:32:04,148 --> 00:32:06,759
all the data from blue days.com
and scraped all the data from

575
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:10,868
StubHub. And I wrote an algorithm
to like, you know, if you scrape

576
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:12,848
StubHub one day and you scraped
the next day, you can figure out

577
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,648
what tickets are not there
anymore. And then you can figure

578
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:17,199
out what's sold and for what
price, since you knew all the

579
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:20,108
things. And so I built a really
nice clean data set, and then I

580
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:23,558
trained an algorithm to price my
tickets. And, uh, you know,

581
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:26,104
again, I have this electronic app
and I just click on. It would

582
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:29,614
price on my tickets, send an
email to my friends and, and then

583
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:34,294
people just earmarked what
tickets I want. And, uh, and it

584
00:32:34,294 --> 00:32:37,594
worked. And I did that for, you
know, I've been doing that four,

585
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:41,074
years now, or six years, I guess.
Uh, this is, there's like two

586
00:32:41,074 --> 00:32:43,564
year gap that I, you know, does
that not to do it because of

587
00:32:43,564 --> 00:32:47,824
COVID. Um, and, uh, and then that
got the attention of IB. I don't

588
00:32:47,824 --> 00:32:50,854
mean like, Hey, that's a really
awesome project. And that's what

589
00:32:50,854 --> 00:32:53,739
kind of opened that door. Um, But

590
00:32:55,423 --> 00:33:01,094
Bekah: that's when I, when I was
leaving education to come into

591
00:33:01,094 --> 00:33:06,673
tech, I made money. I remember
the most money I made. bought and

592
00:33:06,673 --> 00:33:11,693
resold Justin Bieber tickets on
stuff. And it was a lot of

593
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:15,683
research. Again, that would have
been something that would have

594
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:17,784
been very useful to me during
that time.

595
00:33:18,189 --> 00:33:18,699
Matt: oh yeah.

596
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:22,644
Bekah: amazing. Justin Bieber
also made me a lot of money, so I

597
00:33:22,644 --> 00:33:24,263
don't hate Justin Bieber. He's
great.

598
00:33:24,814 --> 00:33:27,334
Matt: He's Canadian. Yeah. He's
from down the road there

599
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:28,054
Bekah: That's right.

600
00:33:28,594 --> 00:33:30,364
Matt: and we have a lot of mixed
feelings, so it doesn't matter

601
00:33:30,364 --> 00:33:35,794
whether they're generally
positive. Good. Well, that's

602
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:35,973
good.

603
00:33:37,644 --> 00:33:42,878
Bekah: Yeah. Wow. I don't know
what to say other than that's

604
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:47,288
amazing. And what I did want to
say was, um, for, we have a lot

605
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:50,679
of people who are listening to
the podcast who are coming into

606
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,189
tech, and really love all these
stories that you're telling,

607
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:58,328
because all of the things that
you made were useful to you and

608
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:01,269
they made sense for you to make.
And so there's always that

609
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:03,578
question of like, well, what am
supposed to be doing? And what am

610
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:07,199
I supposed to be building? And
don't have to, um, Build an

611
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:10,498
electronic app that analyzes what
to price your blue days tickets,

612
00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:15,418
but find that thing that's
meaningful and then go for that

613
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:19,048
and see where that takes you and
who notices you based on that.

614
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:23,179
Matt: Totally. And, you know, I
have a friend I've, I've had

615
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:26,208
these experiences where, um, I,
you know, while I was at the

616
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:28,818
college back in Dan, I, you know,
I connected with this group

617
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:32,719
called hacker paradise that
facilitates these sort of work

618
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,318
experiences. And they w you know,
it out that was really impactful

619
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:40,878
for me. And there's a, a woman I
met there. Uh, who's amazing. I,

620
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,838
her name is Nicole Keller and she
has had this really, really cool

621
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:47,028
career path. But one of the
things she was doing down in New

622
00:34:47,028 --> 00:34:50,659
York was running coding classes
for kids. And the thing that I

623
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:54,498
I've got to visit Pam and I had
gone to New York and called up

624
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:56,389
Nicole and been like, Hey, and
she's like, oh yeah, I'm working

625
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:58,398
on doing this coding class
because I'm like, can we come see

626
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,639
that sounds awesome. And we and
it was like the attic of this

627
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:06,733
church. Like, you know, in, in
like mainland, and we, um, so I'm

628
00:35:06,793 --> 00:35:09,224
just going to say mainland New
York, York island, it wasn't,

629
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:13,094
what are you guys call it?
Manhattan. That's it? Yeah.

630
00:35:13,123 --> 00:35:18,164
Manhattan. And, uh, we, um, and
it was, but like the thing I

631
00:35:18,164 --> 00:35:21,074
loved back out was that they
started the kids who were like,

632
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:22,934
they were just building static
sites. He was like a website

633
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:25,603
builder. They were like as young
as like eight, nine years old,

634
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:30,153
but they started them with, uh,
they had gone to the UN. Uh, and

635
00:35:30,153 --> 00:35:32,074
I forget what it's called, but
like, basically these are like

636
00:35:32,074 --> 00:35:35,134
our principles and they had asked
the kids, like, what's one thing

637
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:37,324
that you'd want to affect change
with, and let's build a website

638
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:40,864
to do that. Like they, they
started, they didn't start with

639
00:35:40,923 --> 00:35:44,014
teaching JavaScript or teaching
HTML and CSS. They started with

640
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:46,713
like, what's the change you want
to see in the world? And how can

641
00:35:46,713 --> 00:35:50,733
we use these amazing tools to do
this? And I think that for people

642
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:54,853
who are. Getting into tech, uh,
you know, it's there and a lot of

643
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:57,704
people that are coming in for
many reasons and attack. And

644
00:35:57,704 --> 00:36:00,463
especially now it's like, I think
people are realizing that you can

645
00:36:00,463 --> 00:36:02,353
have this great lifestyle with
it, which is wonderful. And

646
00:36:02,353 --> 00:36:04,903
that's a great reason to come
into tech there's these other

647
00:36:04,903 --> 00:36:07,844
things that are connected to it.
I think one thing I'd love to

648
00:36:07,844 --> 00:36:13,393
introduce to that sort of thought
processes, that is a tremendously

649
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:17,978
powerful thing. Make computers do
stuff automatically and that's

650
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:21,938
awesome. And it can really affect
positive change on the road. And

651
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:24,909
so, you know, as you're figuring
out what your learning projects

652
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,358
think about what, like what you
to change about the world. Like,

653
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:31,719
you know, can you make something
for your F your friend group? Can

654
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,608
you make something for yourself?
Can you automate something that

655
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,639
you're doing Can you make
something that would be just

656
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,329
really funny or cool, you know,
like what do you want to make?

657
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:43,748
And, um, and I think if you start
with that, like that can be

658
00:36:43,748 --> 00:36:48,204
really powerful because, you
know, if you're selling. one of

659
00:36:48,204 --> 00:36:49,853
the biggest challenges you're
going to face. And one of the

660
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:54,054
biggest challenges I faced is how
do you do it regularly? There

661
00:36:54,054 --> 00:36:58,344
would be weeks. I couldn't myself
to have the energy to code at

662
00:36:58,344 --> 00:37:00,773
like nine o'clock at night.
Right. and to continue that

663
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:03,983
learning learning is so hard and
it's such an emotionally

664
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:08,003
challenging journey too. Um, but
if you're connected to something

665
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:11,094
that you just want to see out
there, that that's a deeper level

666
00:37:11,094 --> 00:37:14,724
of motivation than, you know, of
the other ones that can be out

667
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:17,304
there. I think that's powerful.

668
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:23,818
Dan: Yeah, I love that a lot, you
know, and this is we actually, we

669
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:26,789
just released Roger's episode.
Uh, we talked to him a couple of

670
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:31,358
weeks ago and. And he said a lot
of the same things that he has

671
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:34,898
sort of a, I mean, not the exact
path, but like self-taught, um,

672
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:37,869
and, and solving his own
problems, sort of thing to learn,

673
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:41,559
uh, coding. And so I was, uh, on
the same boat too. I think my

674
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:46,719
first website, well, that wasn't
like a geo city site was like my

675
00:37:46,949 --> 00:37:49,119
site for my band. Right. And it
was like in flash or whatever.

676
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:56,918
Um, just, uh, yeah, I mean, it's
fine, but, uh, the, um, We

677
00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:00,429
nowadays there's so many learning
opportunities or the boot camps

678
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:02,768
and everything like that. And
there's so much, so many

679
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:06,009
different choices to make so many
different paths you can take. And

680
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:10,179
I, it, when came up it's, there
was nothing, you know, nothing

681
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:13,298
like that at all. Uh, was some
books that were out of date as

682
00:38:13,298 --> 00:38:15,909
soon as they hit the shelves and,
you know, and then the internet,

683
00:38:15,938 --> 00:38:20,409
right. And and things like that.
But, um, I found success the

684
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:25,043
same, the same way it was, uh,
doing things that. We're either

685
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:29,003
fun or like, I want it to fix.
Right. you're telling a story,

686
00:38:29,063 --> 00:38:32,123
uh, w when you were talking about
the, um, automated spreadsheet,

687
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:36,114
the thing that, you know, was
thinking in my head, this it's

688
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:40,284
like a curse and a blessing of
people who learn program. Like,

689
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,443
once you start down the path,
like once you've figured out some

690
00:38:42,443 --> 00:38:46,373
stuff that you start seeing this
everywhere, like, oh my God, that

691
00:38:46,403 --> 00:38:52,074
I could make this easier. Right.
it's like, it's. When you do it,

692
00:38:52,074 --> 00:38:55,733
it's like a blessing, right. But
it's obviously I have this for me

693
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:59,213
anyway. this isn't for everybody,
but it's like, thinking about it

694
00:38:59,244 --> 00:39:02,603
all the time for everything.
sometimes it gets out of hand.

695
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:06,204
Sometimes I'm automating things
that don't actually take me that

696
00:39:06,204 --> 00:39:09,034
long. Probably it probably the
work is taking longer than it

697
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:14,784
did, but, uh, you know, it's,
it's, uh, I don't know. It's such

698
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:16,974
a, once you get into that habit
of thinking that way and like,

699
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:22,284
uh, making things it's, it can
be, said, it can prove you can

700
00:39:22,284 --> 00:39:27,594
improve little things or, uh,
little things, you know, like

701
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:30,414
small things with your family or
your friends, or, you know, large

702
00:39:30,443 --> 00:39:33,054
changes to it. It's it's, it's
cool. There's so many apps, so

703
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:33,864
many possibilities out there.

704
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:36,659
Matt: I mean, are there, uh, are
there any other projects that

705
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:43,708
you've done are particularly
redundant or maybe like not the

706
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:47,009
effective use of time or

707
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:49,228
Dan: well, I see how many color
lights can see by me.

708
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,478
Matt: quite a few actually.

709
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:56,068
Dan: Yeah. Every time we start,
like there was a two months or

710
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:59,128
something where, so these are all
like Hue light bulbs and there's,

711
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:03,369
there's ones you can't see too.
And I've spent so much time. I

712
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:06,039
hated the lights in here I had
before these, I just had like

713
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:10,148
lights, like lamps everywhere
never could get the lighting.

714
00:40:10,148 --> 00:40:13,449
Right. And then I got these,
know, so I have now I got these

715
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:15,849
huge, I'm like, this is the
perfect solution hue bulbs. Cause

716
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:17,739
he can connect, you know, you can
connect to them with your phone

717
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:21,849
or your, you know, uh, there's
probably a web. Um, Mac app and

718
00:40:21,909 --> 00:40:25,509
all that stuff. Uh, and so I
replaced all balls with these

719
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:28,539
things. And now, now there's too
many off, like now it's like,

720
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:31,298
there's too much to do. I can, I
have too many options, too many

721
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:34,869
colors, too many like ways I can
turn them up and down. And also,

722
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:38,994
I, I kind of exactly how I wanted
it, but then it was. Okay. Well,

723
00:40:38,994 --> 00:40:42,684
it's still a pain for me to like
hope in my phone and like the

724
00:40:42,684 --> 00:40:46,673
button, you know, like try to get
these like timing automations. I

725
00:40:46,673 --> 00:40:50,184
finally bought, oh, you can't see
it. But I bought, uh, so who has

726
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:53,963
this, like a button that it is
just like a little, like a little

727
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:56,393
click button and you can put it
on the wall or you can put it

728
00:40:56,393 --> 00:40:59,273
wherever and you can set that to
do whatever you want when you

729
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:04,014
click it different ways. So I
have that on my wall now. uh, I,

730
00:41:04,014 --> 00:41:08,664
uh, yeah, I, I spent like five
days of. Being happy. I'm like,

731
00:41:08,664 --> 00:41:11,333
huh? This is, this is it. I have
it. And like, just this morning I

732
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:15,344
sat down. I'm like, I should
change the colors of these, like

733
00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:22,103
now, like, so as a, sometimes
struggle with being satisfied

734
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:26,034
with things. But, uh, I still, it
is. It's also fun though, you

735
00:41:26,034 --> 00:41:26,213
know?

736
00:41:28,364 --> 00:41:32,954
Matt: The, uh, in fact, uh, you
like you have a Coffee, I think

737
00:41:32,954 --> 00:41:35,864
it would be totally fair to call
that like an, a, like an amazing

738
00:41:35,864 --> 00:41:37,844
project that both of you have
created. It's the community I

739
00:41:37,844 --> 00:41:42,253
love and love being part of. And
so, like, does that, is it sort

740
00:41:42,253 --> 00:41:44,753
of the same sort of thing that
has happened with you, Bekah,

741
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:47,143
where you've had these things
that you've taken on made and

742
00:41:47,954 --> 00:41:50,324
resulted in these learning
experiences? And I'd imagine

743
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:52,423
Virtual Coffee has been an
amazing learning experience

744
00:41:52,628 --> 00:41:56,259
Bekah: Oh, for sure. It's been a
learning experience and it's been

745
00:41:56,259 --> 00:42:00,489
great. I feel like I'm always
dropping things. We have, um, the

746
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:05,619
maintainers channel. And so you,
there, there will be times where

747
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:09,009
I just like drop a bunch of
different ideas. Like these are

748
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:12,188
all things that I think we should
be doing. And a lot of times,

749
00:42:12,188 --> 00:42:17,259
like I'm writing out all of the
processes or. Means or what

750
00:42:17,259 --> 00:42:20,829
support we need. And then
obviously we don't do all of

751
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:25,389
those because there's only 24
hours in the day. It's just not

752
00:42:25,389 --> 00:42:28,838
possible. But, and that was like,
I got four hours of sleep last

753
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:32,858
night it was because last night
before bed. That was having this

754
00:42:32,858 --> 00:42:37,628
idea about a tech summit that I
wanted to be doing. And like

755
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:41,918
messaging Kirk and Nick Taylor
about that, like, Hey, is this a,

756
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:45,579
is this a idea that's too out
there? Or is this something that

757
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:51,344
maybe is useful or good or worth
talking about? And then. I fell

758
00:42:51,344 --> 00:42:54,673
asleep and then it was like three
in the morning I woke up and my

759
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:56,983
brain was like, all right. Yeah.
Let's, let's figure this out

760
00:42:56,983 --> 00:43:04,153
right now. No. Um, but I feel
like, you know, it's a lot of

761
00:43:04,153 --> 00:43:08,143
that, but learning has been
really great. And now I feel like

762
00:43:08,143 --> 00:43:11,804
I'm going down this, I don't like
notion I have not liked it

763
00:43:11,804 --> 00:43:16,679
anytime I've used it, but like my
methods. Storing all of these

764
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:21,628
ideas and writing about them is
just satisfactory now. And so

765
00:43:21,628 --> 00:43:25,349
I've started going down the
notion rabbit hole of like, this

766
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:28,349
is, this is what I need to do.
And I need to automate these

767
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:33,449
things to my notion, because I
know that I can. So feel like you

768
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:38,278
could probably automate like your
lights look like through notion,

769
00:43:38,518 --> 00:43:41,818
right? If you just select what
mood you're in and then it will

770
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:44,994
automatically set your. So Dan,
you should try that.

771
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:47,829
Dan: last time I messed with
notion. I had like a nervous

772
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:50,588
breakdown trying to get
everything exactly like.

773
00:43:51,224 --> 00:43:52,603
Bekah: is making me a template.
So.

774
00:43:53,753 --> 00:43:57,414
Dan: that's, that's the issue I
have with notion is, is, uh, it's

775
00:43:57,414 --> 00:43:59,664
a great product and it's a very,
very cool initiative. There's

776
00:43:59,664 --> 00:44:02,423
just too many possibilities and
it's too pop it's like possible

777
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:07,253
to get it. It seems possible to
get it perfect. And it's like,

778
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:11,034
when that like perfect thing gets
in my head, it's hard to

779
00:44:11,094 --> 00:44:12,233
sometimes hard to let it go. So.

780
00:44:13,409 --> 00:44:16,289
Matt: Yeah. We we've spent a lot
of time in notion to we, you

781
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:19,228
know, it's things that are highly
customizable are often not the

782
00:44:19,228 --> 00:44:20,369
best tools, right? Like it's,

783
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:20,798
Dan: Yeah.

784
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:23,248
Matt: know, I appreciate the
software that has opinion

785
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:23,668
sometimes.

786
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:29,588
Bekah: My, uh, right now I've
just collected way too many

787
00:44:29,588 --> 00:44:33,969
different ways of doing things.
Like, you know, I've got all

788
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:38,798
these apps to help me with
planning or note taking or, you

789
00:44:38,798 --> 00:44:42,458
know, what, there's just way too
many of them. So I feel like I'm

790
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:49,239
just very I'm or nothing kind of
person. And so I can't. All of

791
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:56,068
these need one thing and notion
is the rule them all up.

792
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:56,619
Apparently.

793
00:44:58,353 --> 00:45:01,204
Matt: And so then, you know,
circling back, like Bekah, you

794
00:45:01,204 --> 00:45:05,523
have this awesome job. You're an
community manager. Did you have

795
00:45:05,523 --> 00:45:08,403
those started the Virtual Coffee,
or was that something that you

796
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,364
learned and kind of just figured
out going through the.

797
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:17,034
Bekah: when I, when I was in
undergrad, I graduated in three

798
00:45:17,034 --> 00:45:19,764
years. So I took a bunch of
credits, but I was also in 10

799
00:45:19,764 --> 00:45:24,893
clubs and I was an officer in
like five of them. So I feel like

800
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:29,664
been a lifelong journey of
community building and many

801
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:35,043
points where I've tried to reject
that. Like, please me know. Be in

802
00:45:35,043 --> 00:45:38,853
a hole by myself and not talk to
people. Uh, but I keep coming

803
00:45:38,853 --> 00:45:41,614
back to it. I feel like finally
hit the point where I'm like,

804
00:45:42,454 --> 00:45:47,853
like this, this is a skillset I
should utilize it and figure out

805
00:45:47,853 --> 00:45:55,353
how I can best do that thing. So
yeah. It's it's I guess part of

806
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:55,744
me.

807
00:45:57,074 --> 00:46:00,233
Matt: That's really cool. I, you
know, I think. Like one of the

808
00:46:00,233 --> 00:46:05,143
things that, uh, you know, I was
hard to figure out and I'm, I'm

809
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:07,373
hoping, I think it's okay. I'm
kind of like left turning the

810
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:09,233
conversation a little bit. One of
the things that was really hard

811
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,423
to figure out in, in running a
business, it was like, how do you

812
00:46:11,423 --> 00:46:14,873
hire? And you need to figure it
all out from scratch. Because

813
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:17,603
like, we had hired a bunch of
people that make stuff IBM, but

814
00:46:17,603 --> 00:46:19,554
it was all a very catered
experience. Like we had, we

815
00:46:19,554 --> 00:46:24,503
outsourced all of the hard. And
we got these like just like 50

816
00:46:24,503 --> 00:46:27,023
incredible candidates and we
would divide them up on our team

817
00:46:27,023 --> 00:46:28,974
and figure out who's going to do
round one, round two round three.

818
00:46:29,063 --> 00:46:32,873
Right. Um, and that like
interviewing is easy, but hiring

819
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,273
is hard and hiring is all that
other stuff. It's like finding

820
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:37,793
people and evaluating them. And,
and then, you know, you read

821
00:46:37,793 --> 00:46:39,864
about all the bad things that
happen to hiring process, and you

822
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:41,514
don't want to do those and you
want to do the good things and

823
00:46:41,514 --> 00:46:45,054
you want to get the right person
and the right people. Um, thing

824
00:46:45,054 --> 00:46:48,313
that has always stand out to me
is personal. And it's, it's

825
00:46:48,414 --> 00:46:50,813
probably not surprising given the
history I just described. Right.

826
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:53,873
Like I, like, I value them a lot,
but I think that when somebody

827
00:46:53,873 --> 00:46:57,384
comes in and they say, Hey, I
made this thing why I made it.

828
00:46:57,384 --> 00:47:00,954
And here's like how it's
important for small businesses,

829
00:47:00,954 --> 00:47:06,429
especially. So helpful because
it's like, the person thinking

830
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:10,148
about a need on the other side of
what they're doing. And like, you

831
00:47:10,148 --> 00:47:13,989
know, it's, don't have tickets
where we're working through.

832
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:17,079
We're too small. We, you know, we
don't have a ton of process

833
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:20,708
around things, but when people
come in and I imagine this is the

834
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:24,489
case for you, Bekah, you do this
amazing community management and

835
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:28,239
all this other stuff. And Virtual
Coffee as this incredible example

836
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:33,773
of you doing that in tech at
scale. And. That's awesome.

837
00:47:34,324 --> 00:47:36,753
Bekah: Yeah. I mean, and that's
what led to the job that I have

838
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:41,193
right now. I wasn't looking for
work. Um, my team lead reached

839
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:45,094
out to me and it was based on
Virtual Coffee and somebody else

840
00:47:45,094 --> 00:47:48,543
had, uh, who I'd interviewed
with, who had reached out to

841
00:47:48,903 --> 00:47:53,333
summer. Um, Because they knew
about Virtual Coffee. You

842
00:47:53,364 --> 00:47:58,014
recommended me like I was on the
top of their list. And so once he

843
00:47:58,014 --> 00:48:01,494
started looking into Virtual
Coffee, um, I think he watched

844
00:48:01,523 --> 00:48:04,643
some of our lunch and learn
videos and read blog posts. Like

845
00:48:04,643 --> 00:48:10,134
there, there is, uh, um, my
community building resume is out

846
00:48:10,134 --> 00:48:15,474
there because of all of the
things that we do. And so. Yeah,

847
00:48:15,543 --> 00:48:18,773
it is, like a project. I hadn't
really thought about it that way,

848
00:48:18,773 --> 00:48:23,184
but is this, this living resume
of all of the things that I've

849
00:48:23,184 --> 00:48:23,934
been working on.

850
00:48:24,923 --> 00:48:27,983
Matt: Totally. Dan watch out
because Phillips is going to come

851
00:48:27,983 --> 00:48:31,403
knocking. I say, Hey, I heard at
least with our light bulbs,

852
00:48:33,134 --> 00:48:34,123
Dan: Yeah,

853
00:48:34,793 --> 00:48:35,423
Matt: of Shu.

854
00:48:35,594 --> 00:48:38,994
Dan: they're going to come and
say. I have this product, this

855
00:48:38,994 --> 00:48:41,094
product will finally solve all
your problems.

856
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:44,679
Matt: Yeah, I hope all the, our
conversation with this podcast

857
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,378
has an index because we'll go to
these Google searches. I mean,

858
00:48:47,378 --> 00:48:49,539
that's just going to be all
Philips hue, light bulbs.

859
00:48:50,543 --> 00:48:52,574
Bekah: But we are open for
sponsorships.

860
00:48:54,423 --> 00:48:54,844
Dan: That's right.

861
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,628
Matt: Oh my gosh. Yeah. it's a,
that's really interesting. I

862
00:48:58,628 --> 00:49:03,789
think those personal projects,
they, they really. And, um, you

863
00:49:03,789 --> 00:49:06,219
know, and certainly there's
merit, if you're going to a

864
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:08,978
bootcamp and going through that,
like you want to stay on task.

865
00:49:08,978 --> 00:49:11,648
Right. And if you're going to get
great learning, great feedback by

866
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,628
building something that like the
boot camp is saying, oh, we're

867
00:49:13,628 --> 00:49:17,259
going to build like a cart.
That's totally cool. Right. But

868
00:49:17,259 --> 00:49:19,509
those, those other pieces of
like, Hey, I've got this skill

869
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:23,994
sat down. I can use it to really
do anything. It is just so

870
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:28,313
attractive to me in a hiring
process. it really separates

871
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:31,373
people out. Um, and I'd imagine
that's been the experience for

872
00:49:31,373 --> 00:49:33,143
both of you, from what you've
described to.

873
00:49:33,893 --> 00:49:37,164
Dan: And, and like, if you are,
your only projects coming out of

874
00:49:37,164 --> 00:49:41,213
a bootcamp or what you did in
the. And everybody else is trying

875
00:49:41,213 --> 00:49:43,344
to get a job too. You know,
everybody is going to have the

876
00:49:43,344 --> 00:49:46,043
same set of projects. Right. And
so that's, that's another thing

877
00:49:46,074 --> 00:49:49,284
that's doing those. maybe it's,
maybe there's not enough time to

878
00:49:49,284 --> 00:49:51,474
do it while you're in the
bootcamp, you know, maybe kind of

879
00:49:51,563 --> 00:49:55,853
do it after, but the, those
personal projects, I totally

880
00:49:55,853 --> 00:50:01,434
agree with you, man. It's it, it
says, it says so much about you

881
00:50:01,434 --> 00:50:03,954
without even speaking. And then
it also gives you something to

882
00:50:03,954 --> 00:50:04,164
talk

883
00:50:04,463 --> 00:50:05,003
Matt: No.

884
00:50:05,153 --> 00:50:06,983
Dan: to talk about because you
did it and you know, and you

885
00:50:06,983 --> 00:50:12,114
know, so it's not a theoretical.
Thing or a school assignment that

886
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:15,233
you weren't connected with, you
know? Um, and again, it doesn't

887
00:50:15,233 --> 00:50:20,483
have to be world changing or a
successful product or like that.

888
00:50:20,483 --> 00:50:23,094
Right? You, you were talking
about that Chrome extension that

889
00:50:23,094 --> 00:50:25,523
you made, that's literally just
you and your wife. Right.

890
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:26,454
Matt: Yeah.

891
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:29,273
Dan: and that's it like, that's,
that's a cool project. And I

892
00:50:29,273 --> 00:50:31,523
would like, like I enjoyed
hearing about it and I would, if

893
00:50:31,523 --> 00:50:34,344
I was hiring, I would also enjoy
hearing about it. It doesn't, you

894
00:50:34,344 --> 00:50:37,253
know, you didn't like sell it to
somebody or, it doesn't have to

895
00:50:37,253 --> 00:50:37,643
be so.

896
00:50:38,693 --> 00:50:38,844
Bekah: Yeah.

897
00:50:38,914 --> 00:50:42,264
Dan: a huge thing. It's, it's
just, uh, the thing that you

898
00:50:42,264 --> 00:50:44,903
decided to do on your own, and
you figured out how to do it and

899
00:50:44,903 --> 00:50:45,713
that's, that's the cool part.

900
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:51,309
Bekah: We just wrapped up a
hackathon at deep gram. And one

901
00:50:51,338 --> 00:50:55,539
of our participants I think, five
submissions and this is a month

902
00:50:55,539 --> 00:51:00,938
long hackathon and submission
were all interesting and they

903
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:04,659
were all beautiful. The design
was really great. I'm really

904
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:08,289
terrible at design. And the fact
that all of these looked really

905
00:51:08,289 --> 00:51:12,159
wonderful. Were meaningful and
interesting projects was great.

906
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:16,268
Um, but I interviewed that
participant for a blog post

907
00:51:16,268 --> 00:51:22,239
highlight being able to hear the
stories behind it, hear how he

908
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:28,369
communicated, what he did, his
approach, how he did it. He's a

909
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:31,969
person and the top of my book
that I would recommend for a job,

910
00:51:31,998 --> 00:51:35,478
but I know that he's looking and
he's going to be more actively

911
00:51:35,478 --> 00:51:40,969
looking soon. so when anything
comes up, I know that I'm going

912
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:44,688
to reach out to that person. So,
know, if it doesn't catch the eye

913
00:51:44,748 --> 00:51:46,009
of somebody who's doing the

914
00:51:46,443 --> 00:51:46,713
Matt: Um,

915
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:49,938
Bekah: might catch the eye of
somebody position where people

916
00:51:49,938 --> 00:51:53,449
reach out to them and say, Hey,
do you know anybody? Like, yes, I

917
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:55,938
do. This person would be really,
really great for this.

918
00:51:57,963 --> 00:52:00,693
Matt: Yeah, that's, uh, that's
really interesting, you know, and

919
00:52:00,693 --> 00:52:03,603
another sort of related thing
that I hear a lot of hiring

920
00:52:03,603 --> 00:52:06,333
managers articulate, and there's
famous examples of this too, is,

921
00:52:06,753 --> 00:52:10,628
is like a really strong indicator
of success in a business. Or in a

922
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:14,199
particular role is how has that
person achieved a success or

923
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:18,759
excellence in a completely
different area. Right. And, um,

924
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,849
you know, the Shopify had this
famous example where their CEO

925
00:52:21,849 --> 00:52:24,429
gave an internship or a job to
someone because they are like

926
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:30,219
ranked in the at start. You know,
and there's like similar sort of

927
00:52:30,278 --> 00:52:35,349
conversation and sales, you know,
this other sort of area around

928
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:38,378
people who have had athletic
success, you know? So there,

929
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:40,748
there are people who are sales
managers, they were like, oh, you

930
00:52:40,748 --> 00:52:44,289
were a division two athlete and
track. Like that's a really

931
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:48,248
strong indicator for this other
type of thing. And I think like

932
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:51,159
you also see it in like
volunteers, I'm like the stuff

933
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:53,559
you did and we're describing it
in university of Bekah. Right.

934
00:52:54,324 --> 00:52:57,083
Um, it's interesting. These
signals, because the way that we

935
00:52:57,264 --> 00:53:01,434
typically interview is like in
front of a whiteboard and we

936
00:53:01,434 --> 00:53:06,563
just, we know it's, it's a, it's
hard process to take on anyways,

937
00:53:07,344 --> 00:53:07,733
all that.

938
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,728
Bekah: Yeah, it is really hard.
And I think even hearing a lot of

939
00:53:12,728 --> 00:53:16,898
conversations around hiring where
people are trying to do things

940
00:53:16,929 --> 00:53:20,648
there, there's still so much of
the process where we're stuck

941
00:53:20,648 --> 00:53:29,548
inside this box. So than like
really trying to. Rethink how we

942
00:53:29,548 --> 00:53:32,518
do the entire process. We're
like, well, we're going to

943
00:53:32,518 --> 00:53:36,748
rethink, but still have to do all
of these things. And we have to

944
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:41,548
ask these questions because have
to, you, you don't have to,

945
00:53:41,548 --> 00:53:45,719
that's not, is that indicating?
And how does that tell you

946
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:48,898
whether or not that's going to be
a good person for you to work

947
00:53:48,898 --> 00:53:53,429
with or a good team for you to
join? How do we the way that

948
00:53:53,429 --> 00:54:01,003
we're. Doing hiring, how we're
onboarding new people, how we are

949
00:54:01,003 --> 00:54:05,474
looking at junior developers in
this hiring process. I can't, in

950
00:54:05,474 --> 00:54:09,014
my mind, it has to be, there's a
much bigger shift that needs to

951
00:54:09,014 --> 00:54:12,643
happen. Then, you know, these
tiny changes that we keep seeing

952
00:54:12,643 --> 00:54:13,244
happening.

953
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:18,369
Matt: Yeah, I, you know, I,
there's a part of me that. Um,

954
00:54:18,608 --> 00:54:21,518
and I, I want to sort of say this
and that like the best possible

955
00:54:21,518 --> 00:54:26,798
way that I wish that people
generally were more deliberate

956
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:30,668
about what they job. And this has
been something that's been

957
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:33,998
incredibly important for me. And,
you know, there's those books

958
00:54:33,998 --> 00:54:36,458
that like, sort of get you
thinking on these topics, but.

959
00:54:37,224 --> 00:54:41,063
Like really early on for me was
that at that juncture where I'm

960
00:54:41,063 --> 00:54:44,364
like, oh, like a career in tech
specifically, there's a shift I

961
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,483
had, you know, a couple of years
after learning code where I've

962
00:54:47,543 --> 00:54:50,634
very deliberately, I want to run
a business. I want to run a

963
00:54:50,634 --> 00:54:53,123
technology based business. And
that wasn't for the sake of

964
00:54:53,184 --> 00:54:55,523
wanting to do that. It was
because of these other things

965
00:54:55,523 --> 00:54:58,043
that I wanted. I literally had a
moment where I sat down and I

966
00:54:58,043 --> 00:55:02,554
said, what do I want it in my
work life? And, you know, for me,

967
00:55:02,554 --> 00:55:04,744
they were things that were
connected to autonomy. I wanted

968
00:55:04,983 --> 00:55:08,134
like in a perfect world, I would
work where, and when I wanted to,

969
00:55:08,134 --> 00:55:11,284
I would like, I was always
confused that we had this like 40

970
00:55:11,284 --> 00:55:14,784
hour a week. That we often live
in, like, why does that, why does

971
00:55:14,784 --> 00:55:17,844
that have to exist? You know,
like what are the reasons that

972
00:55:17,844 --> 00:55:22,074
the edges of that box are there?
Um, and like what if one week I

973
00:55:22,074 --> 00:55:25,403
want to work less? And when we, I
wanted that type of control to,

974
00:55:25,884 --> 00:55:29,483
um, you know, there were these, I
wanted to work on any type of

975
00:55:29,483 --> 00:55:32,693
problem that I wanted. I wanted
to have the potential for

976
00:55:32,693 --> 00:55:36,293
financial independence, um, you
know, these types of things. And

977
00:55:36,344 --> 00:55:40,403
that put like, you know, to me,
that was. Really helpful because

978
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:43,344
it determined the types of jobs
that I wanted to work at and why.

979
00:55:43,824 --> 00:55:46,643
And so when I started applying
to, I, like, I think I applied

980
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:50,784
to, know, IBM and Microsoft aside
because I never actually put an

981
00:55:50,784 --> 00:55:56,724
application into, um, either
company, once you get in it, I

982
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:59,813
just want to go there, but it's a
different process. And, um, but

983
00:55:59,813 --> 00:56:02,153
identified a to technology
companies to be a programmer and

984
00:56:02,244 --> 00:56:04,994
that my purpose and applying to
them was, you know, the, the

985
00:56:05,003 --> 00:56:07,434
conventional wisdom that working
at a startup will help you do a

986
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:10,434
startup. And that's what I
wanted. I wanted to run my own

987
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:12,713
business. So I was applying to a
very particular type of company

988
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:16,344
because the purpose of that
learning was to help me do this

989
00:56:16,344 --> 00:56:20,273
thing later. And you know, the
funny thing about people who are

990
00:56:20,304 --> 00:56:23,873
junior developer developers and
who are graduating like in 2022,

991
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:26,153
isn't a very short period of
time, but they're the hiring.

992
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:32,688
And, you know, I I, my gut
feeling is that if were

993
00:56:32,688 --> 00:56:36,679
approaching that process with
like a very deliberate set of

994
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:40,489
values and intentions, that
hiring would change on the

995
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:44,748
backend later, um, or maybe not.

996
00:56:48,969 --> 00:56:50,708
Bekah: Yeah, that's interesting.
I hadn't really thought about

997
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:55,958
that and it can be really hard,
especially with many people

998
00:56:55,989 --> 00:57:00,548
looking for jobs on the market
right now. And that I spent a lot

999
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:05,079
of time telling people. When you
join your first team, it should

1000
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:09,849
be about the people and not the
project, because seen so many

1001
00:57:09,849 --> 00:57:14,139
people jump into particularly ed
tech companies. I don't know.

1002
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:19,778
It's just generally ed tech,
that's toxic or what, but just

1003
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:25,028
bad experiences. And there's been
the whole like trade-off thing.

1004
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:30,923
Well, you know, we've got a great
mission. Well, but. Doing a

1005
00:57:30,923 --> 00:57:35,003
terrible job of managing a team,
being kind to other people, you

1006
00:57:35,003 --> 00:57:37,253
know, like those things matter.

1007
00:57:38,403 --> 00:57:42,693
Matt: Yeah. You know, I, I, if I
was, you know, the, at tech and I

1008
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:45,094
completely echo that sentiment, I
think it's totally correct. Video

1009
00:57:45,153 --> 00:57:49,384
video game industry. Yes. Right.
For as not being a great place to

1010
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:53,978
work. If there was one thing that
I learned working in big tech,

1011
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:57,759
like, uh, you know, going from a
college where you're, know, you

1012
00:57:57,789 --> 00:58:00,398
like, you make this amount of
money, you need a $1,500 raise a

1013
00:58:00,398 --> 00:58:04,358
year and it's unionized and X and
Y and Z. then like, I remember

1014
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:09,079
the week that I. IBM. They flew
me down to Silicon valley for two

1015
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:12,349
weeks. We had this, we had like
this event and there was like

1016
00:58:12,498 --> 00:58:15,528
this music and it was just all
catered and it was all free and

1017
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:19,969
it was crazy the amount of money.
And I got the opportunity to work

1018
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:22,668
with you. It was a really great,
I loved both of those jobs.

1019
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:26,298
Loved, loved, loved both of them.
And I think one of the things

1020
00:58:26,298 --> 00:58:29,329
that I've learned is that of the
things that we want in an

1021
00:58:29,329 --> 00:58:33,443
employer. A really, really strong
indicator is the health of the

1022
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:37,344
business. If you want to, if you
want to work, you know, my, my

1023
00:58:37,403 --> 00:58:42,264
wife works at Shopify. She loves
it there. they have Shopify makes

1024
00:58:42,264 --> 00:58:45,623
so much money that they can hire
people that all they do is think

1025
00:58:45,623 --> 00:58:48,204
about diversity and equity and
they hire another, they have a

1026
00:58:48,204 --> 00:58:51,023
whole team that all they do is
think about culture and they have

1027
00:58:51,023 --> 00:58:54,534
whole teams that do all do
nothing, but, know, run an

1028
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:58,509
internal events and try to make
that a great place to work. You

1029
00:58:58,509 --> 00:59:02,648
know, you can do that if you've
got a ton of money and, you know,

1030
00:59:02,648 --> 00:59:07,869
in terms of diversity in tech, AI
team at Microsoft, um, we were

1031
00:59:08,018 --> 00:59:10,329
extremely diverse by every
standard. We had more women than

1032
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:15,248
men, and that's an AI where like
and data science is enormously

1033
00:59:15,248 --> 00:59:17,378
behind computer science. It's
where computer science was like

1034
00:59:17,378 --> 00:59:22,509
15 years ago. Um, we were able to
have a diverse team at Microsoft

1035
00:59:22,509 --> 00:59:27,878
because we could You know, w we
could go hire the best and the

1036
00:59:27,878 --> 00:59:32,318
best one to work for us. um, we
can afford it. there's a million

1037
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:36,668
other examples like that. So
like, I think going full circle,

1038
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:39,699
lot of ed tech can be a really
tough place to work because

1039
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:43,208
that's a really, really hard
business. And you're, you're

1040
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:47,918
pinching every corner and usually
you are, same with the video game

1041
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:51,338
industry is it is like, you know,
if that game does well,

1042
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:55,358
congratulations. But if it
doesn't it's it's a tough

1043
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:59,043
environment to work in. Um, So,
you know, if you want to have a

1044
00:59:59,043 --> 01:00:01,503
really great place to work, I
think the best, most simple

1045
01:00:01,503 --> 01:00:04,324
indicator you can look at is like
how much money did they raise in

1046
01:00:04,324 --> 01:00:07,264
the last round? If it's a
startup, if it's a publicly big

1047
01:00:07,264 --> 01:00:09,454
publicly traded company, is it
growing, look at their stock

1048
01:00:09,454 --> 01:00:12,784
chart for five years? Does it go
up? You know, if it does probably

1049
01:00:12,784 --> 01:00:16,173
a great place to work, if it's
flat, it, you know, be getting

1050
01:00:16,684 --> 01:00:18,903
like, you might not have budget
to go to that next conference.

1051
01:00:18,963 --> 01:00:22,474
It's uh, you know, and similarly
people might not be attracted to

1052
01:00:22,474 --> 01:00:23,164
work there in the same.

1053
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,201
Bekah: Yeah, I think that's great
advice. Um, I want to thank you

1054
01:00:27,201 --> 01:00:29,601
so much for being here with us
today and having this

1055
01:00:29,601 --> 01:00:33,590
conversation. There's a lot of
really takeaway is I feel like

1056
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:36,860
from all this stuff that we
talked about here, is there

1057
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:40,670
anything that you want to share
before we leave or any last words

1058
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,050
of wisdom for our listeners?

1059
01:00:42,596 --> 01:00:45,476
Matt: No. Thanks everyone. The
thank you in there for having me.

1060
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:48,235
It's a, it's great. If else. I
think one of the things we all

1061
01:00:48,235 --> 01:00:51,385
take away from today is build
personal projects go make stuff

1062
01:00:51,536 --> 01:00:54,925
like, you know, the, the old Y
com motto make, make stuff people

1063
01:00:54,925 --> 01:00:56,396
want, stuff you want.

1064
