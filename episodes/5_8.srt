Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 5, Episode 8

2
00:00:07,615 --> 00:00:09,535
of

3
00:00:09,535 --> 00:00:12,173
the Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

4
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:14,811
that

5
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:18,711
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

6
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:20,136
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

7
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:21,561
their

8
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:24,231
coding journey. And they're
here, on this podcast, sharing

9
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:25,446
their stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

10
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:26,661
it with

11
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:29,262
you. Here with me today is my
co-host, Dan.

12
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:31,000
Dan Ott: Hello, Bekah.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Bekah: Hey, Dan.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,738
Dan: Today, we had [chuckles] a
really- a really fun episode. We

15
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:40,476
sat down with Matt McInnis. He
is a ... I don't know. A data

16
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:42,651
scientist, a full-stack
engineer, a founder, used to be

17
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:44,826
a math

18
00:00:44,826 --> 00:00:48,216
professor. He- he had a real--
he has had a very interesting

19
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:51,667
journey and a very interesting
career. So it was very cool to

20
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:54,411
hear his-- can I just say very a
couple more times [laughs]?

21
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:57,155
I'm

22
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:58,521
excited though. It- it was- it
was- it was a fun time to sit

23
00:00:58,521 --> 00:00:59,886
down

24
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:03,962
with Matt-- I don't know. He's
had a cool career-

25
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:03,962
Bekah: Yeah.

26
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:06,136
Dan: -and so many at different
things he's, like, gotten-

27
00:01:06,136 --> 00:01:08,310
gotten into. And he's

28
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:10,186
built a lot of different things,
and-- yeah. It was fun-- it was

29
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:12,061
a fun

30
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:12,602
conversation.

31
00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:15,581
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, his
journey is super interesting,

32
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:21,432
going from math professor to
working at some really big tech

33
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:23,877
places. And talking about how he
got those jobs by building

34
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:26,292
things

35
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:30,072
that were useful to him, I felt
like was super inspiring to

36
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:33,701
anybody who's trying to break
into tech. But just to see how

37
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:35,426
he developed his career and
followed his interest is really

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,792
... I don't know-- inspiring, I
guess.

39
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:41,921
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. And it-
it hit home for me a lot. It's-

40
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:43,811
it's

41
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:45,641
one of those things that I- I
never did consciously, and I

42
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:48,912
don't think Matt did really
either. He- he was-- he would

43
00:01:48,912 --> 00:01:51,522
build things that would help
him, you know, help himself. So

44
00:01:51,522 --> 00:01:54,611
he talked about what he built,
something that was, like,

45
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:55,000
helping to buy tickets or sell
tickets. And-

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Bekah: Yeah.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,966
Dan: -it wasn't, like, a scheme
to make money or a scheme to get

48
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:02,932
a job [chuckles], you know? It
was just a

49
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:06,470
thing that helped him-- his- his
own, like, life, you know?

50
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,571
He wasn't trying to sell the
product or do any of the things

51
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:10,671
that

52
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:14,301
you hear about these days a lot.
He just was, like, interested

53
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,752
in built something. And then,
some people heard about it. And,

54
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:21,000
well, you'll hear about the rest
[laughs]. But it was cool.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Bekah: [Chuckles] Yeah.

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,396
Dan: It hit home for me. I- I--
that's-- building projects is

57
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:25,792
just, like-- that's- that's--
my-- that's always my

58
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:29,062
advice to people, too, is- is-
is just build things that you're

59
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:32,451
either interested in or could
help yourself. And the rest

60
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,206
will come sort of naturally. So,
it was- it was cool. It was--

61
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:35,961
we--

62
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:37,671
I had a good time talking to
him.

63
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:41,752
Bekah: Yeah. It was fascinating
episode. And we hope that you

64
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:43,222
enjoy it. And we're going to
start it the same way that we

65
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:44,692
start

66
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:48,622
every Virtual Coffee, with our
names, where we're from, what we

67
00:02:48,622 --> 00:03:00,127
do, and our random check-in
question. So, enjoy. Today's

68
00:03:00,152 --> 00:03:03,842
random check-in question is, if
you could appear on any game

69
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:06,347
show, what would it be? I'm
Bekah. I am a technical

70
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:08,852
community

71
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:13,157
builder from a small town in
Ohio. And game show ... I don't

72
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:17,461
know. If there

73
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:19,442
was a "Sudoku" game show, I
would like to try that

74
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:21,422
[chuckles]. I don't think

75
00:03:21,423 --> 00:03:24,000
that's a thing. So, I guess,
I'll go on "Wheel of Fortune"-

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Dan: Peep- pretty--

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,909
Bekah: -or-- I don't know.
"Price Is Right". I feel like

78
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:27,818
I'm-- as

79
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:29,638
an adult, I've

80
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:32,578
gotten better at that. Like
[chuckles], "Oh, I know the

81
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:35,518
price of that." But ...

82
00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:38,038
I don't know. I think I'll stick
with "Wheel of Fortune".

83
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:40,597
Dan: "Wheel of Fortune". Well,
it seemed like a fun- a fun

84
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:42,327
time, you know?

85
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:43,348
Bekah: It doesn't seem so
stressful.

86
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:45,882
Dan: I- I feel like- I feel like
a "Sudoku" game show would be

87
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:48,387
pretty boring to watch
[chuckles], but before

88
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:49,603
they compete it- before they
compete it. But because, well, I

89
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:50,818
can tell--

90
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:52,082
Bekah: I mean, like, some kind
of obstacles they threw in,

91
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:53,297
right?

92
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:53,298
Dan: Ooh.

93
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:55,998
Bekah: Like, what you fill in
one row, then something

94
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:58,668
happened, and you get

95
00:03:58,668 --> 00:04:00,000
slimed. Like [Bekah and Matt
laugh]--

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Dan: Slimed [chuckles].

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,763
Bekah: Did you ever watch
"Double Dare" [chuckles]?

98
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:08,652
Dan: Oh, man. Okay. So, hi. I'm
Dan. I do front-end

99
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:13,252
development—mostly—and live in
Cleveland, and ... oh, yeah,

100
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,723
yeah. Game show "American
Gladiators" is the first thing

101
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,382
that popped into my head.

102
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:18,617
Bekah: Ooh. I did [crosstalk]--
that's what I'm doing [laughs].

103
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,000
Matt McInnis: Oh, how are you
doing, sir?

104
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:21,347
Dan: [Laughs] I- I always wanted
to do-- especially the one--

105
00:04:21,347 --> 00:04:22,622
the-- like,

106
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:25,083
thing I feel like they ended
with it. But the- the watery

107
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,808
run around, shooting the-- like,
the Nerf guns at the, you know,

108
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,533
and

109
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:29,897
the-- like, the- the gladiator
person is up on the top shooting

110
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:31,261
Nerf gun

111
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:32,402
stuff at your tennis [??] balls.
I- I don't really know. I

112
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:33,542
haven't

113
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:34,862
watched it, obviously, in a long
time, but [laughs]--

114
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:37,038
Bekah: "American Ninja Warrior",
too. I forgot. Ugh.

115
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:39,002
Dan: "American Ninja Warrior" is
cool. It-- that seems a lot

116
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:40,382
harder though. But it

117
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:43,293
would be cool to try. I would
definitely try that for sure.

118
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:44,327
Matt: But would you be a
contestant or one of the

119
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,301
gladiators, if you're in the
show?

120
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:47,252
Dan: Well, I mean, now I'd have
to start- I'd have to start as a

121
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:47,253
contestant, you know?

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Matt: Yeah. [Unintelligible].

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,386
Dan: I- I can't-- I'm not gonna
just, like, swoop in and-- you

124
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:52,772
know? I gotta- I gotta earn my-
earn my way up,

125
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,192
right? [Dan and Matt laugh] But
yeah, I feel- I feel like--

126
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:59,551
plus it get the-- well, did

127
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:01,367
the contestants have the ...
what do you call them? Like a

128
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,182
... not a

129
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:05,522
jumpsuit, but the ... we called
these things that-- they were--

130
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,862
or, like, that wrestlers or
anything?

131
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:08,000
Matt: Yeah, I think it's a suit.
I think it's a jumpsuit.

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Dan: No, no, no.

133
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,366
Matt: No, there's a name for it,
isn't that [laughs]? What's the

134
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:10,732
thing? We make it--

135
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,472
Dan: We need Nick here
[chuckles]. What's the thing

136
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:14,702
that like

137
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:16,000
wrestlers wear, like- like--

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Bekah: A singlet?

139
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,262
Dan: Nah-- yes, singlet maybe? I
don't know.

140
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:21,087
Matt: I think there's another
word for it, but it's- it's not

141
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,756
leotards, is it? No.

142
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:26,072
Dan: No. I mean, it's basically
leotard, but it's like singlet.

143
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:26,938
Bekah: It was a singlet. Singlet
is what you're wearing at

144
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:27,583
wrestling.

145
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:29,027
Dan: I don't know [chuckles]. I
don't know. That doesn't sound

146
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,002
right, but you're

147
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:31,597
probably right [Bekah and Matt
laugh]. We- we'll ask Nick

148
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,192
after- after the- after the
podcast [laugh].

149
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,588
Matt: Yeah. I-- good to be here,
guys. Thank you for having

150
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:42,048
me. I'm Matt. I'm a developer
from Toronto, Canada. I run a

151
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:43,562
small company called Typist
where we make educational

152
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:45,076
software. And

153
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:48,497
if I was on one game show, my
first, like—you know, "American

154
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:51,197
Gladiator" wins—but my first
reaction was "Kids Street". It's

155
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:52,862
this old game show. I don't know
if I-- like, if I was 12 years

156
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:54,527
old again,

157
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:56,898
I think it-- you know-- and
everyone kind of clapped over

158
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,322
their head, like, there is this,
like, thing that they did if

159
00:05:58,322 --> 00:05:59,746
they

160
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:01,547
got a question, right? And if
you won, it was, like, every

161
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:03,347
kid's dream. You got to

162
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:05,357
go into, like, this middle
platform. There was like stock,

163
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:07,366
like a toy

164
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,788
store? And you had, like, two
minutes to just grab-

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,788
Dan: Oh, man.

166
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:11,000
Matt: -whatever you wanted.

167
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Bekah: Ooh.

168
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,447
Matt: It was, like-- yeah. So my
sisters and I, we would watch

169
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:15,753
"Kids Street" and we be like,
"How do we get on this TV show?"

170
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:17,028
And we

171
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:20,418
never quite cracked the egg on
that one. It was very- very

172
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:22,577
disappointing childhood, I
guess, you could say [laughs].

173
00:06:22,577 --> 00:06:24,736
Yeah. I'm kidding. But

174
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:26,872
it's a-- yeah, kid's dream. But,
you know-- I, you know, also

175
00:06:26,872 --> 00:06:29,007
second Dan's answer

176
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:29,427
cuz that sounds awesome.

177
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:33,348
Bekah: Wow. I have never seen
"Kids Street" before.

178
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:35,442
Matt: Like-- yeah, there's this
funny kind of Canadian, you

179
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:36,747
know, from

180
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:40,468
Canada. This is funny Canadian
subculture around some

181
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:43,798
things. Like, there are these
really kind of weird things that

182
00:06:43,798 --> 00:06:46,648
pop up every now and then that
are extremely popular. Like,

183
00:06:46,648 --> 00:06:47,947
"Household", everybody knows
them. Even, like, music and

184
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:49,246
bands

185
00:06:49,247 --> 00:06:52,468
sometimes. They were fueled by
this entertainment industry

186
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:53,487
that, like, out of Toronto. But,
like, these companies called

187
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:54,506
MuchMusic,

188
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:57,358
and they're related
subsidiaries, but are just

189
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:59,728
totally unknown in the US. And
it-- which is funny because the

190
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:01,330
US is just a two-hour drive from
where I'm living. Like, it

191
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,932
close, right? Like,

192
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:04,672
we're- we're right there. We- we
go to Buffalo Bills games all

193
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:06,412
the time.

194
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:08,273
It's across this, you know, it
feels like it's across the

195
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:09,503
street. But you go down there,
and they're like, "Oh, they

196
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:10,733
tragically

197
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,353
hip." And it, like, every--
like, you know, half of Canada

198
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:13,973
is all-time

199
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:15,307
favorite band, and people in the
US are like, "Who?" Like,

200
00:07:15,307 --> 00:07:16,641
"Who

201
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:18,247
is that," you know? It's--
there's these things. So "Kids

202
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:19,852
Street" might

203
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:23,273
be one of them too. And, you
know, all these, like, kinda old

204
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:24,262
TV shows for kids, especially.

205
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:27,407
Bekah: Yeah, I need to check it
out. I- I, like, pulled up the--

206
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:29,072
oh, it is a

207
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:32,853
Canadian's children's game show.
So--

208
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:34,927
Matt: It is Canadian. I-- ah,
you guys missed out. This was

209
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:36,756
epic. Like [Bekah laughs]-- and
it would

210
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,047
have been-- it would have,
like-- it would've been way

211
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:39,337
better if the US had done it
[laughs].

212
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:43,462
Like, the mall would have been
cooler. Like, it would have just

213
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:45,427
been-- like- like, production
quality would

214
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:47,557
have been way up there. Like,
where's Nickelodeon at when-

215
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:48,663
Bekah: Yeah.

216
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,327
Matt: -for "Kids Street"
[laughs].

217
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:52,067
Bekah: I love it. It looks very
80s. I need to check this

218
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:52,338
out [chuckles].

219
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:54,048
Matt: Yeah, it was cool
[chuckles].

220
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,827
Bekah: Well, thanks so much for
being here with us today, Matt.

221
00:07:57,858 --> 00:08:02,208
We always like to get started
with your origin stories. So, if

222
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:07,517
you could give us what the story
is that brought you here to

223
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:08,838
today, where you are in tech.

224
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:13,228
Matt: Yeah, thanks. Thank you
for having me, Dan and Bekah.

225
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:14,483
Yeah. You know, I-I guess
it-it-- like, starting--

226
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:15,589
focusing on

227
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:17,801
the tech side of

228
00:08:17,802 --> 00:08:21,973
things, I, you know, graduated--
I did degrees in math. I love

229
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:24,647
math. I think it's still my
Twitter handle [chuckles]. I--

230
00:08:24,647 --> 00:08:27,311
and I-- and, you

231
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:29,502
know, I went-- I decided that,
like, the change I wanna make in

232
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:31,663
the world after graduating was I
wanted to improve the way that

233
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:33,103
people learn mathematics at the
post-secondary level. I- I just,

234
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:34,543
you

235
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:36,560
know, my-- their programs that I
took were massacres. We had

236
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,577
such few people

237
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:42,148
finish relative to how many
started. And, you know, I worked

238
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:44,398
all the way through university,
and math help centers, and as a

239
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:48,298
TA, and I saw people in non-math
disciplines kinda drop out of

240
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:50,368
their, like, early childhood
education program because they

241
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:52,147
couldn't complete their stats
course. And I thought that was

242
00:08:52,147 --> 00:08:53,926
crazy.

243
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:56,538
Because if it's taught properly,
I don't think math is hard,

244
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:58,938
you know? Put that strong
caveat, if it's taught properly.

245
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,128
And so, I

246
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:03,947
really wanted to kind of affect
change there. I took a job. I

247
00:09:03,947 --> 00:09:06,977
applied everywhere for these--
in Canada, we call them 'math

248
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:10,638
professorships' at community
colleges in Canada. In US,

249
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:13,577
it's probably known as a 'math
instructor' at the community--

250
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:16,682
in the community college system.
And so, I took a job in

251
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,302
Saskatchewan. I moved from the
small town of Aurora,

252
00:09:18,302 --> 00:09:19,922
Ontario—where

253
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:23,852
I grew up—to Prince Albert,
Saskatchewan, which is 40,000

254
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:27,662
person town, like, in the-- you
know, it- it was really awesome.

255
00:09:27,663 --> 00:09:29,350
I loved it out there, and I had
some family there too. And

256
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,037
that's

257
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:34,697
where, you know, I- I guess my
journey to tech started. I--

258
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,947
you know, I was a math person. I
really had no experience with

259
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:41,597
tech at that point. I was, you
know, 24 ... 23, 24. And

260
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:44,147
I- I just started wanting to
make things. I remember the

261
00:09:44,147 --> 00:09:46,697
first

262
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:48,437
thing I wanted to make was I had
read, you know, a book that's

263
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:50,177
now very

264
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:51,947
popular, Malcolm Gladwell's
"[The] Tipping Point". And he

265
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:53,717
described,

266
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:56,087
like, "Sesame Street" in the
80s, and how they would, like,

267
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,968
engineer this TV show. They
would bring kids in, and they

268
00:09:57,968 --> 00:09:59,273
would put

269
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:00,458
"Sesame Street" on one screen,
and this thing called the

270
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,643
distractor

271
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:05,182
on the other screen. And every
seven seconds, this

272
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:07,793
distractor would display these
still images that would switch.

273
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:10,283
So, every seven seconds, a
different image. And you'd put,

274
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:11,528
like, 20 kids in the room, and
the researchers would just look

275
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,773
at

276
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:13,732
their eyes and be like, "Are
they looking at the distractor?

277
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:14,691
Are

278
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:15,967
they looking at "Sesame
Street"?" And then, they would

279
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:17,242
go back and

280
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:18,383
they'd graph it after they'd
done, like, a couple of cycles

281
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:19,523
of

282
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:20,797
kids. And they'd see what are
the parts of the TV show that

283
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:22,071
kids

284
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:23,952
were disengaged with, that we
need to re-engineer? And that

285
00:10:23,952 --> 00:10:25,832
was-- like, the

286
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,543
first that I was like, "Man, if
they could do that in the 80s,

287
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,633
why can't, like, in ..." you
know, this was, I guess, like,

288
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,932
2010. I'm like, "Why can't we do
that, like, in real time, live,

289
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,470
while I'm teaching in class?"
And that was-- my first project

290
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,008
was I

291
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:40,427
wanted to build something that
did that. And I had learned that

292
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:43,217
Hasbro had put out this toy
called the hi- like, the Star

293
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:45,302
Wars force trainer, where
everything was ridiculous

294
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:47,387
[chuckles]. So I-- we'd have,
like,

295
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:50,087
a headset that you'd put on. And
it turns out this thing could

296
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:52,337
actually take a-- like, a low
level EEG reading of brain

297
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:54,587
activity, like, if

298
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,440
your brain was active or not.
And then, like, the toy would

299
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,293
connect

300
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:00,153
wirelessly to this base unit
that had a fan, that would spin

301
00:11:00,153 --> 00:11:02,013
a ball

302
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:04,952
up and down in this toy. And so,
it, like—hence the force

303
00:11:04,952 --> 00:11:07,263
trainer—is you concentrate
really hard, and you can use the

304
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:09,528
force to move this ball up and
down [laughs]. Like, really cool

305
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:11,793
toy, right? And I

306
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:13,893
said, "Well, if I could just get
the electrical signal out of

307
00:11:13,893 --> 00:11:16,503
that into my computer and graph
it, that would be the whole

308
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:20,283
thing." And that was my first
foray into tech, was-- I, like,

309
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:21,922
started-- I was like, "Okay.
Well, how do I get the

310
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:22,951
electrical

311
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:26,673
signal out? And how does- how
does electricity work? And how

312
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:29,942
does circuits work?" And, you
know, I learned about

313
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:32,582
microprocessors, and the Arduino
had to-- like, just come out at

314
00:11:32,582 --> 00:11:34,892
the time. And so, I started,
like, getting these, like--

315
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:37,202
yeah, I found that

316
00:11:37,202 --> 00:11:38,252
kids' books for Arduino are
actually way better than the

317
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:39,302
ones they are

318
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:40,547
making for adults. So that-- I
got all these, like, kids'

319
00:11:40,547 --> 00:11:41,792
books and

320
00:11:42,212 --> 00:11:43,882
started, like, doing these
experiments. And then I- I

321
00:11:43,882 --> 00:11:45,552
needed, you

322
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:48,192
know, these wires solder. So I'd
go down to the electrical

323
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:49,287
department and be like, "Hey,
guy. I was teaching, like, math

324
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:50,382
for

325
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:51,643
electricians as part of my job
there." They're like, "Hey, can

326
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:52,903
you do some

327
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:54,328
soldering for me? And, like, put
these--" And it, you know,

328
00:11:54,328 --> 00:11:55,753
at this

329
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:57,388
point, it would, like-- kind of
become this, like, project, and

330
00:11:57,388 --> 00:11:59,023
I gotta

331
00:11:59,023 --> 00:12:03,222
working after-- you know, on the
code side. I learned that

332
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,503
there's this language called
Processing, which was Java based

333
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:06,958
that could do the graphing
pretty easily for me if I could

334
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,023
just

335
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:10,153
pull the signal in. And I got
that working. And then I, you

336
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:12,283
know, like, six

337
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:14,773
months later, presented it at a
conference down in Saskatoon—one

338
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:16,747
of the cities in Saskatchewan.
And at that point, I was hooked.

339
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:18,721
And,

340
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:20,747
you know, from there, I- I
just-- I really wanted to

341
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:22,292
continue making

342
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:23,703
things that would make me a
better teacher. And that drove

343
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:25,113
me

344
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:28,113
for a long time. And then, you
know, a-a couple of years after

345
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:29,748
that, I- I started doing
reflection of what do I want in

346
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,383
terms of a

347
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,047
career, and a lifestyle, and,
like, what are the things I'm

348
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:34,711
after?

349
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,452
And that really kind of led me
to getting interested in, you

350
00:12:36,452 --> 00:12:38,192
know, code

351
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:42,543
as a career. And there weren't
really, you know,

352
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:45,033
bootcamps and Coursera. I don't
even think they had been really

353
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,562
created at that point, or
launched, or, you know, the

354
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:48,091
whole suite of

355
00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:50,582
the EdEx, Udemy, Coursera,
awesome websites for these

356
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:54,363
things, right? So it was a lot
of learning. It was-- I-- you

357
00:12:54,363 --> 00:12:57,092
know, I did that all while I had
a full-time job. And, you know,

358
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:59,492
fast forward a-a number of
years, I launched Typist—the

359
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,892
company I

360
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:03,737
now have run—I made a little
small passion project that I

361
00:13:03,737 --> 00:13:05,581
sometimes call

362
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:10,442
it. At the same time, I-- AI
exploded. And this was maybe

363
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:12,872
six or-- a six-ish-- six, seven
years ago now. At AI, if

364
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:15,302
nothing else,

365
00:13:15,302 --> 00:13:16,922
is a combination of computer
science, and it's, like, a

366
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,542
really strong

367
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:22,682
math background. And, you know,
back then, more emphasis on

368
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:25,113
the math. But today, maybe more
emphasis on the computer science

369
00:13:25,113 --> 00:13:28,165
side. And- and so, I-IBM came
knocking and said, "Hey, we are

370
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:31,217
trying to

371
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,717
hire AI expertise." And I-- and
at that point, I had some

372
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:37,982
projects that, like-- I was
experimenting a lot in AI. And

373
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:40,247
so,

374
00:13:40,248 --> 00:13:42,738
they brought me into-- they
offered me, like, dream job to

375
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,912
go in and be on this new open
source team that they're putting

376
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:47,086
across

377
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:48,767
Canada. And I'd get to work with
all their-- these huge

378
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:50,447
companies, and help

379
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:51,722
them do AI better, and solve
these problems. And that sounded

380
00:13:51,722 --> 00:13:52,997
like a

381
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,480
blast. So I did that for a
number of years. And then later,

382
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,962
I

383
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:59,503
moved over to Microsoft to do a
similar type work, like, more-

384
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:01,633
more hands. I wanted to get
deeper into projects, and

385
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:02,773
Microsoft gave me that
opportunity to go deeper into

386
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:03,913
data

387
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:07,962
science projects with, you know,
companies. And all for

388
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:09,552
free. Like, these companies
would just parachute me in. Or

389
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:11,142
IBM would just--

390
00:14:11,232 --> 00:14:12,657
Microsoft would just parachute
me in, and it's like, "Yeah.

391
00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:14,082
We-- we're

392
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:16,332
gonna help you do data science
better because if you do it on

393
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:17,774
our cloud, we're gonna make a
lot of money." So, I'd get to

394
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,216
go, and just,

395
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:21,768
like, pick my projects, and go
onsite—I get, like, a badge. It

396
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:24,798
was awesome—and-- you know, and
build out these data science

397
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,088
projects, and all the while, on
my evenings and weekends,

398
00:14:26,088 --> 00:14:27,378
building

399
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:29,088
out Typist, trying to get it to
the place where it could

400
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:30,798
support,

401
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,372
you know, a basic income for me,
and I could work on it

402
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,706
full-time,

403
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:38,057
which eventually happened. And-
and, you know, that sort of

404
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:39,990
switch over process was scary
and, you know, different than

405
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,923
I'm-- had

406
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,793
imagined it would be. But
eventually, my boss at Microsoft

407
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:47,382
was like, "Matt, you gotta go do
this. You- you-- it's there."

408
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:48,971
Like, "Go do this

409
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:52,302
thing." And- and I- and I did.
And I-- and that's what I've

410
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:54,253
been working on for the last
three or four years.

411
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:58,785
Bekah: That's- that's amazing. I
have to ask about that switch.

412
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:01,937
Cuz I

413
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:05,327
feel like that sounds like
s-s-s-- very scary [chuckles].

414
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:08,717
Like, giving up all of the

415
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:12,918
stuff that you've been doing
with a team, with all of these

416
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:16,382
resources, and then just jumping
into this entrepreneur journey.

417
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,846
I- I know

418
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:23,687
that you said that you had some
encouragement but, like, what

419
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:27,227
really pushed you to go all in
on Typist?

420
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:31,687
Matt: Ah, you know, it was-- it-
it was really, really hard.

421
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:35,090
You know, I- I- I guess, like,
one of the big factors was I

422
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,253
thought

423
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:43,413
that we- we had a project lined
up for Typist. And- and Typist--

424
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,753
maybe this is the appropriate
time to kinda speak to what it

425
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:50,552
is. We make software for
community college students who

426
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:52,277
are taking a certain set of
courses. So, our- our first

427
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:54,002
product was

428
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:55,990
for community college students
who are taking keyboarding

429
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,977
courses. And

430
00:15:58,008 --> 00:16:00,798
those are people studying
programs to be law clerks, or

431
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:02,957
legal assistance, medical
assistance, or even executive

432
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:04,862
assistants. And very-- and, you
know, there's interesting

433
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:06,767
demographics

434
00:16:06,768 --> 00:16:09,197
in those programs, such as-- a
reason I'm really passionate to

435
00:16:09,197 --> 00:16:13,638
work on and honored to build
software for that group. And

436
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:15,182
then we have this second
product, which at that point,

437
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,726
Bekah, was--

438
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,852
I was really-- we had scoped it
out. And it was the-- and this

439
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:22,527
thing called

440
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:25,408
'document production'. So, you
know, people that go in these

441
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:26,757
fields need to be able to make a
professionally formatted

442
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:28,106
business

443
00:16:28,107 --> 00:16:30,778
letter that has these exact
traits and the-- it's sort of a

444
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:34,827
vocational skill. And in that
particular field, it's rated as,

445
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,567
like, a top three employment
skill to-- by all every

446
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:38,307
industry

447
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:41,278
survey that's ever been done.
And it's really, really hard to

448
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,952
teach. And I-- we had-- one of
the colle- I've been, like,

449
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:47,912
kinda kicking the tires with the
people who are using our

450
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:48,872
keyboarding

451
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:49,993
software, and be like, "Hey,
does anyone wanna partner to

452
00:16:49,993 --> 00:16:51,113
build this with us?

453
00:16:51,373 --> 00:16:52,927
And by partner, just, like, give
us feedback, tell us- tell us

454
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:54,481
what

455
00:16:54,482 --> 00:16:56,102
to build, like whiteboard. And-
and ideally, if we build you

456
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,722
something

457
00:16:57,722 --> 00:16:59,732
that you really liked, be the,
you know, the person to use it

458
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:01,742
and give us

459
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:04,952
the reference so that we can
maybe expand this." And I-- and

460
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:06,017
that was a big part of the
decision was I had all that

461
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:07,022
lined

462
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:11,883
up. And so, for the six to seven
months prior to that—and

463
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:15,423
this was the final push—I had
outsourced the development of it

464
00:17:15,423 --> 00:17:17,837
to a really great developer
who-- it-- like, grades-- you

465
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,251
know,

466
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:24,992
really, really talented Rails
developer. And we had a

467
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:28,323
prototype. And we went back to
this college and presented this.

468
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:30,153
And I'd take vacation days
anytime I had to go take

469
00:17:30,153 --> 00:17:31,682
meetings, right? So, all of my
vacation for those, like, four

470
00:17:31,682 --> 00:17:33,211
years was

471
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:36,272
consumed by Typist. And so, I'd
take a vacation day. I'd go,

472
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:37,607
and we'd present this back to
the group. And they had said,

473
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:38,942
"Yes. If

474
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,012
you can build it, and it can do
these things, but we need these

475
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:45,573
changes, you know, we'll use
it." But at that point, I looked

476
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:47,703
with-- like- like, how we had
constructed the software. And I

477
00:17:47,703 --> 00:17:49,833
said, "It's not

478
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,618
gonna get us to the finish
line." We were, you know--

479
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:53,403
specifically, we'd

480
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:55,008
built it in Rails, and it--
like, it all works with file IO.

481
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,613
So, either you

482
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:58,358
need to upload this file, and
then we would go compare it to

483
00:17:58,358 --> 00:18:00,093
this

484
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:03,032
other file. And they're both
Word documents, which are

485
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:03,033
incredibly hard to work with.

486
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

487
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,004
Matt: And we, like-- you know,
the- the way all the existing

488
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:10,008
previous software, like, if
there's a typo in a paragraph,

489
00:18:10,248 --> 00:18:12,647
you lost all the marks of the
paragraph because doing fuzzy

490
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:13,712
matching is, like, really,
really hard. And we just-- I- I

491
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:14,777
sat

492
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:16,907
there

493
00:18:16,907 --> 00:18:18,077
and I'm like, "We can't do this
in our web server. This-- it

494
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:19,247
takes, like, 20

495
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:20,912
seconds to process a single
file. We'll be in classes,

496
00:18:20,912 --> 00:18:22,576
they'll do a test,

497
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:24,512
they'll get 30 uploads at once.
We'll never be able to handle

498
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:25,742
the spike in

499
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:27,027
traffic, we'll never be able
to-- we- we don't wanna web

500
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:28,312
server

501
00:18:28,313 --> 00:18:29,938
sitting idle for it." And I
just—long story short—knew, and

502
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:31,563
I-- we had to

503
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:34,442
rebuild the software completely
from scratch. And we had five

504
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:37,432
months to do it. We had gone in
and already produced, like-- we

505
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:38,732
already done the demo and been
like, "Yeah, it's working.

506
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:40,022
Look."

507
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:42,722
And I knew that we had to throw
away everything that we'd done,

508
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,962
and build it from scratch, and--
which we did. So, that was,

509
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:48,122
like, the imme- there's an
immediacy which helped, I guess,

510
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:50,282
make that decision

511
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:51,827
of, like, I'd-- like-- so, when
I went in and had that

512
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:53,372
conversation with

513
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:55,082
my wonderful, wonderful boss, I
was scay [??], and I was

514
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:56,791
explaining

515
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:59,267
this all to her. She's like--
I'm- I'm like-- I was scay

516
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:01,742
[??], I've like, "If

517
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:05,133
we're gonna launch this thing
and this could push Typist over

518
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:08,522
the mark of, like, it could
support a couple employees,

519
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:11,238
I've got to go now. Like, I- I-
I can't wait till next week.

520
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:13,008
I've- I've got to

521
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:17,357
start, right now." And she's
like, "Yep, do it." And at that

522
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,947
point, I ... like, almost on the
spot gave my notice. I talked to

523
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:20,537
my

524
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:25,788
wife and- and that was the jump.
And it was a hard summer, by the

525
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:26,087
way [chuckles]. It was tough.

526
00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:29,848
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that's
pretty intense. [Chuckles] I

527
00:19:29,848 --> 00:19:31,223
mean, obviously I don't [Dan and
Matt chuckle] ...

528
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:37,114
but it seems like it worked out,
right? I mean, kinda betting

529
00:19:37,114 --> 00:19:38,000
on yourself and-- I mean, it-

530
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Matt: Yeah.

531
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,351
Dan: -might be wasn't much of a
bet. Have you-- did you have a

532
00:19:41,351 --> 00:19:43,702
good idea of-- so, you said you
had to, you know, tear it down

533
00:19:43,702 --> 00:19:46,053
and- and rebuild

534
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:48,108
it. Did you have a good idea at
that, like, moment of, like,

535
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:50,162
what it was

536
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:52,713
gonna look like when you were
finished rebuilding it or were

537
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:55,173
you just like, "We have," like,
"are-- start from scratch, and I

538
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:55,923
have no idea," you know?

539
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:58,239
Matt: Yeah. We- we knew that,
and- and I did. And maybe, you

540
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,394
know, I-- and

541
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:01,963
I'm happy to speak to the--
kinda the details of it, because

542
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:03,000
I think they're interesting if
that's-- you know?

543
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Bekah: Yeah, sure.

544
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Dan: Yeah.

545
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,392
Matt: So, like, we-- you know, I
mentioned we couldn't do this on

546
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:09,784
web servers. Because, like, you

547
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:11,209
know, the really simple use case
was that if 20 students are

548
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,634
doing

549
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:13,698
a test, and they all upload
their documents at once, and

550
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:14,762
they take

551
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:16,593
25 seconds to process, web
servers just can't do that. We

552
00:20:16,593 --> 00:20:18,423
would have

553
00:20:18,423 --> 00:20:21,243
to have, like, this incredible
scale that would just be so

554
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:26,709
expensive, we couldn't run the
business. And so, the-- my-

555
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,248
my theory was that we needed a
couple of things. We needed to

556
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:31,537
not be

557
00:20:31,538 --> 00:20:33,293
using Ruby because, like, a- a
Node based system made a lot

558
00:20:33,293 --> 00:20:35,048
more

559
00:20:35,048 --> 00:20:38,078
sense in the way that a Node
event loop works, you know? And-

560
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,308
and the second thing was we
needed a way to deploy these

561
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,433
sort of algorithms that we were
building in a way that can

562
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:44,558
handle

563
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,534
these spikes in traffic, and at
that point, sort of lamb- this

564
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:51,773
Lambda architecture. Which is,
you know, all the clouds have a

565
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:53,408
product for this. So, in
Microsoft is called Azure

566
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:55,043
functions, in AWS

567
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:57,518
is called Lambda, in-- you can
have-- net- Netlify just

568
00:20:57,518 --> 00:20:59,992
launched one, I

569
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:02,034
think, actually, and Cloudflare
has one called Cloudflare

570
00:21:02,034 --> 00:21:03,728
functions too. But they
basically work that, like,

571
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:05,422
something happens,

572
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:06,863
and these-- they spin up your
code, and they do the thing you

573
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:08,303
want it to do, and

574
00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:11,394
then they spin down, and you can
throw a thousand at them. And

575
00:21:11,423 --> 00:21:13,673
they, you know, a thousand
instances will spit up, you'll

576
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,350
pay for the time they're up, and
then, they'll turn off, and

577
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,027
you're done. And so,

578
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:19,023
that was kind of what I knew was
that we had to rewrite this into

579
00:21:19,023 --> 00:21:20,958
that--

580
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:23,898
this Lambda type architecture
that could handle these spikes.

581
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:25,753
We had to use-- we had to switch
languages. So, we had to

582
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:27,077
use a

583
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,368
language that was compatible
there in-- while supported, and

584
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:29,658
Ruby

585
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:31,398
wasn't supported at all. So that
had to go to JavaScript. And

586
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:33,137
then

587
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:35,628
there was, you know—to your
question, Dan—there- there were

588
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,688
questions that I was really,
really concerned about, which

589
00:21:37,688 --> 00:21:39,748
were, "how

590
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:41,698
are we going to go in and, like,
that problem on evaluation?" So,

591
00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:43,647
if

592
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:44,188
you're a student, you upload
this document, and you're off

593
00:21:44,188 --> 00:21:45,808
by, like,

594
00:21:45,808 --> 00:21:49,229
two characters, we couldn't take
off all of the marks, right? So

595
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:52,648
we had to be able to go in and
compare the texts. We expected

596
00:21:52,648 --> 00:21:54,328
students to type in the text
that they did type, and take off

597
00:21:54,328 --> 00:21:56,008
some of-- like, of-- like,

598
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:00,028
type of marks of as proportions
to do that, and give meaningful

599
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,398
feedback on the other side. And
at that point, I had no idea how

600
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:07,433
we're gonna solve that problem.
Yeah, which we, you know, later

601
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:10,463
figured out a way to. And even
just converting, like, how do we

602
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,188
even-- so, you know—just as a
quick comment—DOCX files are

603
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:13,913
really

604
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:15,834
hard to work with, but here's,
like, a fun thing you can do.

605
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,574
If you're on a Windows machine,
take a DOCX file to your

606
00:22:17,574 --> 00:22:19,314
desktop, rename

607
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:22,314
it to '.zip'. And then, extract
it, and you'll see the general

608
00:22:22,314 --> 00:22:25,314
how these struck-

609
00:22:25,913 --> 00:22:27,233
files are structured. In-
inside, there is all this kind

610
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:28,553
of markup

611
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:30,324
that will be a little bit
familiar to you if you've seen

612
00:22:30,324 --> 00:22:34,163
XML or HTML before. And you can
see all the stuff in there.

613
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:35,573
So we knew that we had to, like,
deal with that problem too,

614
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:36,983
which

615
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:39,503
we didn't know how we were gonna
handle because we were using

616
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:41,933
these Ruby libraries that kind
of abstracted that away for us.

617
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:46,283
Bekah: Mm. Yeah. So you made
this career journey, I guess.

618
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,563
So, from

619
00:22:48,564 --> 00:22:54,443
math, and then you were doing
AI, data science stuff, and then

620
00:22:54,653 --> 00:23:00,324
Rails back-end stuff, and- and
now JavaScript and React, right?

621
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,999
Matt: Yeah. And- and, you know,
I think the first part of that

622
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:07,838
would be like it's worth
expanding on, like, it was--

623
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:12,601
like, when I started learning
code, it, like-- I-- you know,

624
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,601
data science is generally on in
Python and R. Like, those are

625
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:13,854
the

626
00:23:13,854 --> 00:23:17,034
language for data science, and
heavy emphasis on Python these

627
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:20,394
days. Like, academic, C's are.
But nobody else really does.

628
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,523
And so the-- like, I really
didn't know a ton of Python, but

629
00:23:22,523 --> 00:23:24,113
it's

630
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:27,834
such an approachable language. I
really-- that-- like, that seven

631
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:30,266
years of learning code, like,
you know, I- I breezed past it

632
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:32,698
in a

633
00:23:32,699 --> 00:23:35,699
sentence, but that was really
hard. It was a lot of evenings

634
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:39,419
and weekends. I was working full
time that whole time. I, at some

635
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,174
points, had, like, even taking
on contract gigs, doing

636
00:23:41,174 --> 00:23:42,929
statistical

637
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:46,979
consulting for some stuff. And-
and it was webdev that I was

638
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:50,097
learning during that time,
Bekah. And it was, you know, I

639
00:23:50,098 --> 00:23:52,375
had started the-- with a-- like
[chuckles], you know, I started

640
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,652
with HTML, and

641
00:23:54,653 --> 00:23:56,303
CSS, and had-- like, learned
that, and built a personal

642
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:57,953
website. And

643
00:23:57,953 --> 00:24:00,473
it was, like, you know, these
projects, all the way through,

644
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:02,768
like, I wanted-- like, at the
time people were downloading TV

645
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:05,063
shows,

646
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:06,788
and movies, and stuff, maybe
[chuckles], you know, maybe they

647
00:24:06,788 --> 00:24:08,512
shouldn't. But it

648
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:09,833
was, like, really hard. So,
like, if I wanted to go-- if I

649
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,153
download the new season

650
00:24:11,513 --> 00:24:12,743
of "The Office", I wanted to
search "The Office", and have it

651
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:13,973
organized,

652
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:15,488
like, Episode 1, Episode 2,
Episode 3, and then get rid of

653
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:17,003
the ones that were,

654
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:18,766
like, somebody holding their
camera, and do others, so does

655
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:20,438
a website

656
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:25,088
to do that. And it was, like, so
basic. It was a single PHP file

657
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:27,354
that just went and, like, kind
of scraped the Pirate Bay, and

658
00:24:27,354 --> 00:24:29,259
then

659
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:33,428
analyze the file names. And
then, I- I had no idea how to

660
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:35,049
use databases, so it would just
stick the results [chuckles]

661
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:36,669
into, like, a text

662
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:38,926
file [laughs]. I'm like, "Go,
daddy." So it was-- like,

663
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:41,184
that's where I was starting
from. And-

664
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Dan: That's awesome.

665
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,057
Matt: -it was-- so, there's--
like, there's that. There were

666
00:24:45,057 --> 00:24:48,114
... oh-- like, oh my god.
There's so many other. Like,

667
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:50,304
another one that was fun was
when I was teaching at the

668
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:52,638
college, you'd put all your
marks into, like, an Excel doc.

669
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:54,972
So I was like,

670
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:56,248
"Okay. Well, I want, like, to
give my students more contextual

671
00:24:56,248 --> 00:24:57,523
feedback

672
00:24:57,523 --> 00:24:58,588
on how they're doing in the
course." So I put it into a

673
00:24:58,588 --> 00:24:59,653
Google

674
00:24:59,653 --> 00:25:00,628
doc, and I was like, "How do I
get this thing to send email?"

675
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:01,603
And

676
00:25:01,604 --> 00:25:02,383
then, that was, like-- one of
the first things I had written

677
00:25:02,383 --> 00:25:03,162
in

678
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:06,614
JavaScript was to, like, go take
all my students. And if they're,

679
00:25:06,614 --> 00:25:08,308
like-- if they've not done well
on the first two quizzes, send

680
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:10,002
them

681
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:13,523
an email that's like, "Hey, you
know, John. I- I saw you didn't

682
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:15,594
do very well in the first few
quizzes. Here are my office

683
00:25:15,594 --> 00:25:16,944
hours. There's also the math
help center if you need support.

684
00:25:16,944 --> 00:25:18,294
I'm

685
00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:19,883
here for you," like, you know,
like, "really wanna help you

686
00:25:19,883 --> 00:25:21,472
turn

687
00:25:21,473 --> 00:25:22,628
this around [chuckles]." And
then, if they were doing really

688
00:25:22,628 --> 00:25:23,783
well, they'd get,

689
00:25:23,784 --> 00:25:25,148
like, a more positive note with
different content. And there

690
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,512
were-- I had, like,

691
00:25:26,513 --> 00:25:27,443
six different templates. And
then, I would just hit go, and

692
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:28,373
then

693
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:29,558
everybody would get an email
from me, and, like, my five

694
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:30,742
[unintelligible] sections or

695
00:25:30,743 --> 00:25:31,074
whatever. I [laughs]--

696
00:25:33,084 --> 00:25:35,288
Bekah: [Laughs] I- I- I need
that 10 years ago. That would

697
00:25:35,288 --> 00:25:37,492
save me so much

698
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:40,044
time. Wow. That's amazing.

699
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:42,203
Matt: It's great. But, like, the
part that I felt guilty about,

700
00:25:42,203 --> 00:25:43,433
Bekah, it was I'd get

701
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:44,963
these responses, and be like,
"Wow. You-- thank you for

702
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:46,493
taking the time to

703
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:49,763
write me this email." [All
laughs] Yeah. You know- you

704
00:25:49,763 --> 00:25:53,033
know? I-- it was-- but they
were, like--

705
00:25:53,673 --> 00:25:56,283
Bekah: I thought that's a--
wait. Is that not a product for

706
00:25:56,284 --> 00:25:58,713
teachers? Because if it's not,
it totally should be.

707
00:25:58,713 --> 00:25:58,933
Matt: It should be.

708
00:25:58,933 --> 00:25:59,263
Dan: Was it just, like-- that's
like-

709
00:25:59,423 --> 00:25:59,874
Matt: Yeah.

710
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:01,634
Dan: -a CRM, right? A CRM—except
for students—is, like,

711
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:03,374
you have

712
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:04,798
all the automated- automated
mail campaigns and stuff, you

713
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:06,222
know [laughs]?

714
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:09,044
Except, you're-- except, you're
emailing students. It's amazing.

715
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:09,614
Bekah: Yes. Yeah. Okay. But
this-- I [Matt laughs] need to

716
00:26:09,614 --> 00:26:10,124
Google this after we're done.
Because-

717
00:26:10,243 --> 00:26:10,973
Dan: It has to exist.

718
00:26:11,443 --> 00:26:14,324
Bekah: -if- if it is a thing, I
need to tell everybody that I

719
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,469
know—that still a teacher—about
it. And if not, then

720
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:19,124
that's my new project
[chuckles].

721
00:26:19,838 --> 00:26:21,248
Matt: Yeah. It's-- you know--
so, that was, like-- there were

722
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:22,658
these

723
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:25,449
projects on the way, right? And
they were all usually connected

724
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:27,788
to something I wanted to see in
the world. Like-- and another

725
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:29,288
really big one I took on, that
was, like, less code, but it

726
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,788
was, you know,

727
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:34,388
it was-- my first experience
with Rails was, you know, we

728
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:36,315
had-- I was teaching at the
college, and I was helping to

729
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:38,242
volunteer

730
00:26:38,243 --> 00:26:40,374
coach this marketing team, which
I don't know what I was

731
00:26:40,374 --> 00:26:44,334
doing there. I was, like, the
math guy, right? And I-- but I

732
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:46,644
wanted to get my students more
experiencing the actual-- like,

733
00:26:46,644 --> 00:26:47,708
the part of marketing that
really is interesting to me is

734
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:48,772
the

735
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,894
analytics of it. There's really
rich analytics and the math is

736
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:54,038
just super fun to look at. But
there is-- like, Google

737
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:56,182
Analytics

738
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:57,428
was out there at the time. But
it was really hard to get

739
00:26:57,428 --> 00:26:58,673
experience

740
00:26:58,673 --> 00:26:59,618
with actual data. So I thought,
"Well, what if we could get,

741
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,563
like, a

742
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:03,864
website up that would, you know,
have a bunch of data that

743
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:05,303
students could just mess around
with? And we could, like, do

744
00:27:05,303 --> 00:27:06,742
stuff.

745
00:27:06,743 --> 00:27:09,503
We could go put posters up and
drive traffic." And- and then--

746
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:11,813
like, I was also really
interested in—and still am—in

747
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:14,124
volunteerism. And I said, "You
know, I've had these great,

748
00:27:14,124 --> 00:27:16,794
wonderful, like, life-changing
experience volunteering. Like,

749
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:21,804
you know, what if we could drive
more volunteers to charities?"

750
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:25,074
And, you know, I was also really
attracted to short video format.

751
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:27,579
So, I sorta took the summer off
and I emailed the-- sort of

752
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,084
CEOs of

753
00:27:30,263 --> 00:27:32,168
charities in Toronto, and said,
"Hey, I- I went on, you know,

754
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:34,073
Facebook and

755
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:36,144
Craigslist trying to find a
videographer who involved here

756
00:27:36,144 --> 00:27:39,232
with me." And I did. And we
went-- my- my pitch was like,

757
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:41,483
"Hey, we're gonna take your CEO.
We're gonna go onsite where

758
00:27:41,483 --> 00:27:44,034
volunteerism is happening. We're
gonna shoot, like, a 45 second

759
00:27:44,034 --> 00:27:46,973
to one minute video of you
telling volunteers why it would

760
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:48,713
be so great to volunteer with
your-- their-- your

761
00:27:48,713 --> 00:27:50,453
organization." And we did that.

762
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:52,793
And we did, like, five of the
biggest charities in Toronto.

763
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:54,459
And we put them on a website I
call [chuckles]-- that I called

764
00:27:54,459 --> 00:27:56,124
'Where The Good Is'. And

765
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:58,074
then we took the marketing ever
since. We promoted it around the

766
00:27:58,074 --> 00:27:59,498
college, and then, like, we'd
Google in with [unintelligible],

767
00:27:59,498 --> 00:28:00,922
that they would,

768
00:28:00,923 --> 00:28:03,203
like, drive the traffic to the
website, we got to analyze it

769
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:04,793
all. And it was really fun. And
that was, like, my first website

770
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:06,383
in

771
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,023
Rails. It was a static web page
with just a bunch of videos, but

772
00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:11,258
it was a great way to learn.
And- and- and there's probably,

773
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:13,253
like, a million

774
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:15,361
other projects that a little,
you know, similar. But those--

775
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,469
that's what I was learning. That

776
00:28:17,618 --> 00:28:20,169
seven years was-- I was really
getting into web development. I

777
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:24,128
loved it. I loved making things.
And the more relevant they were

778
00:28:24,128 --> 00:28:26,303
for me, the better. And, you
know, my last one, which was,

779
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:28,478
like,

780
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:31,537
a full Rails app—that was just a
static page, right?—was this--

781
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:33,368
I wanted a Chrome extension. So,
my wife, my-- who was my

782
00:28:33,368 --> 00:28:35,198
girlfriend

783
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:37,598
at the time, we could just hit a
button in Chrome, and we could

784
00:28:37,598 --> 00:28:39,308
share the webpage that we're
looking at with, like, a little

785
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:41,739
note. And it would just, like,
jumped to the other person's

786
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:43,196
browser. And so, I built a
little app that did that. And

787
00:28:43,196 --> 00:28:44,653
that was, like,

788
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:47,908
the first, you know, full ...
like, real, meaningful, like,

789
00:28:47,908 --> 00:28:51,163
web app, you

790
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,458
know? Like, they did stuff on
the back end and use the

791
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,753
database. And- and, you

792
00:28:55,753 --> 00:28:58,663
know, during that time also,
courses started coming out. So

793
00:28:58,663 --> 00:29:01,513
I took wonderful database course
from Stanford, and then, the

794
00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:04,993
University of Washington has
amazing courses. And- and

795
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,824
that allowed me to kinda get to
the bottom of how these things

796
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:09,969
worked, which I was incredibly
curious about. Like, the

797
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:11,828
hardware/software interface
course from the University of

798
00:29:11,828 --> 00:29:12,773
Washington is just straight up
one of the best courses I've

799
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:13,718
ever taken.

800
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,114
Like-- it's, like, how it--
like, it tackles the problem

801
00:29:15,114 --> 00:29:16,509
of--

802
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:19,749
like, how does the code you type
in Python change things in a

803
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:22,358
computer and how does the
computer work it all? And that

804
00:29:22,358 --> 00:29:25,568
was, like, the missing gap that
I needed to kind of address. And

805
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:29,189
that was a wonderful experience.
And- and yeah, that's what--

806
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:31,778
like, that seven years was like.
And- and then, towards the end

807
00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:33,188
of it, the- the project that I
made—that kind of got the

808
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,598
attention of IBM—was,

809
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:37,448
I had, like-- had-- this is
[chuckles]- this is-- am I-

810
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:39,759
am I rambling here? I feel like
I'm talking about--

811
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:40,509
Bekah: No. This is great.

812
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:40,509
Dan: No.

813
00:29:41,078 --> 00:29:43,418
Matt: The hat-- I-- the ever big
baseball fan, I've got my

814
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:45,758
little

815
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,214
Blue Jays hat in the background
on- on the yellow shirt behind

816
00:29:47,214 --> 00:29:48,669
me.

817
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:50,738
And- and we love going to the
Home Opener—which is the first

818
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:52,807
baseball

819
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:55,643
game of the year. And I had
gone, and we buy tickets, but

820
00:29:55,643 --> 00:29:58,117
they always

821
00:29:58,118 --> 00:30:00,338
sell out. So you have to buy
resale. And resales, like, three

822
00:30:00,338 --> 00:30:02,393
times the price. And we paid--
that one year, we paid, like,

823
00:30:02,393 --> 00:30:05,948
$110—which was outrageous at the
time—to sit in, like, $20

824
00:30:05,948 --> 00:30:07,328
seats at, like,

825
00:30:07,328 --> 00:30:09,138
the top of the stadium. And I
was so upset by this, you know?

826
00:30:09,138 --> 00:30:12,679
I was. Really. And then, you
know, one of my friends can

827
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:14,409
come. So I

828
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:15,936
had to-- like, I tried to scalp
the ticket. So, I was, like,

829
00:30:15,936 --> 00:30:17,463
outside the

830
00:30:17,463 --> 00:30:19,218
stadium [Bekah giggles] instead
of like-- and I, like, had, you

831
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:20,973
know, a couple of

832
00:30:21,273 --> 00:30:23,223
bottles of juice to give myself
the courage to do it [Matt and

833
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:25,173
Dan laugh]. And- and so, I'm-
I'm

834
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:26,989
standing outside the stadium
with my best cover, and I was

835
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:28,144
like, "Tickets?

836
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:31,308
[Bekah laughs] Do you guys need
tickets?" And I remember,

837
00:30:31,308 --> 00:30:34,443
there's this-- I'd-- like, of
all-- there's 50,000

838
00:30:34,443 --> 00:30:36,304
people there—of course—like, a
friend walks by, and he's like,

839
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:38,824
"What in the hell are you
doing?" and-- "What in the heck

840
00:30:38,824 --> 00:30:40,398
you do?" And then, I'll--
there-- I never forget this mom

841
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:41,972
and her daughter. The

842
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,768
daughter must've been, like, 17,
18 years old, right? And

843
00:30:43,768 --> 00:30:45,563
they're- they're walking

844
00:30:45,564 --> 00:30:47,273
by, and I'm out there just,
"Tickets?" [Bekah chuckles] And,

845
00:30:47,273 --> 00:30:48,982
"You need a ticket?" And she's
so

846
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:51,578
politely says, "No, thank you."
Everyone just ignores it, and

847
00:30:51,578 --> 00:30:54,173
she just, "No, thank you." And
she looks at me, and then

848
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:57,324
looks down at my shirt, and I've
got my University Western shirt

849
00:30:57,324 --> 00:30:59,094
on [Bekah chuckles], and she
doesn't-- like, her face just

850
00:30:59,094 --> 00:31:00,864
drops. And she looks at

851
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,818
her daughter who's, like, also
got a Western shirt- [Matt and

852
00:31:03,818 --> 00:31:06,772
Bekah laugh] shirt on. It just
had this,

853
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:08,843
like, sad look of horror as they
walk into this thing, you

854
00:31:08,843 --> 00:31:10,913
know? Like, "This

855
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:13,353
is what my daughter is gonna
be." I've-- but anyways, that

856
00:31:13,353 --> 00:31:15,793
whole

857
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:19,213
experience has really upsetting.
And so, I'm, like-- well, you

858
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:22,903
know, I learned that if you
bought season tickets for, like,

859
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:26,233
all 90 games in a season, then
you would get, like, a 15%

860
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:29,533
discount,

861
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:31,348
and then I could get the $20
ticket. And so, of course, you

862
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,162
know,

863
00:31:33,294 --> 00:31:36,223
what- what's a reasonable thing
to do is spend $9,000 on season

864
00:31:36,223 --> 00:31:39,913
tickets. Yeah. So I basically
took 2/3 of my savings in

865
00:31:39,913 --> 00:31:42,864
my bank account, and I funded
the money on season tickets. But

866
00:31:42,864 --> 00:31:47,213
my theory was, I could sell them
at face value to my friends. And

867
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:50,124
since I got this, like, 15%
discount, that would more than

868
00:31:50,124 --> 00:31:52,058
make up for the gap. And- and
Pam and I could go to, like,

869
00:31:52,058 --> 00:31:53,992
three

870
00:31:53,993 --> 00:31:57,114
or four games for free—which is
all I really wanted. And-- but

871
00:31:57,114 --> 00:31:59,273
to do that, I needed to figure
out how to price all these

872
00:31:59,273 --> 00:32:01,710
tickets. And so, I wrote a
Electron desktop app that went

873
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,147
and scraped

874
00:32:04,148 --> 00:32:06,759
all the data from bluejays.com,
and scraped all the data from

875
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,813
StubHub, and I wrote an
algorithm to-- it, like-- you

876
00:32:08,813 --> 00:32:10,867
know, if you scrape

877
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:12,848
StubHub one day, and you scrape
the next day, you can figure out

878
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,648
what tickets are not there
anymore. And then, you can

879
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:15,000
figure out what's sold and for
what price-

880
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Bekah: Oh, wow.

881
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,054
Matt: -since you knew [??] all
the things. And so, I built a

882
00:32:18,054 --> 00:32:20,108
really nice clean data set, and
then I

883
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:23,558
trained an algorithm to price my
tickets. And, you know,

884
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:26,104
again, I have this Electron app.
And I just click a button, it'll

885
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:29,614
price on my tickets, send an
email to my friends, and- and

886
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:34,294
then people just earmarked what
tickets I want. And- and it

887
00:32:34,294 --> 00:32:35,944
worked. And I did that for, you
know, I've been doing that for

888
00:32:35,944 --> 00:32:37,594
four,

889
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:39,484
five years now-- or six years, I
guess. This is-- there's, like,

890
00:32:39,484 --> 00:32:43,564
two year gap that I, you know,
decided not to do it because of

891
00:32:43,564 --> 00:32:47,824
COVID. And- and then, that got
the attention of IBM. I

892
00:32:47,824 --> 00:32:49,339
mean, like, "Hey, that's a
really awesome project." And

893
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:50,854
that's what

894
00:32:50,854 --> 00:32:52,296
kind of opened that door. But it
was, you know [laughs], all

895
00:32:52,296 --> 00:32:53,738
these--

896
00:32:55,423 --> 00:32:58,258
Bekah: That's-- when I- when I
was leaving education to come

897
00:32:58,258 --> 00:33:03,883
into tech, I made money. I- I
remember the most money I made,

898
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:06,672
I bought and

899
00:33:06,673 --> 00:33:09,183
resold Justin Bieber tickets on
StubHub [Bekah and Matt laugh].

900
00:33:09,183 --> 00:33:11,693
And it was a lot of

901
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:15,683
research. Again, that would have
been something that would have

902
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:17,784
been very useful to me during
that time.

903
00:33:18,189 --> 00:33:18,699
Matt: Oh, yeah.

904
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:20,739
Bekah: Wow, that's amazing.
Justin Bieber also made me a lot

905
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:22,644
of money, so I

906
00:33:22,644 --> 00:33:24,263
don't hate Justin Bieber. He's
great [chuckles].

907
00:33:24,814 --> 00:33:27,334
Matt: He's Canadian, yeah. He's
from down the road there. The--

908
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:28,054
Bekah: That's right [laughs].

909
00:33:28,594 --> 00:33:30,364
Matt: And we have a lot of mixed
feelings about Justin Bieber.

910
00:33:30,364 --> 00:33:33,079
But they're generally positive.
He's- he's doing his best [Matt

911
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:35,794
and Bekah laugh]. I'm glad he
did well by you, Bekah.

912
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:35,973
That's good.

913
00:33:37,644 --> 00:33:40,261
Bekah: Yeah. Wow. That-- there
... I don't know what to say

914
00:33:40,261 --> 00:33:42,878
other than that's

915
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:45,083
amazing. And oh, what I did
wanna say was, for-- we have a

916
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:47,288
lot

917
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:50,679
of people who are listening to
the podcast, who are coming into

918
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,434
tech, and I really love all
these stories that you're

919
00:33:52,434 --> 00:33:54,189
telling

920
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:58,328
because all of the things that
you made were useful to you, and

921
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:01,269
they made sense for you to make.
And so, there's always that

922
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:02,423
question of like, "Well, what am
supposed to be doing? And what

923
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:03,577
am

924
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:07,199
I supposed to be building?" And
you- you don't have to build an

925
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:08,848
Electron app that analyzes what
to price your Blue Jays tickets

926
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:10,497
at [laughs], but,

927
00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:13,198
like, find that thing that's
meaningful, and then go for

928
00:34:13,198 --> 00:34:15,418
that,

929
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,233
and- and see where that takes
you, and who notices you based

930
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:19,048
on that.

931
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:23,178
Matt: Totally. And, you know, I
have a- a friend-- I've- I've

932
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:26,208
had these experiences where I--
you know, while I was at the

933
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:27,513
college, Bekah and Dan. I-- you
know, I connected with this

934
00:34:27,513 --> 00:34:28,818
group

935
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:30,768
called Hacker Paradise that
facilitates these remote sort of

936
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,718
work

937
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,518
experiences. And they were, you
know-- it turns out that was

938
00:34:34,518 --> 00:34:36,317
really impactful

939
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:38,613
for me. And there's a- a- a
woman I met there who is

940
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:40,877
amazing.

941
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:45,079
Her name is Nicole Keller, and
she has had this really, really

942
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:47,028
cool career path. But one of the
things she was doing down in New

943
00:34:47,028 --> 00:34:50,658
York was running coding classes
for kids. And the thing that I--

944
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,893
I brought to visit-- Pam and I
had gone to New York and, you

945
00:34:52,893 --> 00:34:54,497
know, called up

946
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:55,458
Nicole. And then like, "Hey."
And she just like, "Oh, yeah.

947
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:56,388
I'm working.

948
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,393
I'm doing this coding class for
kids." And I'm like, "Can we

949
00:34:57,393 --> 00:34:58,397
come see?

950
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:00,264
That sounds awesome." And we
went in, and it was, like, the

951
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,639
attic of this

952
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:04,186
church. Like, you know, in- in,
like, mainland New York. And

953
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,733
we-- so I'm

954
00:35:06,793 --> 00:35:09,223
just going to say mainland New
York. New York island. What is--

955
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:10,112
what are you guys call it
[laughs]? What ... Manhattan!

956
00:35:10,112 --> 00:35:11,000
That's it!

957
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Dan: Manhattan. Yes [Dan and
Bekah laugh].

958
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,082
Matt: Yeah. Manhattan. And we
[laughs]-- and it was-- but,

959
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:18,164
like, the thing I

960
00:35:18,164 --> 00:35:19,619
loved, Bekah, was that they
started the kids who were--

961
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,074
like,

962
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:22,018
they were just building static
sites, and they use like a

963
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:22,933
website builder.

964
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:25,603
They were, like, as young as,
like, eight, nine years old,

965
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:28,043
but they started them with--
they had gone to the UN's ...

966
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,152
and

967
00:35:30,153 --> 00:35:32,074
I forget what it's called, but,
like, basically these are, like,

968
00:35:32,074 --> 00:35:33,604
our principles, and they had
asked the kids like, "What's

969
00:35:33,604 --> 00:35:35,134
one thing

970
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:37,324
that you'd wanna affect change
with, and let's build a website

971
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:39,094
to do that." Like, they- they
started-- they didn't start

972
00:35:39,094 --> 00:35:40,864
with

973
00:35:40,923 --> 00:35:44,014
teaching JavaScript or teaching
HTML, and CSS. They started

974
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:45,000
with, like, what's the change
you wanna see in the world?

975
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

976
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,366
Matt: And how can we use these
amazing tools to do this? And I

977
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:50,732
think that for people

978
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,793
who are getting into tech, you
know? It's-- and there's a lot

979
00:35:52,793 --> 00:35:54,853
of

980
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,278
people that are coming in for
many, many reasons into tech.

981
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:57,703
And

982
00:35:57,704 --> 00:35:59,083
especially now. It's, like-- I
think people are realizing that

983
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,462
you can

984
00:36:00,463 --> 00:36:02,353
have this great lifestyle with
it, which is wonderful. And

985
00:36:02,353 --> 00:36:03,628
that's a great reason to come
into tech. There- there's these

986
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:04,903
other

987
00:36:04,903 --> 00:36:07,844
things that are connected to it.
I- I think one thing I'd love to

988
00:36:07,844 --> 00:36:10,618
introduce to that, sort of, you
know, thought processes that

989
00:36:10,618 --> 00:36:13,392
this is a tremendously

990
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:15,685
powerful thing. You can make
computers do stuff

991
00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:17,977
automatically, and that's

992
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:20,168
awesome. And it can really
affect positive change on the

993
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:21,938
world. And

994
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:23,423
so, you know, as you're figuring
out what your learning projects

995
00:36:23,423 --> 00:36:25,253
are, think about what you--
like, what you wanna change

996
00:36:25,253 --> 00:36:27,083
about the

997
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,357
world. Like,

998
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:30,038
you- you know-- can you make
something for your-- f- your

999
00:36:30,038 --> 00:36:31,718
friend group? Can

1000
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,608
you make something for yourself?
Can you automate something that

1001
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,123
you're doing regularly? Can you
make something that would be

1002
00:36:35,123 --> 00:36:36,638
just

1003
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:38,484
really funny or cool, you know?
Like- like, what do you wanna

1004
00:36:38,484 --> 00:36:40,329
make?

1005
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:43,748
And- and I think, if you start
with that, like, that can be

1006
00:36:43,748 --> 00:36:45,976
really powerful. Because, you-
you know, if- if you're

1007
00:36:45,976 --> 00:36:48,204
self-taught, one of

1008
00:36:48,204 --> 00:36:49,853
the biggest challenges you're
gonna face—and one of the

1009
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:51,953
biggest challenges I faced—is
how do you do it regularly?

1010
00:36:51,953 --> 00:36:54,053
There

1011
00:36:54,054 --> 00:36:56,199
would be weeks I, you know,
couldn't bring myself to have

1012
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:58,344
the energy to code at,

1013
00:36:58,344 --> 00:37:00,773
like, 9 o'clock at night, right?
And- and to continue that

1014
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:03,983
learning- learning is so hard.
And it's such an emotionally

1015
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:08,003
challenging journey too. But if
you're connected to something

1016
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:09,548
that you just wanna see out
there, that- that's a deeper

1017
00:37:09,548 --> 00:37:11,093
level

1018
00:37:11,094 --> 00:37:14,724
of motivation than, you know,
than somebody on one side [??]

1019
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:17,304
can be out there. I think that's
powerful.

1020
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Bekah: Yeah.

1021
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,968
Dan: Yeah. I- I- I love that a-
a lot. And, you know, and this

1022
00:37:20,968 --> 00:37:23,817
is-- we actually-- we

1023
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:26,789
just released Roger's episode.
We talked to him a couple of

1024
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:31,357
weeks ago, and- and he- he said
a lot of the same things. He- he

1025
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:33,128
has sort of a-- I mean, not the
exact path, but, like,

1026
00:37:33,128 --> 00:37:34,898
self-taught

1027
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:36,399
and- and solving his own
problems—sort of thing—to

1028
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:37,869
learn

1029
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:41,559
coding. And so, I was-- I'm on
the same boat too. I think my

1030
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,139
first website ... well, that
wasn't, like, a GeoCities site,

1031
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:46,719
it was, like, my--

1032
00:37:46,949 --> 00:37:49,119
site for my band, right? It was,
like, in Flash or whatever.

1033
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:49,989
Matt: That's awesome.

1034
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:53,453
Dan: Just the-- yeah [chuckles].
I mean, it's fine.

1035
00:37:53,453 --> 00:37:56,917
But, the- the-- we--

1036
00:37:57,429 --> 00:37:58,929
nowadays, there's so many
learning, like, opportunities

1037
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:00,429
or the bootcamps,

1038
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:02,768
and everything like that. And
there's so much-- so many

1039
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:04,393
different choices to- to make,
so many different paths you can

1040
00:38:04,393 --> 00:38:06,008
take. And

1041
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,348
I-- it-- when- when I came up,
it's-- there was nothing, you

1042
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:10,178
know, nothing

1043
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:13,298
like that at all. There was some
books that were out of date as

1044
00:38:13,298 --> 00:38:14,603
soon as they hit the shelves,
and-- you know? And then the

1045
00:38:14,603 --> 00:38:15,908
internet,

1046
00:38:15,938 --> 00:38:18,173
right? And blogs, and- and
things like that. But I found

1047
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:20,408
success the

1048
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:25,043
same- the same way it was. Doing
things that, like, were either

1049
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:27,023
fun or, like, I wanted to fix,
right? And you were tell the

1050
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:29,003
story—w- when

1051
00:38:29,063 --> 00:38:32,123
you were talking about the- the
automated spreadsheet—the

1052
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:34,118
thing that, you know-- there-
there-- I was thinking in

1053
00:38:34,118 --> 00:38:36,113
my head, this-- it's

1054
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,199
like a- a curse and a blessing
of- of people who learn program-

1055
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,284
like,

1056
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,363
once you start down the path,
like, once you've figured out

1057
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:42,442
some

1058
00:38:42,443 --> 00:38:44,408
stuff is that you start seeing
this everywhere. Like, "Oh my

1059
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:46,373
god, that--

1060
00:38:46,403 --> 00:38:49,238
I could make this easier,"
[chuckles] right? And it's,

1061
00:38:49,238 --> 00:38:52,073
like-- and it's- and it's-- when
you do it,

1062
00:38:52,074 --> 00:38:53,903
it's, like, a blessing, right?
But it's, obviously-- I have

1063
00:38:53,903 --> 00:38:55,732
this-- for me,

1064
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,473
anyway, I don't-- maybe this
isn't for everybody. But it--

1065
00:38:57,473 --> 00:38:59,213
it's, like [chuckles], I start
to think about it

1066
00:38:59,244 --> 00:39:00,923
all the time, for everything.
And sometimes it gets out of

1067
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:02,602
hand,

1068
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:04,419
sometimes [laughs] I'm
automating things that don't

1069
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:06,204
actually take me that

1070
00:39:06,204 --> 00:39:09,034
long, probably. It-- probably
the work is taking longer than

1071
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:14,784
it did, but, you know, it's-
it's ... I don't know. It's such

1072
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:15,879
a-- once you get into that habit
of thinking that way, and,

1073
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:16,974
like--

1074
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:19,663
and the making things, it's-- it
can be such-- it can- it can

1075
00:39:19,663 --> 00:39:22,283
improve your life. And—like you
say—you

1076
00:39:22,284 --> 00:39:24,939
can improve- you can improve
little annoying things or

1077
00:39:24,939 --> 00:39:27,594
little things, you know, like,

1078
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:29,004
small things with your family,
or your friends, or, you know,

1079
00:39:29,004 --> 00:39:30,414
large

1080
00:39:30,443 --> 00:39:31,748
changes too. And it-- it's- it's
cool. Well, there's so many

1081
00:39:31,748 --> 00:39:33,053
apps, so

1082
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:33,864
many possibilities out there.

1083
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:36,659
Matt: I mean, are there- are
there any other projects that

1084
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:40,183
you've done, Dan, that are, you
know, particularly redundant or

1085
00:39:40,183 --> 00:39:43,707
[chuckles] maybe, like, not the

1086
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,124
most, you know, effective use of
time? Or any-- do you

1087
00:39:46,124 --> 00:39:47,009
[unintelligible]--

1088
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,133
Dan: Oh, well, I-- how many
color lights case here behind

1089
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:49,227
me? [Dan chuckles, Bekah laughs]

1090
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,478
Matt: [Laughs] Quite a few
actually.

1091
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:54,013
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Back in-
back in-- I was-- every time

1092
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:56,068
we start-- like, there was a two
months or

1093
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:57,598
something where I-- so, these
are all, like, hue light bulbs.

1094
00:39:57,598 --> 00:39:59,128
And there's-

1095
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,278
there's one you can't see too.
And I've spent so much time--

1096
00:40:01,278 --> 00:40:03,368
cuz I

1097
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:04,704
hated the lights in here. I
had-- before these, I just had,

1098
00:40:04,704 --> 00:40:06,039
like,

1099
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:10,148
lights. Like, lamps. Everywhere.
And never could get the lighting

1100
00:40:10,148 --> 00:40:11,798
right. And then, I got these,
you know-- so, I have-- now I

1101
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:13,448
got these

1102
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:15,849
hue, I'm like, "This is the
perfect solution. Hue bulbs. Cuz

1103
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:17,739
you can connect, you know, you
can connect them with your phone

1104
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:21,849
or your, you know, there's
probably a- a web, or a Mac app,

1105
00:40:21,909 --> 00:40:23,709
and all that stuff." A-a-and so
I replaced all of [chuckles] the

1106
00:40:23,709 --> 00:40:25,509
bulbs with these

1107
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:27,024
things. And now- now there's too
many op- like, now, it's, like--

1108
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,539
[Dan and Bekah chuckle]

1109
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:29,948
there's too much to do. Like, I
can-- I have too many options.

1110
00:40:29,948 --> 00:40:31,297
There's too many

1111
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:33,083
colors, too many, like, ways. I
can turn them up and down. And

1112
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:34,868
also,

1113
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:37,006
I-- and I kinda-- exactly how I
wanted it. But then, it was,

1114
00:40:37,006 --> 00:40:38,994
like-- okay. Well,

1115
00:40:38,994 --> 00:40:39,916
it's still a pain for me to,
like, open my phone, and, like,

1116
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:42,684
to push the

1117
00:40:42,684 --> 00:40:44,678
button, you know [chuckles]? So
it's, like, time to these--

1118
00:40:44,678 --> 00:40:46,672
like, time for automations. I

1119
00:40:46,673 --> 00:40:48,428
finally bought-- oh, you can't
see it, but I bought-- so, hue

1120
00:40:48,428 --> 00:40:50,183
has

1121
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:52,073
this, like, a button that you--
it is just, like, a little- a

1122
00:40:52,073 --> 00:40:53,962
little

1123
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:56,393
click button. And you can put it
on the wall, or you can put it

1124
00:40:56,393 --> 00:40:59,273
wherever, and you can set that
to do whatever you want when

1125
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:00,000
you click it different ways
[laughs].

1126
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Matt: Cool.

1127
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,832
Dan: So, I have that on my wall
now. So, I-- yeah. I- I spent,

1128
00:41:04,832 --> 00:41:08,664
like, five days of- of being
happy. I'm- I'm like,

1129
00:41:08,664 --> 00:41:09,998
"Huh? This is- this is it. I
have it." And, like, just this

1130
00:41:09,998 --> 00:41:11,332
morning, I

1131
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:13,338
sat down, and I'm like, "I
should change the colors of

1132
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:15,343
these lights- these lights [all
laughs] right now, but--"

1133
00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:22,103
So it was-- I sometimes struggle
with being satisfied

1134
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:24,068
with- with things. But I still--
it is-- it's also fun

1135
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:26,213
though, you know? [All laughs]

1136
00:41:28,364 --> 00:41:30,659
Matt: Man, it-- the-- Bekah,
you-- like, you have a-- and,

1137
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:32,954
you know, Virtual Coffee, I
think

1138
00:41:32,954 --> 00:41:35,864
it would be totally fair to call
that, like, a-- like, an amazing

1139
00:41:35,864 --> 00:41:37,844
project that both of you have
created. It's the community I

1140
00:41:37,844 --> 00:41:40,048
love and love being part of. And
so, like, does that-- is it

1141
00:41:40,048 --> 00:41:43,503
sort of-- the same sort of thing
that has happened with you,

1142
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:44,753
Bekah,

1143
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:45,948
where you've had these things
that you've taken on, and you've

1144
00:41:45,948 --> 00:41:47,143
made, and

1145
00:41:47,954 --> 00:41:50,324
resulted in these learning
experiences? And I'd imagine

1146
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:51,373
Virtual Coffee has been an
amazing learning experience.

1147
00:41:51,373 --> 00:41:52,422
Even for yourself [??].

1148
00:41:52,628 --> 00:41:54,443
Bekah: Oh, for sure. It's been a
learning experience, and it's

1149
00:41:54,443 --> 00:41:56,258
been

1150
00:41:56,259 --> 00:42:00,489
great. I feel like I'm always
dropping things. We have the

1151
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:03,054
maintainers channel. And so,
you-- there- there will be

1152
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:05,619
times where

1153
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:09,009
I just, like, drop a bunch of
different ideas. Like, these are

1154
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:10,598
all things that I think we
should be doing. And a lot of

1155
00:42:10,598 --> 00:42:12,187
times,

1156
00:42:12,188 --> 00:42:14,723
like, I'm writing out all of the
processes, or what this means,

1157
00:42:14,723 --> 00:42:17,258
or what

1158
00:42:17,259 --> 00:42:20,829
support we need. And then,
obviously, we don't do all of

1159
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:23,109
those because there's only 24
hours in a day [laughs], and

1160
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:25,389
it's just not

1161
00:42:25,389 --> 00:42:27,113
possible. But-- and that was,
like, I- I got four hours of

1162
00:42:27,113 --> 00:42:28,837
sleep last

1163
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,848
night. And it was because last
night before bed, I- I was

1164
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,858
having this

1165
00:42:32,858 --> 00:42:35,243
idea about a tech summit that I
wanted to be doing. And I was,

1166
00:42:35,243 --> 00:42:37,628
like,

1167
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:41,917
messaging Kirk and Nick Taylor
about that. Like, "Hey, is this

1168
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:43,748
a-- is this a idea that's too
out there? Or is this something

1169
00:42:43,748 --> 00:42:45,578
that

1170
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:48,461
maybe is useful, or good, or
worth, like, talking about?" And

1171
00:42:48,461 --> 00:42:51,343
then, I fell

1172
00:42:51,344 --> 00:42:53,008
asleep. And then, it was, like,
three in the morning, I woke up,

1173
00:42:53,008 --> 00:42:54,672
and my

1174
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:55,828
brain was like, "All right.
Yeah. Let's- let's figure this

1175
00:42:55,828 --> 00:42:56,983
out

1176
00:42:56,983 --> 00:43:00,568
right now [laughs]." Like, "No."
But I feel like, you know, it's

1177
00:43:00,568 --> 00:43:04,153
a lot of

1178
00:43:04,153 --> 00:43:06,148
that, but learning has been
really great. And now I feel

1179
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:08,143
like

1180
00:43:08,143 --> 00:43:09,973
I'm going down this-- I- I don't
like Notion. I have not

1181
00:43:09,973 --> 00:43:11,803
liked it

1182
00:43:11,804 --> 00:43:14,241
anytime I've used it, but, like,
my methods of storing all of

1183
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:16,678
these

1184
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:21,628
ideas and writing about them is
just unsatisfactory now. And so,

1185
00:43:21,628 --> 00:43:23,488
I've started going down the
Notion rabbit hole of like,

1186
00:43:23,488 --> 00:43:25,348
"This

1187
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:28,349
is- this is what I need to do.
And I need to automate these

1188
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:30,899
things to my Notion because I
know that I can." So, I feel

1189
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:33,449
like you

1190
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:35,863
could probably automate, like,
hi- what your lights look like

1191
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,277
through Notion,

1192
00:43:38,518 --> 00:43:41,818
right? If you just select what
mood you're in, and then it will

1193
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:43,406
automatically set your lights.
So, Dan, you should try that

1194
00:43:43,406 --> 00:43:44,994
[chuckles].

1195
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:46,839
Dan: Yeah. Last time I messed
with Notion, I had, like, a

1196
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:47,829
nervous

1197
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:49,208
breakdown trying to get
everything exactly like

1198
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:50,587
[chuckles]--

1199
00:43:51,224 --> 00:43:52,603
Bekah: Kirk is making me a
template. So [chuckles]--

1200
00:43:53,753 --> 00:43:55,583
Dan: Yeah. That's the- that's
the issue I have with Notion is-

1201
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,413
is-- it's

1202
00:43:57,414 --> 00:43:59,664
a great product and it's a very,
very cool initiative. There's

1203
00:43:59,664 --> 00:44:01,043
just too many possibilities, and
it's too pop- it's, like,

1204
00:44:01,043 --> 00:44:02,422
possible

1205
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:04,838
to get it-- it seems possible to
get it perfect [chuckles].

1206
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:07,253
And it's, like--

1207
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:09,143
when that- when that, like,
perfect thing gets in my head,

1208
00:44:09,143 --> 00:44:12,233
it's hard to-- sometimes hard to
let it go. So [chuckles]--

1209
00:44:13,409 --> 00:44:14,849
Matt: Yeah. We- we've spent a
lot of time in Notion too. We--

1210
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:16,289
you

1211
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:19,227
know, it's ... things that are
highly customizable are often

1212
00:44:19,228 --> 00:44:20,369
not the best tools, right? Like,
it's--

1213
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:23,668
you know, I appreciate software
that has opinion sometimes.

1214
00:44:23,668 --> 00:44:25,000
Bekah: I say that--

1215
00:44:23,668 --> 00:44:25,000
Dan: Yeah. My- my-- oh, go
ahead, Bekah.

1216
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:29,588
Bekah: It-- my-- right now, I've
just collected way too many

1217
00:44:29,588 --> 00:44:33,969
different ways of doing things.
Like, you know, I've got all

1218
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:36,383
these apps to help me with
planning or note taking or,

1219
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:38,797
you

1220
00:44:38,798 --> 00:44:40,628
know, whatev- there's just way
too many of them. So, I feel

1221
00:44:40,628 --> 00:44:42,458
like I'm

1222
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:45,848
just very ... all or nothing
kind of person. And so

1223
00:44:45,848 --> 00:44:49,238
[chuckles] I- I can't have all
of

1224
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:52,653
these. Now, I just need one
thing, and Notion is the- the

1225
00:44:52,653 --> 00:44:56,067
one thing to rule them all up,

1226
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:56,619
apparently.

1227
00:44:58,353 --> 00:44:59,778
Matt: [Chuckles] And so then,
you know, in-- circling back,

1228
00:44:59,778 --> 00:45:01,203
like, Bekah, you

1229
00:45:01,204 --> 00:45:03,363
have this awesome job. You're an
amazing community manager. Did

1230
00:45:03,363 --> 00:45:05,522
you have

1231
00:45:05,523 --> 00:45:06,963
those skills before you started
the Virtual Coffee or was that

1232
00:45:06,963 --> 00:45:08,403
something that you

1233
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,364
learned and kind of just figured
out, go into the process?

1234
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:15,113
Bekah: When I- when I was in
undergrad, I- I graduated in

1235
00:45:15,113 --> 00:45:17,033
three

1236
00:45:17,034 --> 00:45:19,764
years. So I took a bunch of
credits, but I was also in 10

1237
00:45:19,764 --> 00:45:22,328
clubs, and I was an officer in,
like, five of them [chuckles].

1238
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:24,892
So, I- I feel like

1239
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:29,664
it's been a lifelong journey of
community building, and many

1240
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:32,353
points where I've tried to
reject that. Like, "Please let

1241
00:45:32,353 --> 00:45:35,042
me just be in

1242
00:45:35,043 --> 00:45:38,853
a hole by myself [chuckles] and
not talk to people." But I keep

1243
00:45:38,853 --> 00:45:40,233
coming back to it. I feel like I
finally hit the point where I'm

1244
00:45:40,233 --> 00:45:41,613
like, "Okay,"

1245
00:45:42,454 --> 00:45:45,153
like, "this- this is a skill set
I should utilize it and- and

1246
00:45:45,153 --> 00:45:47,852
figure out

1247
00:45:47,853 --> 00:45:51,603
how I can best do that thing."
So, yeah. It's- it's ... I guess

1248
00:45:51,603 --> 00:45:55,744
part of me.

1249
00:45:57,074 --> 00:45:58,653
Matt: That's really cool. I--
you know, I think that, like,

1250
00:45:58,653 --> 00:46:00,232
one of the

1251
00:46:00,233 --> 00:46:05,143
things that, you know-- I was
hard to figure out, and I'm- I'm

1252
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:07,373
hope-- I think it's okay. I'm
kind of like left turning the

1253
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:08,303
conversation a little bit. One
of the things that was really

1254
00:46:08,303 --> 00:46:09,233
hard

1255
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,423
to figure out in- in running a
business is, like, how do you

1256
00:46:11,423 --> 00:46:14,873
hire? And you need to figure it
all out from scratch. Because,

1257
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:16,238
like, we had hired a bunch of
people that make stuff at IBM,

1258
00:46:16,238 --> 00:46:17,603
but

1259
00:46:17,603 --> 00:46:19,554
it was all a very catered
experience. Like, we had-- we

1260
00:46:19,554 --> 00:46:22,028
outsourced all of the hard out
of front work [??]. And we got

1261
00:46:22,028 --> 00:46:24,502
these, like, just, like, 50

1262
00:46:24,503 --> 00:46:25,763
incredible candidates, and we
would divide them up on our

1263
00:46:25,763 --> 00:46:27,023
team,

1264
00:46:27,023 --> 00:46:27,998
and figure out who's gonna do
round one, round two, round

1265
00:46:27,998 --> 00:46:28,973
three,

1266
00:46:29,063 --> 00:46:32,873
right? And that-- like,
interviewing is easy, but hiring

1267
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,273
is hard. And hiring is all that
other stuff. It's like finding

1268
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:37,793
people and evaluating them. And-
and then, you know, you read

1269
00:46:37,793 --> 00:46:38,828
about all the bad things that
happen to hiring process, and

1270
00:46:38,828 --> 00:46:39,863
you

1271
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:41,514
don't wanna do those, and you
wanna do the good things, and

1272
00:46:41,514 --> 00:46:43,284
you wanna get the right person,
and then the right people. The

1273
00:46:43,284 --> 00:46:45,054
thing

1274
00:46:45,054 --> 00:46:46,683
that has always stand out to me
is personal projects. And it's-

1275
00:46:46,683 --> 00:46:48,312
it's

1276
00:46:48,414 --> 00:46:49,613
probably not surprising given
the history I just described,

1277
00:46:49,613 --> 00:46:50,812
right?

1278
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:52,358
Like, I-- like, I value them a
lot. But I think that when

1279
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:53,872
somebody

1280
00:46:53,873 --> 00:46:55,628
comes in, and they say, "Hey, I
made this thing, and here is why

1281
00:46:55,628 --> 00:46:57,383
I made it,

1282
00:46:57,384 --> 00:46:59,169
and here's-- like, how it's
important for, like, small

1283
00:46:59,169 --> 00:47:00,954
businesses,

1284
00:47:00,954 --> 00:47:03,691
especially," that is so helpful
because it's, like, the person's

1285
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:06,428
thinking

1286
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:08,288
about a need on the other side
of what they're doing. And,

1287
00:47:08,288 --> 00:47:10,147
like, you

1288
00:47:10,148 --> 00:47:12,068
know-- it- it's-- we don't have,
like, tickets where we're

1289
00:47:12,068 --> 00:47:13,988
working through.

1290
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:17,079
We're too small. We, you know--
we don't have a ton of process

1291
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:18,893
around things. But, like, when
people come in, and then I

1292
00:47:18,893 --> 00:47:20,707
imagine this is the

1293
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:22,598
case for you, Bekah, and you do
this amazing community

1294
00:47:22,598 --> 00:47:24,488
management, and

1295
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:26,364
all this other stuff. And you
have Virtual Coffee as this

1296
00:47:26,364 --> 00:47:28,239
incredible example

1297
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:31,006
of you doing that, in tech, at
scale. And- and I just-- that's

1298
00:47:31,006 --> 00:47:33,773
awesome.

1299
00:47:34,324 --> 00:47:36,753
Bekah: Yeah. I-- and that's what
led to the job that I have

1300
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:41,193
right now. I wasn't looking for
work. My team lead reached

1301
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:43,143
out to me and it was based on
Virtual Coffee. And somebody

1302
00:47:43,143 --> 00:47:45,093
else

1303
00:47:45,094 --> 00:47:48,543
had—who I'd interviewed with,
who had reached out to me

1304
00:47:48,903 --> 00:47:51,118
last summer ... because they
knew about Virtual

1305
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,333
Coffee—recommended

1306
00:47:53,364 --> 00:47:55,689
me. Like, I was on the top of
the-- their list.

1307
00:47:55,689 --> 00:47:58,014
And so, once he

1308
00:47:58,014 --> 00:48:01,494
started looking into Virtual
Coffee—I think he watched

1309
00:48:01,523 --> 00:48:04,643
some of our Lunch and Learn
videos and read blog posts—like,

1310
00:48:04,643 --> 00:48:10,134
there- there is a-- my community
building resume is out

1311
00:48:10,134 --> 00:48:12,804
there because of all of the
things that we do. And so--

1312
00:48:12,804 --> 00:48:15,474
yeah.

1313
00:48:15,543 --> 00:48:17,158
It is. It is like a project. I
hadn't really thought about it

1314
00:48:17,158 --> 00:48:18,773
that way,

1315
00:48:18,773 --> 00:48:23,183
but it is this- this living
resume of all of the things that

1316
00:48:23,184 --> 00:48:23,934
I've been working on.

1317
00:48:24,923 --> 00:48:26,453
Matt: Totally. And- and, Dan,
watch out. Cuz, like, Phillips

1318
00:48:26,453 --> 00:48:27,983
is gonna come

1319
00:48:27,983 --> 00:48:29,693
knocking, and gonna say, "Hey,
[Dan and Bekah laugh] I heard

1320
00:48:29,693 --> 00:48:31,403
all these things you're doing
with our light bulbs [laughs]."

1321
00:48:33,134 --> 00:48:34,123
Dan: Yeah.

1322
00:48:34,793 --> 00:48:35,423
Matt: I'm, like, the CTO.
[Unintelligible] you [laughs].

1323
00:48:35,594 --> 00:48:37,294
Dan: And they gonna come, and
say, "Hey, buy this product

1324
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:38,994
[laughs]. This

1325
00:48:38,994 --> 00:48:41,094
product will finally solve all
of your problems."

1326
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:43,613
Matt: [Chuckles] Oh my god.
Yeah. I hope all the-- our

1327
00:48:43,613 --> 00:48:44,678
conversation in this podcast

1328
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,378
has an index cuz it'll go to
these Google searches. I mean,

1329
00:48:47,378 --> 00:48:49,539
this is gonna be all Philips hue
light bulbs.

1330
00:48:49,539 --> 00:48:50,543
Dan: [Laughs] Right.

1331
00:48:50,543 --> 00:48:52,574
Bekah: But we are open for
sponsorships, so--

1332
00:48:54,423 --> 00:48:54,844
Dan: Yeah. That's right.

1333
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,113
Matt: [Unintelligible] Oh my
gosh. Yeah. It's-- that's

1334
00:48:57,113 --> 00:48:58,627
really interesting. I

1335
00:48:58,628 --> 00:49:01,208
think the-- those personal
projects, they- they really

1336
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:03,788
standout. And, you

1337
00:49:03,789 --> 00:49:06,219
know, and certainly there's
merit if you're going to a

1338
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:06,908
bootcamp, and going through
that, you-- like, you wanna

1339
00:49:06,908 --> 00:49:08,977
stay on task,

1340
00:49:08,978 --> 00:49:11,648
right? And if you're gonna get
great learning, great feedback

1341
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:12,638
by building something that it--
like the bootcamp is saying,

1342
00:49:12,638 --> 00:49:13,628
"Oh, we're

1343
00:49:13,628 --> 00:49:15,443
gonna build like a, you know,
shopping cart," that's totally

1344
00:49:15,443 --> 00:49:17,258
cool, right? But

1345
00:49:17,259 --> 00:49:19,509
those- those other pieces of
like, "Hey, I've got this skill

1346
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:21,751
sat down. I can use it to just
really do anything I want," it-

1347
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:23,993
it is just so

1348
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,153
attractive to me in a hiring
process. Like, it really

1349
00:49:26,153 --> 00:49:28,312
separates

1350
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:31,373
people out. And I'd imagine
that's been the experience for

1351
00:49:31,373 --> 00:49:33,143
both of you from what you've
described too.

1352
00:49:33,893 --> 00:49:35,528
Dan: Yeah. And- and, like, if
you are-- if your only project

1353
00:49:35,528 --> 00:49:37,163
is coming out of

1354
00:49:37,164 --> 00:49:39,188
a bootcamp or what you did in
the bootcamp, and everybody else

1355
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:41,212
is trying

1356
00:49:41,213 --> 00:49:43,344
to get a job too, you know,
everybody is going to have the

1357
00:49:43,344 --> 00:49:46,043
same set of projects, right? And
so, that's- that's another thing

1358
00:49:46,074 --> 00:49:49,284
is doing those. And maybe it's--
maybe there's not enough time

1359
00:49:49,284 --> 00:49:51,474
to do it while you're in the
bootcamp, you know? Maybe kind

1360
00:49:51,563 --> 00:49:55,853
of do it after, but the-- those
personal projects, I- I totally

1361
00:49:55,853 --> 00:50:01,433
agree with you, Matt. It- it- it
says- it says so much about ...

1362
00:50:01,434 --> 00:50:02,694
you, without even speaking
[chuckles]. And then, it also

1363
00:50:02,694 --> 00:50:04,164
gives you something to talk
about—that's easy

1364
00:50:04,164 --> 00:50:06,983
to talk about—because you did
it, and you know- and you

1365
00:50:06,983 --> 00:50:09,548
know it. So it's not a
theoretical thing or, you know,

1366
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:12,113
school assignment that

1367
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:13,688
you weren't connected with, you
know? And it-- and again, it

1368
00:50:13,688 --> 00:50:15,233
doesn't

1369
00:50:15,233 --> 00:50:17,858
have to be world changing or a
successful product or anything

1370
00:50:17,858 --> 00:50:20,483
like that,

1371
00:50:20,483 --> 00:50:23,094
right? You- you were talking
about that Chrome extension that

1372
00:50:23,094 --> 00:50:24,308
you made. That's literally just
you and your wife [chuckles],

1373
00:50:24,308 --> 00:50:25,522
right?

1374
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:26,454
Matt: Yeah.

1375
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:27,953
Dan: And that- and that's it.
Like, but it-- that's- that's-

1376
00:50:27,953 --> 00:50:29,272
that's a cool project. And I

1377
00:50:29,273 --> 00:50:30,398
would like-- like, I enjoyed
hearing about it, and I

1378
00:50:30,398 --> 00:50:31,523
would—if

1379
00:50:31,523 --> 00:50:34,344
I was hiring—I would also enjoy
hearing about it. Don't-- you

1380
00:50:34,344 --> 00:50:35,798
know, you didn't, like, sell it
to somebody or, you know, it

1381
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:37,643
doesn't have to be some-- I
don't know--

1382
00:50:38,914 --> 00:50:42,264
huge thing. It's- it's just a- a
thing that you

1383
00:50:42,264 --> 00:50:44,902
decided to do on your own, and-
and you figured out how to do

1384
00:50:44,903 --> 00:50:45,713
it. And that's- that's the cool
part for me.

1385
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:51,309
Bekah: We just wrapped up a
hackathon at Deepgram. And one

1386
00:50:51,338 --> 00:50:53,438
of our participants had, I
think, five submissions. And

1387
00:50:53,438 --> 00:50:55,538
this is a month

1388
00:50:55,539 --> 00:50:58,238
long hackathon. And the
submissions were all

1389
00:50:58,238 --> 00:51:00,937
interesting, and they

1390
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:04,659
were all beautiful. The design
was really great. I'm really

1391
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:06,474
terrible at design. And the- the
fact that all of these looked

1392
00:51:06,474 --> 00:51:08,289
really

1393
00:51:08,289 --> 00:51:12,159
wonderful were meaningful, and
interesting projects was great.

1394
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:16,268
But I interviewed that
participant for a blog post

1395
00:51:16,268 --> 00:51:19,253
highlight. And being able to
hear the stories behind it, to

1396
00:51:19,253 --> 00:51:22,238
hear how he

1397
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,304
communicated, what he did, his
approach, how he did it, I--

1398
00:51:25,304 --> 00:51:28,369
that's-- he's a

1399
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:31,969
person in the top of my book
that I would recommend for a

1400
00:51:31,998 --> 00:51:33,738
job. But I know that he's
looking, and he's going to be

1401
00:51:33,738 --> 00:51:35,478
more actively

1402
00:51:35,478 --> 00:51:38,223
looking soon. And so, when
anything comes up, I know that

1403
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:40,968
I'm going

1404
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:44,687
to reach out to that person. So,
you know, if it doesn't catch

1405
00:51:44,748 --> 00:51:46,009
the eye of somebody who's doing
the hiring,

1406
00:51:46,009 --> 00:51:47,973
it might catch the eye of
somebody who's in a position

1407
00:51:47,973 --> 00:51:49,937
where people

1408
00:51:49,938 --> 00:51:51,693
reach out to them and say, "Hey,
do you know anybody?" Like,

1409
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:53,448
"Yes, I

1410
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:55,938
do. This person would be really,
really great for this role."

1411
00:51:57,963 --> 00:51:59,328
Matt: Yeah, that's- that's
really interesting. And, you

1412
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:00,693
know, and

1413
00:52:00,693 --> 00:52:03,603
another sort of related thing
that I hear a lot of hiring

1414
00:52:03,603 --> 00:52:06,333
managers articulate, and there's
famous examples of this, too,

1415
00:52:06,753 --> 00:52:08,690
is- is, like, a really strong
indicator of success in a

1416
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:10,627
businesses or in a

1417
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:14,198
particular role is how-- has
that person achieved a success

1418
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:18,759
or excellence in a completely
different area, right? And,

1419
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,409
you know, the-- Shopify has this
famous example where their

1420
00:52:20,409 --> 00:52:21,849
CEO

1421
00:52:21,849 --> 00:52:24,429
gave an internship or a job to
someone because they are, like,

1422
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:27,000
ranked in the top 50 at
StarCraft, you know?

1423
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Dan: That's awesome.

1424
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,674
Matt: And there's, like, similar
sort of conversation in- in

1425
00:52:31,674 --> 00:52:35,348
sales, like, you know, this
other sort of area around

1426
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:38,378
people who have had a-athletic
success, you know? So there-

1427
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:40,748
there are people who are sales
managers, they were like, "Oh,

1428
00:52:40,748 --> 00:52:44,289
you were division to athlete and
track?" Like, that's a really

1429
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:48,247
strong indicator for this other
type of thing. And I- I think,

1430
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:51,158
like, you also see it in, like,
volunteers. I'm-- like the stuff

1431
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:53,559
you did when we're describing in
university, Bekah. Right?

1432
00:52:54,324 --> 00:52:57,083
It's interesting, these signals.
Because the way that we

1433
00:52:57,264 --> 00:52:59,349
typically interview is like in
front of a whiteboard

1434
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:01,434
[chuckles], and we

1435
00:53:01,434 --> 00:53:03,998
just-- we know it's- it's- it's
a hard process to take on--

1436
00:53:03,998 --> 00:53:07,733
anyways, all- all I have to say.

1437
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:10,883
Bekah: Yeah, it is- it is really
hard. And I think, even hearing

1438
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:12,727
a lot of

1439
00:53:12,728 --> 00:53:14,813
conversations around hiring
where people are trying to do

1440
00:53:14,813 --> 00:53:16,898
things,

1441
00:53:16,929 --> 00:53:20,648
there-- there's still so much of
the process where we're stuck

1442
00:53:20,648 --> 00:53:25,098
inside this box. So, rather
than, like, really trying to ...

1443
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:29,548
rethink how we

1444
00:53:29,548 --> 00:53:32,518
do the entire process, we're,
like, well, we're gonna

1445
00:53:32,518 --> 00:53:36,748
rethink but we still have to do
all of these things. And we have

1446
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:39,148
to ask these questions because
you have to. [Chuckles] You- you

1447
00:53:39,148 --> 00:53:41,548
don't have to.

1448
00:53:41,548 --> 00:53:43,633
That's not-- what is that ...
indicating? And how does that

1449
00:53:43,633 --> 00:53:45,718
tell you

1450
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:48,898
whether or not that's going to
be a good person for you to work

1451
00:53:48,898 --> 00:53:53,428
with or a good team for you to
join? How do we rethink the way

1452
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:57,216
that we're ... doing hiring? How
we're onboarding new people? How

1453
00:53:57,216 --> 00:54:01,003
we are

1454
00:54:01,003 --> 00:54:03,238
looking at junior developers in
this hiring process? I can't--

1455
00:54:03,238 --> 00:54:05,473
in- in

1456
00:54:05,474 --> 00:54:09,014
my mind, it has to be-- there's
a much bigger shift that needs

1457
00:54:09,014 --> 00:54:12,643
to happen than, you know, these
tiny changes that we keep seeing

1458
00:54:12,643 --> 00:54:13,244
happening.

1459
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:18,369
Matt: Yeah. I, you know, I--
there's a part of me that--

1460
00:54:18,608 --> 00:54:21,518
and I- I wanna sort of say this
in the, like, the best possible

1461
00:54:21,518 --> 00:54:24,158
way that I'm-- I- I wish that
people generally were more

1462
00:54:24,158 --> 00:54:26,798
deliberate

1463
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:28,763
about what they wanted out of a
job. And this has been something

1464
00:54:28,763 --> 00:54:30,668
that's been

1465
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:32,333
incredibly important for me.
And, you know, there's these

1466
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:33,998
books

1467
00:54:33,998 --> 00:54:36,458
that, like, sort of get you
thinking on these topics, but,

1468
00:54:37,224 --> 00:54:39,143
like, really early on, for me,
was it-- that- that juncture

1469
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:41,062
where I'm like,

1470
00:54:41,063 --> 00:54:42,713
"Oh," like, "a career in tech,
in- in ..." specifically,

1471
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:44,363
there's a shift I

1472
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,923
had, you know, a couple of years
after learning code where I--

1473
00:54:45,923 --> 00:54:47,482
I've

1474
00:54:47,543 --> 00:54:50,634
very deliberately, I wanna run a
business. I- I wanna run a

1475
00:54:50,634 --> 00:54:53,123
technology based business. And
that wasn't for the sake of

1476
00:54:53,184 --> 00:54:55,523
wanting to do that. It was
because of these other things

1477
00:54:55,523 --> 00:54:56,783
that I wanted. I sat-- literally
had a moment where I

1478
00:54:56,783 --> 00:54:58,043
sat down, and I

1479
00:54:58,043 --> 00:55:02,553
say, "What do I wanted in my
work life?" And, you know, for

1480
00:55:02,554 --> 00:55:03,649
me, they were things that were
connected to autonomy. I

1481
00:55:03,649 --> 00:55:04,744
wanted—like,

1482
00:55:04,983 --> 00:55:08,133
in a perfect world—I would work
where and when I wanted to.

1483
00:55:08,134 --> 00:55:09,709
I would-- like, I- I ne- was
always confused that we had

1484
00:55:09,709 --> 00:55:11,284
this, like, 40

1485
00:55:11,284 --> 00:55:13,034
hour a week box that we often
live in. Like, why does that-

1486
00:55:13,034 --> 00:55:14,784
why does

1487
00:55:14,784 --> 00:55:17,844
that have to exist, you know?
Like, what are the reasons that

1488
00:55:17,844 --> 00:55:19,959
the edges of that box are there?
And, like, I-- what if one week

1489
00:55:19,959 --> 00:55:22,074
I

1490
00:55:22,074 --> 00:55:25,403
wanna work less and one week I
wanted that type of control to--

1491
00:55:25,884 --> 00:55:29,483
you know, there were these-- I-
I wanted to work on any type of

1492
00:55:29,483 --> 00:55:32,693
problem that I wanted. I- I
wanted to have the potential for

1493
00:55:32,693 --> 00:55:36,293
financial independence, you
know? These types of things. And

1494
00:55:36,344 --> 00:55:38,373
that put, like-- you know, to
me, that was really helpful

1495
00:55:38,373 --> 00:55:40,402
because

1496
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:41,873
it determined the types of jobs
that I wanted to work at and-

1497
00:55:41,873 --> 00:55:43,343
and why.

1498
00:55:43,824 --> 00:55:45,233
And so, when I started applying
to-- and I-- like, I think I

1499
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:46,642
applied

1500
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:48,713
to, you know, putting IBM and
Microsoft aside because I- I

1501
00:55:48,713 --> 00:55:50,783
never actually put an

1502
00:55:50,784 --> 00:55:53,754
application into either company.
It-- they-- like, once you get

1503
00:55:53,754 --> 00:55:56,724
in, it-- I

1504
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:59,813
just wanna go there, but it's a
different process. And-- but

1505
00:55:59,813 --> 00:56:00,983
I did apply to two technology
companies to be a programmer.

1506
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,153
And

1507
00:56:02,244 --> 00:56:04,994
that-- my purpose in applying to
them was, you know, the- the

1508
00:56:05,003 --> 00:56:07,434
conventional wisdom that working
at a startup will help you do a

1509
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:10,434
startup later. And that's what I
wanted. I wanted to run my own

1510
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:11,573
business. So, I was applying to
a very particular type of

1511
00:56:11,573 --> 00:56:12,712
company

1512
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:16,344
because the purpose of that
learning was to help me do this

1513
00:56:16,344 --> 00:56:20,273
thing later. And, you know, the
funny thing about people who are

1514
00:56:20,304 --> 00:56:23,873
junior devel- developers and who
are graduating, like, in 2022

1515
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:25,223
is in a very short period of
time, they're the hiring

1516
00:56:25,223 --> 00:56:26,153
managers.

1517
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:30,498
And, you know, I-- like, I-- my
gut feeling is that if people

1518
00:56:30,498 --> 00:56:32,687
were

1519
00:56:32,688 --> 00:56:36,679
approaching that process with,
like, a very deliberate set of

1520
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:40,489
values and intentions, that
hiring would change on the

1521
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:44,748
back end later, or maybe not,
you know? [Laughs]

1522
00:56:48,969 --> 00:56:50,708
Bekah: Yeah, that's interesting.
I hadn't really thought about

1523
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:53,333
that. And it- and it can be
really hard, especially with so

1524
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:55,958
many people

1525
00:56:55,989 --> 00:56:58,268
looking for jobs on the market
right now. And-- I knew that I

1526
00:56:58,268 --> 00:57:00,547
spent a lot

1527
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:05,079
of time telling people, when you
join your first team, it should

1528
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:09,849
be about the people and not the
project. Because I've seen so

1529
00:57:09,849 --> 00:57:14,139
many people jump into-- I--
particularly, EdTech companies.

1530
00:57:11,994 --> 00:57:14,139
I don't know.

1531
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:17,033
I just-- generally, EdTech
that's really toxic or what, but

1532
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:19,777
just

1533
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:22,718
really bad experiences. And
there's been the whole, like,

1534
00:57:22,718 --> 00:57:25,027
mission trade-off thing.

1535
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:27,991
"Well," you know, "We've got a
great mission." Well, but you're

1536
00:57:27,991 --> 00:57:30,923
doing a

1537
00:57:30,923 --> 00:57:32,963
terrible job of managing a team,
being kind to other people

1538
00:57:32,963 --> 00:57:35,003
[chuckles], you

1539
00:57:35,003 --> 00:57:37,253
know? Like, those things matter.

1540
00:57:38,403 --> 00:57:40,548
Matt: Yeah. You know, I- I-- if
I was, you know, the key-- talk

1541
00:57:40,548 --> 00:57:42,693
about EdTech—and I

1542
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:45,093
completely echo that sentiment—I
think it's totally correct.

1543
00:57:45,153 --> 00:57:46,000
And video- video game industry
is notorious, right?

1544
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Bekah: Yeah.

1545
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,988
Matt: For-- like, it's not being
a great place to work. If

1546
00:57:49,989 --> 00:57:53,978
there was one thing that I
learned working in big tech,

1547
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:55,884
like, you know, going from a
college where you're-- you know,

1548
00:57:55,884 --> 00:57:57,759
you--

1549
00:57:57,789 --> 00:58:00,398
like, you make this amount of
money, you need a $1,500 raise a

1550
00:58:00,398 --> 00:58:02,378
year, and it's unionized, and X,
and Y, and Z. And then, like, I

1551
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,358
remember

1552
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:06,734
the week that I joined IBM,
they, like, flew me down to

1553
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:09,079
Silicon Valley for two

1554
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:10,714
weeks. We had this-- then we
had, like, this event. And there

1555
00:58:10,714 --> 00:58:12,349
was, like,

1556
00:58:12,498 --> 00:58:15,528
this music, and it was just all
catered, and it was all free,

1557
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:18,004
and it was crazy—the amount of
money. And I got the opportunity

1558
00:58:18,004 --> 00:58:19,969
to work

1559
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:22,668
with you. It was really great. I
loved both of those jobs.

1560
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:24,543
Loved, loved, loved both of
them. And I think, one of the

1561
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:26,297
things

1562
00:58:26,298 --> 00:58:29,329
that I've learned is, that a lot
of the things that we want in an

1563
00:58:29,329 --> 00:58:31,386
employer, a really, really
strong indicator is the health

1564
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:33,443
of the

1565
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:37,344
business. If you wanna- if- if
you wanna work, you know, my- my

1566
00:58:37,403 --> 00:58:39,833
wife works at Shopify. She loves
it there. And, you know, they

1567
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:42,263
have-- Shopify makes

1568
00:58:42,264 --> 00:58:43,943
so much money that they can hire
people, that all they do is

1569
00:58:43,943 --> 00:58:45,622
think

1570
00:58:45,623 --> 00:58:48,204
about diversity and equity. And
they hire another-- they have a

1571
00:58:48,204 --> 00:58:49,613
whole team that all they do is
think about culture. And they

1572
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:51,022
have

1573
00:58:51,023 --> 00:58:54,534
whole teams that do all-- do
nothing but, you know, run an

1574
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:58,509
internal events and try to make
that a great place to work, you

1575
00:58:58,509 --> 00:59:01,000
know? You can do that if you've
got a ton of money.

1576
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

1577
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,934
Matt: And, you know, in terms of
diversity in tech, my AI team at

1578
00:59:04,934 --> 00:59:07,868
Microsoft, we were

1579
00:59:08,018 --> 00:59:10,329
extremely diverse by every
standard. We had more women than

1580
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:12,788
men, and- and that's an AI
where-- like, its AI and data

1581
00:59:12,788 --> 00:59:15,247
science is enormously

1582
00:59:15,248 --> 00:59:17,378
behind computer science. It's
where computer science was,

1583
00:59:17,378 --> 00:59:19,943
like, 15 years ago. But we were
able to have a diverse team at

1584
00:59:19,943 --> 00:59:22,508
Microsoft

1585
00:59:22,509 --> 00:59:25,193
because we could outbid
everybody, you know? We- we

1586
00:59:25,193 --> 00:59:27,877
could go hire the best, and the

1587
00:59:27,878 --> 00:59:30,098
best one are to work for us. And
we can afford it. And there's a

1588
00:59:30,098 --> 00:59:32,318
million

1589
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,493
other examples like that. So,
it's, like, I think, going full

1590
00:59:34,493 --> 00:59:36,668
circle,

1591
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:39,699
a lot of EdTech can be a really
tough place to work because

1592
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,000
that's a really, really hard
business to be in.

1593
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

1594
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,959
Matt: And you're- you're
pinching every corner. And

1595
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:47,918
usually, you are. And same with
the video game

1596
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:51,338
industry is-- it is, like, you
know, if that game does well,

1597
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:53,348
congratulations. But if it
doesn't, you-- it-- like, it's

1598
00:59:53,348 --> 00:59:55,358
really-- it's a tough

1599
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:59,043
environment to work in. So, you
know, if you wanna have a

1600
00:59:59,043 --> 01:00:01,503
really great place to work, I
think the best, most simple

1601
01:00:01,503 --> 01:00:02,913
indicator you can look at is,
like, how much money did they

1602
01:00:02,913 --> 01:00:04,323
raise in

1603
01:00:04,324 --> 01:00:05,794
the last round—if it's a
startup. If it's a publicly--

1604
01:00:05,794 --> 01:00:07,264
big

1605
01:00:07,264 --> 01:00:09,454
publicly traded company, is it
growing? Look at their stock

1606
01:00:09,454 --> 01:00:11,119
chart for five years. Does it go
up? You know, if it does,

1607
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,784
probably

1608
01:00:12,784 --> 01:00:14,478
a great place to work. If it's
flat, it- it, you know, you

1609
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:16,172
might be getting,

1610
01:00:16,684 --> 01:00:17,793
like-- you might not have budget
to go to that next

1611
01:00:17,793 --> 01:00:18,902
conference.

1612
01:00:18,963 --> 01:00:20,718
It's ... you know? And
similarly, people might not be

1613
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:23,164
attracted to work there, in the
same.

1614
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,201
Bekah: Yeah, I think that's
great advice. I wanna thank you

1615
01:00:27,201 --> 01:00:29,601
so much for being here with us
today and having this

1616
01:00:29,601 --> 01:00:31,595
conversation. There's a lot of
really great takeaway cuz I feel

1617
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:33,589
like--

1618
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:36,860
from all these stuff that we
talked about here, is there

1619
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:40,670
anything that you wanna share
before we leave or any last

1620
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,050
words of wisdom for our
listeners?

1621
01:00:42,596 --> 01:00:44,036
Matt: No. Thanks everyone. The--
thank you, Bekah and Dan, for

1622
01:00:44,036 --> 01:00:45,476
having me.

1623
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:46,855
It's- it's great. If nothing
else, I think one of the things

1624
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:48,234
we all

1625
01:00:48,235 --> 01:00:49,810
take away from today is build
personal projects. Go make

1626
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:51,385
stuff.

1627
01:00:51,536 --> 01:00:54,924
Like, you know, the- the old
Y-Com motto, make- make stuff

1628
01:00:54,925 --> 01:00:56,396
people want, right? Make stuff
you want.

1629
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Bekah: Yeah.

1630
01:00:56,501 --> 01:00:56,800
Dan: Yeah.

1631
01:00:56,846 --> 01:00:57,326
Matt: It's cool. And share it--

1632
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:58,501
Bekah: Share with us too. We
wanna see 'em.

1633
01:00:59,036 --> 01:01:00,896
Matt: Yeah, totally. Thank you
so much for having me.

1634
01:01:01,001 --> 01:01:03,000
Dan: Thanks, Matt. This is
awesome.

1635
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Bekah: Bye.

1636
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,834
Dan: Thank you for listening to
this episode of the Virtual

1637
01:01:08,834 --> 01:01:11,668
