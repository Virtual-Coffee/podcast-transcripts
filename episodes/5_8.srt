Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 5, Episode 8

2
00:00:07,615 --> 00:00:09,535
of

3
00:00:09,535 --> 00:00:12,173
the Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

4
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:14,811
that

5
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:18,711
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

6
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:20,136
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

7
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:21,561
their

8
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:24,231
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

9
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:25,446
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

10
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:26,661
it with

11
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:29,262
you. Here with me today is my
co-host, Dan.

12
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:31,000
Dan Ott: Hello, Bekah.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Bekah: Hey, Dan.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,738
Dan: Today, we had [chuckles] a
really- a really fun episode. We

15
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:40,476
sat down with Matt McInnis. He
is a ... I don't know. A data

16
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:42,651
scientist, a full-stack
engineer, a founder, used to be

17
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:44,826
a math

18
00:00:44,826 --> 00:00:48,216
professor. He- he had a real --
he has had a very interesting

19
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:51,667
journey and a very interesting
career. So it was very cool to

20
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:54,411
hear his -- can I just say very
a couple more times [laughs]?

21
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:57,155
I'm

22
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:58,521
excited though. It- it was- it
was- it was a fun time to sit

23
00:00:58,521 --> 00:00:59,886
down

24
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:03,962
with Matt. I don't know. He's
had a cool career-

25
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:03,962
Bekah: Yeah.

26
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:06,136
Dan: -and so many at different
things he's like gotten- gotten

27
00:01:06,136 --> 00:01:08,310
into. And he's

28
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:10,186
built a lot of different things
and, yeah. It was fun- it was a

29
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:12,061
fun

30
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:12,602
conversation.

31
00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:15,581
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, his
journey is super interesting,

32
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:21,432
going from math professor to
working at some really big tech

33
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:23,877
places. And talking about how he
got those jobs by building

34
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:26,292
things

35
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:30,072
that were useful to him, I felt
like was super inspiring to

36
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:33,701
anybody who's trying to break
into tech. But just to see how

37
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:35,426
he developed his career and
followed his interest is really

38
00:01:35,426 --> 00:01:37,000
...

39
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,792
I don't know, inspiring, I
guess.

40
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:41,921
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. And it-
it hit home for me a lot. It's-

41
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:43,811
it's

42
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:45,641
one of those things that I- I
never did consciously, and I

43
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:48,912
don't think Matt did really
either. He- he was -- he would

44
00:01:48,912 --> 00:01:50,217
build things that would help
him, you know, help himself. So

45
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:51,522
he

46
00:01:51,522 --> 00:01:54,611
talked about what he built,
something that was like helping

47
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:55,000
to buy tickets or sell tickets.
And-

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Bekah: Yeah.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,966
Dan: -it wasn't like a scheme to
make money or a scheme to get a

50
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:02,932
job [chuckles], you know? It was
just a

51
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:04,701
thing that helped him -- his-
his own, like, life, you know?

52
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:06,470
He

53
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,571
wasn't trying to sell the
product or do any of the things

54
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:10,671
that

55
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:14,301
you hear about these days a lot.
He just was like interested

56
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,752
in built something. And then
some people heard about it. And,

57
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:21,000
well, you'll hear about the rest
[laughs]. But it was cool.

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Bekah: [Chuckles] Yeah.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,396
Dan: It hit home for me. I- I --
that's -- building projects is

60
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:25,792
just like -- that's- that's --
my -- that's always

61
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:29,062
my advice to people too, is- is-
is just build things that you're

62
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:32,451
either interested in, or could
help yourself. And the rest

63
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,206
will come sort of naturally. So,
it was- it was cool. It was --

64
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:35,961
we --

65
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:37,671
I had a good time talking to
him.

66
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:41,752
Bekah: Yeah. It was fascinating
episode. And we hope that you

67
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:43,222
enjoy it and we're going to
start it the same way that we

68
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:44,692
start

69
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:48,622
every Virtual Coffee, with our
names, where we're from, what we

70
00:02:48,622 --> 00:03:00,127
do, and our random check-in
question. So, enjoy. Today's

71
00:03:00,152 --> 00:03:03,842
random check-in question is, if
you could appear on any game

72
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:06,347
show, what would it be? I'm
Bekah. I am a technical

73
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:08,852
community

74
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:13,157
builder from a small town in
Ohio. And game show ... I don't

75
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:17,461
know. If there

76
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:19,442
was a "Sudoku" game show, I
would like to try that

77
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:21,422
[chuckles]. I don't think

78
00:03:21,423 --> 00:03:24,000
that's a thing. So I guess I'll
go on "Wheel of Fortune"-

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Dan: Peep- pretty --

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,819
Bekah: -or, I don't know. "Price
Is Right". I feel like I'm -- as

81
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:29,638
an adult, I've

82
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:32,578
gotten better at that. Like
[chuckles], "Oh, I know the

83
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:35,518
price of that." But ...

84
00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:38,038
I don't know. I think I'll stick
with "Wheel of Fortune".

85
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:40,597
Dan: "Wheel of Fortune". Well,
it seemed like a fun- a fun

86
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:42,327
time, you know?

87
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:43,348
Bekah: It doesn't seem so
stressful.

88
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:45,882
Dan: I- I feel like- I feel like
a "Sudoku" game show would be

89
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:48,387
pretty boring to watch
[chuckles]. But before

90
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:49,603
they compete it- before they
compete it. But because, well, I

91
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:50,818
can tell --

92
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:53,298
Bekah: I mean, like some kind of
obstacles they threw in, right?

93
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:53,298
Dan: Ooh.

94
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:55,998
Bekah: Like, what you fill in
one row, then something

95
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:58,668
happened, and you get

96
00:03:58,668 --> 00:04:00,000
slimed. Like [Bekah and Matt
laugh] --

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Dan: Slimed [chuckles].

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,763
Bekah: Did you ever watch
"Double Dare" [chuckles]?

99
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:08,652
Dan: Oh, man. Okay. So, hi. I'm
Dan. I do front-end

100
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:13,252
development, mostly, and live in
Cleveland, and ... oh, yeah,

101
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,723
yeah. Game show, "American
Gladiators" is the first thing

102
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,382
that popped into my head.

103
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:18,617
Bekah: Ooh. I did [crosstalk] --
that's what I'm doing [laughs].

104
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,000
Matt McInnis: Oh, how are you
doing, sir?

105
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:21,347
Dan: [Laughs] I- I always wanted
to do -- especially the one --

106
00:04:21,347 --> 00:04:22,622
the, like,

107
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:25,083
thing I feel like they ended
with it. But the- the watery

108
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,808
run around, shooting the, like,
the Nerf guns at the, you know,

109
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,533
and

110
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:29,897
the -- like the- the gladiator
person is up on the top shooting

111
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:31,261
Nerf gun

112
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:32,402
stuff at your tennis [??] balls.
I- I don't really know. I

113
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:33,542
haven't

114
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:34,862
watched it, obviously, in a long
time, but [laughs] --

115
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:37,038
Bekah: "American Ninja Warrior",
too. I forgot. Ugh.

116
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:39,002
Dan: "American Ninja Warrior" is
cool. It -- that seems a lot

117
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:40,382
harder though. But it

118
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:43,293
would be cool to try. I would
definitely try that for sure.

119
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:44,327
Matt: But would you be a
contestant or one of the

120
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,301
gladiators, if you're in the
show?

121
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:47,252
Dan: Well, I mean, now I'd have
to start- I'd have to start as a

122
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:47,253
contestant, you know?

123
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Matt: Yeah. [Unintelligible].

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,386
Dan: I- I can't -- I'm not gonna
just like swoop in and, you

125
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:52,772
know? I gotta- I gotta earn my-
earn my way up,

126
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,192
right? [Dan and Matt laugh] But
yeah, I feel- I feel like --

127
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:59,551
plus it get the -- well, did

128
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:01,367
the contestants have the ...
what do you call them? Like a

129
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,182
... not a

130
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:05,522
jumpsuit, but the ... we called
these things, that they were ...

131
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,862
or like, that wrestlers or
anything?

132
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:08,000
Matt: Yeah, I think it's a suit.
I think it's a jumpsuit.

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Dan: No, no, no.

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,366
Matt: No, there's a name for it,
isn't that [laughs]? What's the

135
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:10,732
thing? We make it --

136
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,472
Dan: We need Nick here
[chuckles]. What's the thing

137
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:14,702
that like

138
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:16,000
wrestlers wear, like- like --

139
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Bekah: A singlet?

140
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,262
Dan: Nah -- yes, singlet maybe?
I don't know.

141
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:21,087
Matt: I think there's another
word for it, but it's- it's not

142
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,756
leotards, is it? No.

143
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:26,072
Dan: No. I mean, it's basically
leotard, but it's like singlet.

144
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:26,938
Bekah: It was a singlet. Singlet
is what you're wearing at

145
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:27,583
wrestling.

146
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:29,027
Dan: I don't know [chuckles]. I
don't know. That doesn't sound

147
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,002
right, but you're

148
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:31,597
probably right [Bekah and Matt
laugh]. We- we'll ask Nick

149
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,192
after- after the- after the
podcast [laugh].

150
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,588
Matt: Yeah. I -- good to be
here, guys. Thank you for having

151
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:42,048
me. I'm Matt. I'm a developer
from Toronto, Canada. I run a

152
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:43,562
small company called Typist
where we make educational

153
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:45,076
software. And

154
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:47,027
if I was on one game show, my
first — like, you know,

155
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:48,497
"American

156
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:51,197
Gladiator" wins — but my first
reaction was "Kids Street". It's

157
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:52,862
this old game show. I don't know
if I -- like, if I was 12 years

158
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:54,527
old

159
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:56,898
again, I think it, you know, and
everyone kind of clapped over

160
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,322
their head, like there is this,
like, thing that they did if

161
00:05:58,322 --> 00:05:59,746
they

162
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:01,547
got a question, right? And if
you won, it was like every kid's

163
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:03,347
dream, you got to

164
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:05,357
go into like this middle
platform. There was like stock,

165
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:07,366
like a toy

166
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,788
store? And you had like two
minutes to just grab-

167
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,788
Dan: Oh, man.

168
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:11,000
Matt: -whatever you wanted.

169
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Bekah: Ooh.

170
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,447
Matt: It was like -- yeah. So my
sisters and I, we would watch

171
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:15,753
"Kids Street" and we be like,
"How do we get on this TV show?"

172
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:17,028
And we

173
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:20,418
never quite cracked the egg on
that one. It was very- very

174
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:22,577
disappointing childhood, I
guess, you could say [laughs].

175
00:06:22,577 --> 00:06:24,736
Yeah. I'm kidding. But

176
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:26,872
it's a, yeah, kid's dream. But,
you know, I, you know, also

177
00:06:26,872 --> 00:06:29,007
second Dan's answer,

178
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:29,427
cuz that sounds awesome.

179
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:33,348
Bekah: Wow. I have never seen
"Kids Street" before.

180
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:35,442
Matt: Like -- yeah, there's this
funny kind of Canadian, you

181
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:36,747
know, from

182
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:40,468
Canada. This is funny Canadian
subculture around some

183
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:43,798
things. Like, there are these
really kind of weird things that

184
00:06:43,798 --> 00:06:46,648
pop up every now and then that
are extremely popular. Like,

185
00:06:46,648 --> 00:06:49,247
"Household", everybody knows
them. Even like music and bands

186
00:06:49,247 --> 00:06:52,468
sometimes. They were fueled by
this entertainment industry

187
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:53,487
that, like, out of Toronto. But
like, these companies called

188
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:54,506
MuchMusic,

189
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:57,358
and they're related
subsidiaries, but are just

190
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:58,543
totally unknown in the US. And
it -- which is funny because the

191
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,728
US

192
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:01,330
is just a two-hour drive from
where I'm living. Like, it

193
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,932
close, right? Like,

194
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:04,672
we're- we're right there. We- we
go to Buffalo Bills games all

195
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:06,412
the time.

196
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:08,273
It's across this, you know, it
feels like it's across the

197
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:09,503
street. But you go down there,
and they're like, "Oh, they

198
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:10,733
tragically

199
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,353
hip." And it like, every --
like, you know, half of Canada

200
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:13,973
is all

201
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:15,307
time favorite band, and people
in the US are like, "Who?" like,

202
00:07:15,307 --> 00:07:16,641
"Who

203
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:18,247
is that?" You know, it's --
there's these things. So "Kids

204
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:19,852
Street" might

205
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:23,273
be one of them too. And, you
know, all these like kinda old

206
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:24,262
TV shows for kids, especially.

207
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:27,407
Bekah: Yeah, I need to check it
out. I- I, like, pulled up the

208
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:29,072
-- oh, it is a

209
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:32,853
Canadian's children's game show.
So --

210
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:34,927
Matt: It is Canadian. I -- ah,
you guys missed out. This was

211
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:36,756
epic. Like [Bekah laughs] -- and
it would

212
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,047
have been -- it would have like
-- it would've been way better

213
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:39,337
if the US had done it [laughs].

214
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:43,462
Like, the mall would have been
cooler. Like, it would have just

215
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:45,427
been -- like- like, production
quality would

216
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:47,557
have been way up there. Like,
where's Nickelodeon at when-

217
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:48,663
Bekah: Yeah.

218
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,327
Matt: -for "Kids Street"
[laughs].

219
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:52,067
Bekah: I love it. It looks very
80s. I need to check this

220
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:52,338
out [chuckles].

221
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:54,048
Matt: Yeah, it was cool
[chuckles].

222
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,827
Bekah: Well, thanks so much for
being here with us today, Matt.

223
00:07:57,858 --> 00:08:02,208
We always like to get started
with your origin stories. So, if

224
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:07,517
you could give us what the story
is that brought you here to

225
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:08,838
today, where you are in tech.

226
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:13,228
Matt: Yeah, thanks. Thank you
for having me, Dan and Bekah.

227
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:15,589
Yeah. You know, I-I guess it-it
-- like starting -- focusing on

228
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:17,801
the tech side of

229
00:08:17,802 --> 00:08:21,973
things, I, you know, graduated
-- I did degrees in math. I love

230
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:24,647
math. I think it's still my
Twitter handle [chuckles]. I --

231
00:08:24,647 --> 00:08:27,311
and I -- and, you

232
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:29,502
know, I went -- I decided that,
like, the change I wanna make in

233
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:31,663
the world after graduating was I
wanted to improve the way that

234
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:33,103
people learn mathematics at the
post-secondary level. I- I just,

235
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:34,543
you

236
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:36,560
know, my -- their programs that
I took were massacres. We had

237
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,577
such few people

238
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:42,148
finish relative to how many
started. And, you know, I worked

239
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:44,398
all the way through university,
and math help centers, and as a

240
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:48,298
TA, and I saw people in non-math
disciplines kinda drop out of

241
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:50,368
their like early childhood
education program because they

242
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:52,147
couldn't complete their stats
course. And I thought that was

243
00:08:52,147 --> 00:08:53,926
crazy.

244
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:56,538
Because if it's taught properly,
I don't think math is hard,

245
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:58,938
you know? Put that strong
caveat, if it's taught properly.

246
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,128
And so I

247
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:03,947
really wanted to kind of affect
change there. I took a job. I

248
00:09:03,947 --> 00:09:06,977
applied everywhere for these --
in Canada, we call them 'math

249
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:10,638
professorships' at community
colleges in Canada. In US,

250
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:13,577
it's probably known as a 'math
instructor' at the community --

251
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:16,682
in the community college system.
And, so, I took a job in

252
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,302
Saskatchewan. I moved from the
small town of Aurora, Ontario —

253
00:09:18,302 --> 00:09:19,922
where

254
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:23,852
I grew up — to Prince Albert,
Saskatchewan, which is 40,000

255
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:25,757
person town, like in the, you
know, it- it was really awesome.

256
00:09:25,757 --> 00:09:27,662
I

257
00:09:27,663 --> 00:09:29,350
loved it out there, and I had
some family there too. And

258
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,037
that's

259
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:34,697
where, you know, I- I guess my
journey to tech started. I,

260
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,947
you know, I was a math person. I
really had no experience with

261
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:41,597
tech at that point. I was, you
know, 24 ... 23, 24. And

262
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:44,147
I- I just started wanting to
make things. I remember the

263
00:09:44,147 --> 00:09:46,697
first

264
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:48,437
thing I wanted to make was I had
read, you know, a book that's

265
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:50,177
now very

266
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:51,947
popular Malcolm Gladwell's
"[The] Tipping Point". And he

267
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:53,717
described

268
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:56,087
like "Sesame Street" in the 80s.
And how they would, like,

269
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,968
engineer this TV show. They
would bring kids in, and they

270
00:09:57,968 --> 00:09:59,273
would put

271
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:00,458
"Sesame Street" on one screen,
and this thing called the

272
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,643
distractor

273
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:05,182
on the other screen. And every
seven seconds, this

274
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:07,793
distractor would display these
still images that would switch.

275
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:10,283
So every seven seconds, a
different image. And you'd put

276
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:11,528
like 20 kids in the room, and
the researchers would just look

277
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,773
at

278
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:14,692
their eyes and be like, are they
looking at the distractor? Are

279
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:17,243
they looking at "Sesame Street"?
And then, they would go back and

280
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:19,523
they'd graph it after they'd
done, like a couple of cycles of

281
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:20,797
kids. And they'd see what are
the parts of the TV show that

282
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:22,071
kids

283
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:23,952
were disengaged with, that we
need to re-engineer? And that

284
00:10:23,952 --> 00:10:25,832
was like the

285
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,543
first that I was like, "Man, if
they could do that in the

286
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,633
80s, why can't, like in --" you
know, this was, I guess, like,

287
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,932
2010. I'm like, "Why can't we do
that, like, in real time, live,

288
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,470
while I'm teaching in class?"
And that was -- my first project

289
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,008
was I

290
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:40,427
wanted to build something that
did that. And I had learned that

291
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:43,217
Hasbro had put out this toy
called the hi- like the Star

292
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:45,302
Wars force trainer, where
everything was ridiculous

293
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:47,387
[chuckles]. So I -- we'd have
like

294
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:50,087
a headset that you'd put on. And
it turns out this thing could

295
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:52,337
actually take a, like a low
level EEG reading of brain

296
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:54,587
activity, like if

297
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,440
your brain was active or not.
And then, like, the toy would

298
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,293
connect

299
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:00,153
wirelessly to this base unit
that had a fan, that would spin

300
00:11:00,153 --> 00:11:02,013
a ball

301
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:04,952
up and down in this toy. And so
it like, hence the force

302
00:11:04,952 --> 00:11:07,263
trainer, is you concentrate
really hard, and you can use the

303
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:09,528
force to move this ball up and
down [laughs]. Like, really cool

304
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:11,793
toy, right? And I

305
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:12,843
said, "Well, if I could just get
the electrical signal out of

306
00:11:12,843 --> 00:11:13,893
that

307
00:11:13,893 --> 00:11:16,503
into my computer and graph it,
that would be the whole

308
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:20,283
thing." And that was my first
foray into tech, was -- I, like,

309
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:21,922
started -- I was like, "Okay.
Well, how do I get the

310
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:22,951
electrical

311
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:26,673
signal out? And how does- how
does electricity work? And how

312
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:29,942
does circuits work?" And, you
know, I learned about

313
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:32,582
microprocessors, and the Arduino
had to like just come out at the

314
00:11:32,582 --> 00:11:34,892
time. And so I started like
getting these -- like, yeah, I

315
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:37,202
found that

316
00:11:37,202 --> 00:11:38,252
kids' books for Arduino are
actually way better than the

317
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:39,302
ones they are

318
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:40,547
making for adults. So that -- I
got all these like kids' books

319
00:11:40,547 --> 00:11:41,792
and

320
00:11:42,212 --> 00:11:43,882
started like doing these
experiments. And then I- I

321
00:11:43,882 --> 00:11:45,552
needed, you

322
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:48,192
know, these wires solder. So I'd
go down to the electrical

323
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:49,287
department and be like, "Hey,
guy. I was teaching like math

324
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:50,382
for

325
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:51,643
electricians as part of my job
there." They're like, "Hey, can

326
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:52,903
you do

327
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:54,328
some soldering for me? And like,
put these --" And it, you know,

328
00:11:54,328 --> 00:11:55,753
at this

329
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:57,388
point, it would like kind of
become this, like, project, and

330
00:11:57,388 --> 00:11:59,023
I gotta

331
00:11:59,023 --> 00:12:03,222
working after, you know, on the
code side. I learned that

332
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,503
there's this language called
Processing, which was Java based

333
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:06,958
that could do the graphing
pretty easily for me if I could

334
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,023
just

335
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:10,153
pull the signal in. And I got
that working. And then I, you

336
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:12,283
know, like six

337
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:13,528
months later, presented it at a
conference down in Saskatoon —

338
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:14,773
one

339
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:16,747
of the cities in Saskatchewan.
And at that point, I was hooked.

340
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:18,721
And,

341
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:20,747
you know, from there, I- I just
-- I really wanted to continue

342
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:22,292
making

343
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:23,703
things that would make me a
better teacher. And that drove

344
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:25,113
me

345
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:28,113
for a long time. And then, you
know, a-a couple of years after

346
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:29,748
that, I- I started doing
reflection of what do I want in

347
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,383
terms of a

348
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,047
career, and a lifestyle, and
like, what are the things I'm

349
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:34,711
after?

350
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,452
And that really kind of led me
to getting interested in, you

351
00:12:36,452 --> 00:12:38,192
know, code

352
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:42,543
as a career. And there weren't
really, you know,

353
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:45,033
bootcamps and Coursera. I don't
even think they had been really

354
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,562
created at that point, or
launched, or, you know, the

355
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:48,091
whole suite of

356
00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:50,582
the EdEx, Udemy, Coursera,
awesome websites for these

357
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:54,363
things, right? So it was a lot
of learning. It was -- I, you

358
00:12:54,363 --> 00:12:57,092
know, I did that all while I had
a full-time job. And, you know,

359
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:59,492
fast forward a-a number of
years, I launched Typist — the

360
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,892
company I

361
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:03,737
now have run — I made a little
small passion project that I

362
00:13:03,737 --> 00:13:05,581
sometimes call

363
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:10,442
it. At the same time, I -- AI
exploded. And this was maybe

364
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:12,872
six or -- a six-ish -- six,
seven years ago now. At AI, if

365
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:15,302
nothing else,

366
00:13:15,302 --> 00:13:16,922
is a combination of computer
science, and it's like a really

367
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,542
strong

368
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:22,682
math background. And, you know,
back then, more emphasis on

369
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:25,113
the math, but today maybe more
emphasis on the computer science

370
00:13:25,113 --> 00:13:28,165
side. And- and so, I-IBM came
knocking and said, "Hey, we are

371
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:31,217
trying to

372
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,717
hire AI expertise." And I -- and
at that point, I had some

373
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:37,982
projects that like, I was
experimenting a lot in AI. And

374
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:40,247
so

375
00:13:40,248 --> 00:13:42,738
they brought me into -- they
offered me like dream job to go

376
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,912
in and be on this new open
source team that they're putting

377
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:47,086
across

378
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:48,767
Canada. And I'd get to work with
all their -- these huge

379
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:50,447
companies, and help

380
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:51,722
them do AI better, and solve
these problems. And that sounded

381
00:13:51,722 --> 00:13:52,997
like a

382
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,480
blast. So I did that for a
number of years. And then later,

383
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,962
I

384
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:59,503
moved over to Microsoft to do a
similar type work, like more-

385
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:01,633
more hands. I wanted to get
deeper into projects, and

386
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:02,773
Microsoft gave me that
opportunity to go deeper into

387
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:03,913
data

388
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:07,962
science projects with, you know,
companies. And all for

389
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:09,552
free. Like, these companies
would just parachute me in. Or

390
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:11,142
IBM would just --

391
00:14:11,232 --> 00:14:12,657
Microsoft would just parachute
me in, and it's like, "Yeah. We-

392
00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:14,082
we're

393
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:16,332
gonna help you do data science
better because if you do it on

394
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:17,774
our cloud, we're gonna make a
lot of money." So I'd get to go,

395
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,216
and just

396
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:21,768
like pick my projects, and go
onsite. I get like a badge. It

397
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:24,798
was awesome. And, you know, and
build out these data science

398
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,088
projects. And all the while, on
my evenings and weekends,

399
00:14:26,088 --> 00:14:27,378
building

400
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:29,088
out Typist, trying to get it to
the place where it could

401
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:30,798
support,

402
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,372
you know, a basic income for me,
and I could work on it

403
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,706
full-time,

404
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:38,057
which eventually happened. And-
and, you know, that sort of

405
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:39,990
switch over process was scary
and, you know, different than

406
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,923
I'm -- had

407
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,793
imagined it would be. But
eventually, my boss at Microsoft

408
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:47,382
was like, "Matt, you gotta go do
this. You- you -- it's there."

409
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:48,971
Like, "Go do this

410
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:52,302
thing." And- and I- and I did.
And I -- and that's what I've

411
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:54,253
been working on for the last
three or four years.

412
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:58,785
Bekah: That's- that's amazing. I
have to ask about that switch.

413
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:01,937
Cuz I

414
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:05,327
feel like that sounds like s-s-s
-- very scary [chuckles]. Like,

415
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:08,717
giving up all of the

416
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:12,918
stuff that you've been doing
with a team, with all of these

417
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:16,382
resources, and then just jumping
into this entrepreneur journey.

418
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,846
I- I know

419
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:23,687
that you said that you had some
encouragement, but like, what

420
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:27,227
really pushed you to go all in
on Typist?

421
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:31,687
Matt: Ah, you know, it was --
it- it was really, really hard.

422
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:38,253
You know, I- I- I guess, like, one
of the big factors was I thought

423
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:41,013
that we- we had a project lined
up for Typist. And- and Typist

424
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:43,413
--

425
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,753
maybe this is the appropriate
time to kinda speak to what it

426
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:50,552
is. We make software for
community college students who

427
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:52,277
are taking a certain set of
courses. So our- our first

428
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:54,002
product was

429
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:55,990
for community college students
who are taking keyboarding

430
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,977
courses. And

431
00:15:58,008 --> 00:16:00,798
those are people studying
programs to be law clerks, or

432
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:02,957
legal assistance, medical
assistance, or even executive

433
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:04,862
assistants. And very -- and, you
know, there's interesting

434
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:06,767
demographics

435
00:16:06,768 --> 00:16:09,197
in those programs, such as -- a
reason I'm really passionate to

436
00:16:09,197 --> 00:16:13,638
work on and honored to build
software for that group. And

437
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:15,182
then we have this second
product, which at that point,

438
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,726
Bekah, was --

439
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,852
I was really -- we had scoped it
out. And it was the -- and this

440
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:22,527
thing called

441
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:25,408
'document production'. So, you
know, people that go in these

442
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:26,757
fields need to be able to make a
professionally formatted

443
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:28,106
business

444
00:16:28,107 --> 00:16:30,778
letter that has these exact
traits and the -- it's sort of a

445
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:34,827
vocational skill. And in that
particular field, it's rated as

446
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,567
like a top three employment
skill to -- by all every

447
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:38,307
industry

448
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:41,278
survey that's ever been done.
And it's really, really hard to

449
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,952
teach. And I -- we had -- one of
the colle- I've been like kinda

450
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:47,912
kicking the tires with the
people who are using our

451
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:48,872
keyboarding

452
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:49,993
software, and be like, "Hey,
does anyone wanna partner to

453
00:16:49,993 --> 00:16:51,113
build this with us?

454
00:16:51,373 --> 00:16:52,927
And by partner, just like give
us feedback, tell us- tell us

455
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:54,481
what

456
00:16:54,482 --> 00:16:56,102
to build, like whiteboard. And-
and ideally, if we build you

457
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,722
something

458
00:16:57,722 --> 00:16:59,732
that you really liked, be the,
you know, the person to use it

459
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:01,742
and give us

460
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:04,952
the reference so that we can
maybe expand this." And I -- and

461
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:06,017
that was a big part of the
decision was I had all that

462
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:07,022
lined

463
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:11,883
up. And so for the six to seven
months prior to that, and

464
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:15,423
this was the final push, I had
outsourced the development of it

465
00:17:15,423 --> 00:17:20,252
to a really great developer who
-- it -- like, grades, you know,

466
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:24,992
really, really talented Rails
developer. And we had a

467
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:28,323
prototype. And we went back to
this college and presented this.

468
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:30,153
And I'd take vacation days
anytime I had to go take

469
00:17:30,153 --> 00:17:31,682
meetings, right? So all of my
vacation for those like four

470
00:17:31,682 --> 00:17:33,211
years was

471
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:36,272
consumed by Typist. And so I'd
take a vacation day. I'd go,

472
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:37,607
and we'd present this back to
the group. And they had said,

473
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:38,942
"Yes. If

474
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,012
you can build it and it can do
these things, but we need these

475
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:45,573
changes, you know, we'll use
it." But at that point, I looked

476
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:47,703
with -- like- like, how we had
constructed the software. And I

477
00:17:47,703 --> 00:17:49,833
said, "It's not

478
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,618
gonna get us to the finish
line." We were, you know,

479
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:53,403
specifically we'd

480
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:55,008
built it in Rails, and it --
like, it all works with file IO.

481
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,613
So either you

482
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:58,358
need to upload this file and
then we would go compare it to

483
00:17:58,358 --> 00:18:00,093
this

484
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:01,592
other file. And they're both
Word documents, which are

485
00:18:01,592 --> 00:18:03,031
incredibly

486
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:03,033
hard to work with.

487
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

488
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,004
Matt: And we, like, you know,
the- the way all the existing

489
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:10,008
previous software, like, if
there's a typo in a paragraph,

490
00:18:10,248 --> 00:18:12,647
you lost all the marks of the
paragraph, because doing fuzzy

491
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:14,777
matching is like really, really
hard. And we just -- I- I sat

492
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:16,907
there

493
00:18:16,907 --> 00:18:18,077
and I'm like, "We can't do this
in our web server." This -- it

494
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:19,247
takes like 20

495
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:20,912
seconds to process a single
file, we'll be in classes,

496
00:18:20,912 --> 00:18:22,576
they'll do a test,

497
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:24,512
they'll get 30 uploads at once,
we'll never be able to handle

498
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:25,742
the spike in

499
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:28,313
traffic, we'll never be able to
-- we- we don't wanna web server

500
00:18:28,313 --> 00:18:29,938
sitting idle for it. And I just,
long story short, knew and I --

501
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:31,563
we had to

502
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:34,442
rebuild the software completely
from scratch. And we had five

503
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:37,432
months to do it. We had gone in
and already produced like -- we

504
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:38,732
already done the demo and been
like, "Yeah, it's working.

505
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:40,022
Look."

506
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:42,722
And I knew that we had to throw
away everything that we'd done,

507
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,962
and build it from scratch, and
-- which we did. So that was

508
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:48,122
like the imme- there's an
immediacy which helped, I guess,

509
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:50,282
make that decision

510
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:51,827
of like, I'd -- like -- so when
I went in and had that

511
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:53,372
conversation with

512
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:55,082
my wonderful, wonderful boss, I
was scay [??], and I was

513
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:56,791
explaining

514
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:59,267
this all to her. She's like --
I'm- I'm like -- I was scay

515
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:01,742
[??], I've like, "If

516
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:05,133
we're gonna launch this thing
and this could push Typist over

517
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:08,522
the mark of, like, it could
support a couple employees,

518
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:11,238
I've got to go now. Like, I- I-
I can't wait till next week.

519
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:13,008
I've- I've got to

520
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:17,357
start, right now." And she's
like, "Yep. Do it." And at that

521
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,947
point, I ... like almost on the
spot gave my notice. I talked to

522
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:20,537
my

523
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:25,788
wife and- and that was the jump.
And it was a hard summer, by the

524
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:26,087
way [chuckles]. It was tough.

525
00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:29,848
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that's
pretty intense. [Chuckles] I

526
00:19:29,848 --> 00:19:31,223
mean, obviously I don't [Dan and
Matt chuckle] ...

527
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:37,114
but it seems like it worked out,
right? I mean, kinda betting

528
00:19:37,114 --> 00:19:38,000
on yourself and -- I mean, it-

529
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Matt: Yeah.

530
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,351
Dan: -might be wasn't much of a
bet. Have you -- did you have a

531
00:19:41,351 --> 00:19:43,702
good idea of -- so you said you
had to, you know, tear it down

532
00:19:43,702 --> 00:19:46,053
and- and rebuild

533
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:48,108
it. Did you have a good idea at
that, like, moment of like what

534
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:50,162
it was

535
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:52,713
gonna look like when you were
finished rebuilding it or were

536
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:53,943
you just like, we have, like --
are start from scratch, and I

537
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,173
have no

538
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:55,923
idea, you know?

539
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:58,239
Matt: Yeah. We- we knew that --
and- and I did. And maybe, you

540
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,394
know, I -- and

541
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:01,963
I'm happy to speak to the kinda
the details of it, because I

542
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:03,000
think they're interesting if
that's ... you know?

543
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Bekah: Yeah, sure.

544
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Dan: Yeah.

545
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,392
Matt: So, like, we, you know, I
mentioned we couldn't do this on

546
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:09,784
web servers. Because like, you

547
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:11,209
know, the really simple use case
was that if 20 students are

548
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,634
doing

549
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:13,698
a test, and they all upload
their documents at once, and

550
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:14,762
they take

551
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:16,593
25 seconds to process, web
servers just can't do that. We

552
00:20:16,593 --> 00:20:18,423
would have

553
00:20:18,423 --> 00:20:21,243
to have like this incredible
scale that would just be so

554
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:26,709
expensive, we couldn't run the
business. And so, the -- my-

555
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,248
my theory was that we needed a
couple of things. We needed to

556
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:31,537
not be

557
00:20:31,538 --> 00:20:33,293
using Ruby because like a- a
Node based system made a lot

558
00:20:33,293 --> 00:20:35,048
more

559
00:20:35,048 --> 00:20:38,078
sense in the way that a Node
event loop works, you know? And-

560
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:40,433
and the second thing was we
needed a way to deploy these

561
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:42,308
sort

562
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,433
of algorithms that we were
building in a way that can

563
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:44,558
handle

564
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,534
these spikes in traffic. And at
that point, sort of lamb- this

565
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:51,773
Lambda architecture which is,
you know, all the clouds have a

566
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:53,408
product for this. So in
Microsoft is called Azure

567
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:55,043
functions, in AWS

568
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:57,518
is called Lambda, in -- you can
have -- net- Netlify just

569
00:20:57,518 --> 00:20:59,992
launched one, I

570
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:02,034
think, actually, and Cloudflare
has one called Cloudflare

571
00:21:02,034 --> 00:21:03,728
functions too. But they
basically work that like

572
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:05,422
something happens,

573
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:06,863
and these -- they spin up your
code, and they do the thing you

574
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:08,303
want it to do, and

575
00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:11,394
then they spin down, and you can
throw a thousand at them. And

576
00:21:11,423 --> 00:21:13,673
they, you know, a thousand
instances will spit up, you'll

577
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,350
pay for the time they're up, and
then they'll turn off, and

578
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,027
you're done. And so

579
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:19,023
that was kind of what I knew was
that we had to rewrite this into

580
00:21:19,023 --> 00:21:20,958
that --

581
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:23,898
this Lambda type architecture
that could handle these spikes.

582
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:25,753
We had to use -- we had to
switch languages. So we had to

583
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:27,077
use a

584
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,368
language that was compatible
there in -- while supported, and

585
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:29,658
Ruby

586
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:31,398
wasn't supported at all. So that
had to go to JavaScript. And

587
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:33,137
then

588
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:35,628
there was, you know, to your
question, Dan, there- there were

589
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,688
questions that I was really,
really concerned about, which

590
00:21:37,688 --> 00:21:39,748
were, how

591
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:41,698
are we going to go in and like
that problem on evaluation? So

592
00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:43,647
if

593
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:44,728
you're a student, you upload
this document, and you're off by,

594
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:45,808
like,

595
00:21:45,808 --> 00:21:49,229
two characters, we couldn't take
off all of the marks, right? So

596
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:52,648
we had to be able to go in and
compare the texts. We expected

597
00:21:52,648 --> 00:21:54,328
students to type in the text
that they did type, and take off

598
00:21:54,328 --> 00:21:56,008
some of -- like of -- like

599
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:00,028
type of marks of as proportions
to do that, and give meaningful

600
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,398
feedback on the other side. And
at that point, I had no idea how

601
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:07,433
we're gonna solve that problem.
Yeah, which we, you know, later

602
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:10,463
figured out a way to. And even
just converting, like, how do we

603
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,188
even -- so, you know, just as a
quick comment, DOCX files are

604
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:13,913
really

605
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:15,834
hard to work with, but here's
like a fun thing you can do. If

606
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,574
you're on a Windows machine,
take a DOCX file to your

607
00:22:17,574 --> 00:22:19,314
desktop, rename

608
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:22,314
it to .zip. And then extract it,
and you'll see the general how

609
00:22:22,314 --> 00:22:25,314
these struck-

610
00:22:25,913 --> 00:22:27,233
files are structured. In-
inside, there is all this kind

611
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:28,553
of markup

612
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:30,324
that will be a little bit
familiar to you if you've seen

613
00:22:30,324 --> 00:22:34,163
XML or HTML before. And you can
see all the stuff in there.

614
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:35,573
So we knew that we had to like
deal with that problem too,

615
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:36,983
which

616
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:39,503
we didn't know how we were gonna
handle, because we were using

617
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:41,933
these Ruby libraries that kind
of abstracted that away for us.

618
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:46,283
Bekah: Mm. Yeah. So you made
this career journey, I guess. So

619
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,563
from

620
00:22:48,564 --> 00:22:54,443
math and then you were doing AI,
data science stuff, and then

621
00:22:54,653 --> 00:23:00,324
Rails back-end stuff, and- and
now JavaScript and React, right?

622
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,999
Matt: Yeah. And- and, you know,
I think the first part of that

623
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:07,838
would be like, it's worth
expanding on, like, it was --

624
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:09,623
like when I started learning
code, it, like -- I, you know,

625
00:23:09,623 --> 00:23:11,348
data

626
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,601
science is generally on in
Python and R. Like, those are

627
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:13,854
the

628
00:23:13,854 --> 00:23:17,034
language for data science, and
heavy emphasis on Python these

629
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:20,394
days. Like, academic, C's are,
but nobody else really does.

630
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,523
And so the -- like, I really
didn't know a ton of Python, but

631
00:23:22,523 --> 00:23:24,113
it's

632
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:27,834
such an approachable language. I
really, that -- like that seven

633
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:30,266
years of learning code, like,
you know, I- I breezed past it

634
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:32,698
in a

635
00:23:32,699 --> 00:23:35,699
sentence, but that was really
hard. It was a lot of evenings

636
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:39,419
and weekends. I was working full
time that whole time, I, at some

637
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,929
points, had like even taking on
contract gigs, doing statistical

638
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:46,979
consulting for some stuff. And-
and it was webdev that I was

639
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:48,538
learning during that time,
Bekah. And it was, you know, I

640
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:50,097
had

641
00:23:50,098 --> 00:23:52,375
started the -- with a -- like
[chuckles], you know, I started

642
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,652
with HTML, and

643
00:23:54,653 --> 00:23:56,303
CSS, and had like -- learned
that, and built a personal

644
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:57,953
website.

645
00:23:57,953 --> 00:24:00,473
And it was like, you know, these
projects, all the way through,

646
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:02,768
like I wanted -- like at the
time people were downloading TV

647
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:05,063
shows

648
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:06,788
and movies and stuff, maybe
[chuckles], you know, maybe they

649
00:24:06,788 --> 00:24:08,512
shouldn't. But it

650
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:09,833
was like really hard. So, like,
if I wanted to go -- if I

651
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,153
download the new season

652
00:24:11,513 --> 00:24:12,743
of "The Office", I wanted to
search "The Office", and have it

653
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:13,973
organized,

654
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:15,488
like Episode 1, Episode 2,
Episode 3, and then get rid of

655
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:17,003
the ones that

656
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:18,766
were like somebody holding their
camera, and do others. So, does

657
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:20,438
a website

658
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:25,088
to do that? And it was like so
basic. It was a single PHP file

659
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:29,259
that just went and like kind of
scraped the Pirate Bay, and then

660
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:31,388
analyze the file names. And
then, I- I had no idea how to

661
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,428
use

662
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:35,049
databases, so it would just
stick the results [chuckles]

663
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:36,669
into like a text

664
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:38,926
file [laughs]. I'm like, "Go,
daddy." So it was -- like,

665
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:41,183
that's where I was

666
00:24:41,183 --> 00:24:41,184
starting from. And-

667
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Dan: That's awesome.

668
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,057
Matt: -it was -- so there's
like, there's that. There were

669
00:24:45,057 --> 00:24:48,114
... oh, like, oh my god. There's
so many other. Like

670
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:50,304
another one that was fun was
when I was teaching at the

671
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:52,638
college, you'd put all your
marks into like an Excel doc. So

672
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:54,972
I was like,

673
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:56,248
"Okay. Well, I want, like, to give
my students more contextual

674
00:24:56,248 --> 00:24:57,523
feedback

675
00:24:57,523 --> 00:24:58,588
on how they're doing in the
course." So I put it into a

676
00:24:58,588 --> 00:24:59,653
Google

677
00:24:59,653 --> 00:25:00,628
doc and I was like, "How do I
get this thing to send email?"

678
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:01,603
And

679
00:25:01,604 --> 00:25:03,163
then that was like, one of the
first things I had written in

680
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:06,614
JavaScript, was to like, go take
all my students, and if they're

681
00:25:06,614 --> 00:25:08,308
like -- if they've not done well
on the first two quizzes, send

682
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:10,002
them

683
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:11,763
an email that's like, "Hey, you
know, John. I- I saw you didn't

684
00:25:11,763 --> 00:25:13,523
do

685
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:15,594
very well in the first few
quizzes. Here are my office

686
00:25:15,594 --> 00:25:16,944
hours. There's also the math
help center if you need support.

687
00:25:16,944 --> 00:25:18,294
I'm

688
00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:21,473
here for you. Like, you know,
like, really wanna help you turn

689
00:25:21,473 --> 00:25:22,628
this around [chuckles]." And
then, if they were doing really

690
00:25:22,628 --> 00:25:23,783
well, they'd get

691
00:25:23,784 --> 00:25:25,148
like a more positive note with
different content. And there

692
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,512
were -- I had like

693
00:25:26,513 --> 00:25:27,443
six different templates, and
then I would just hit go, and

694
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:28,373
then

695
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:29,558
everybody would get an email
from me, and like my five

696
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:30,742
[unintelligible] sections or

697
00:25:30,743 --> 00:25:31,074
whatever. I [laughs] --

698
00:25:33,084 --> 00:25:35,288
Bekah: [Laughs] I- I- I need
that 10 years ago. That would

699
00:25:35,288 --> 00:25:37,492
save me so much

700
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:40,044
time. Wow. That's amazing.

701
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:42,203
Matt: It's great. But like, the
part that I felt guilty about,

702
00:25:42,203 --> 00:25:43,433
Bekah, it was I'd get

703
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:44,963
these responses, and be like,
"Wow. You -- thank you for

704
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:46,493
taking the time to

705
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:49,763
write me this email [all
laughs]." Yeah. You know- you

706
00:25:49,763 --> 00:25:53,033
know? I -- it was -- but they
were like --

707
00:25:53,673 --> 00:25:54,978
Bekah: I thought that's a --
wait. Is that not a product for

708
00:25:54,978 --> 00:25:56,283
teachers? Because if

709
00:25:56,284 --> 00:25:58,713
it's not, it totally should be.

710
00:25:58,713 --> 00:25:58,933
Matt: It should be.

711
00:25:58,933 --> 00:25:59,263
Dan: Was it just like -- that's
like-

712
00:25:59,423 --> 00:25:59,874
Matt: Yeah.

713
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:01,634
Dan: -a CRM, right? A CRM,
except for students, is like,

714
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:03,374
you have

715
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:04,798
all the automated- automated
mail campaigns and stuff, you

716
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:06,222
know [laughs]?

717
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:09,044
Except you're- except you're
emailing students. It's amazing.

718
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:09,614
Bekah: Yes. Yeah. Okay. But this
-- I [Matt laughs] need to

719
00:26:09,614 --> 00:26:10,124
Google this after we're done.
Because-

720
00:26:10,243 --> 00:26:10,973
Dan: It has to exist.

721
00:26:11,443 --> 00:26:14,324
Bekah: -if- if it is a thing, I
need to tell everybody that I

722
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,469
know — that still a teacher —
about it. And if not, then

723
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:18,614
that's my new

724
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:19,124
project [chuckles].

725
00:26:19,838 --> 00:26:21,248
Matt: Yeah. It's, you know, so
that was like -- there were

726
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:22,658
these

727
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:25,449
projects on the way, right? And
they were all usually connected

728
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:27,788
to something I wanted to see in
the world. Like -- and another

729
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:29,288
really big one I took on, that
was like less code, but it was,

730
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,788
you

731
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:34,388
know, it was my first experience
with Rails was, you know, we

732
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:36,315
had -- I was teaching at the
college and I was helping to

733
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:38,242
volunteer

734
00:26:38,243 --> 00:26:40,374
coach this marketing team, which
I don't know what I was

735
00:26:40,374 --> 00:26:44,334
doing there. I was, like, the math
guy, right? And I -- but I

736
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:46,644
wanted to get my students more
experiencing the actual -- like,

737
00:26:46,644 --> 00:26:47,708
the part of marketing that
really is interesting to me is

738
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:48,772
the

739
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,894
analytics of it. There's really
rich analytics and the math is

740
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:56,183
just super fun to look at, but
there is like, Google Analytics

741
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:57,428
was out there at the time. But
it was really hard to get

742
00:26:57,428 --> 00:26:58,673
experience

743
00:26:58,673 --> 00:26:59,618
with actual data. So I thought,
"Well, what if we could get like

744
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,563
a

745
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:03,864
website up that would, you know,
have a bunch of data that

746
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:05,303
students could just mess around
with? And we could like do

747
00:27:05,303 --> 00:27:06,742
stuff.

748
00:27:06,743 --> 00:27:09,503
We could go put posters up and
drive traffic." And- and then

749
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:10,763
like, I was also really
interested in — and still am —

750
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:11,813
in

751
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:14,124
volunteerism. And I said, "You
know, I've had these great,

752
00:27:14,124 --> 00:27:16,794
wonderful, like life-changing
experience volunteering. Like,

753
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:21,804
you know, what if we could drive
more volunteers to charities?"

754
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:25,074
And, you know, I was also really
attracted to short video format.

755
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:27,579
So, I sorta took the summer off
and I emailed the -- sort of

756
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,084
CEOs of

757
00:27:30,263 --> 00:27:32,168
charities in Toronto, and said,
"Hey, I- I went on, you know,

758
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:34,073
Facebook and

759
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:36,144
Craigslist trying to find a
videographer who involved here

760
00:27:36,144 --> 00:27:37,688
with me." And I did. And we went
-- my- my pitch was like, "Hey,

761
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:39,232
we're

762
00:27:39,233 --> 00:27:41,483
gonna take your CEO. We're gonna
go onsite where

763
00:27:41,483 --> 00:27:44,034
volunteerism is happening. We're
gonna shoot like a 45 second

764
00:27:44,034 --> 00:27:46,973
to one minute video of you
telling volunteers why it would

765
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:48,713
be so great to volunteer with
your -- ther- your organization."

766
00:27:48,713 --> 00:27:50,453
And we did that.

767
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:51,623
And we did like five of the
biggest charities in Toronto.

768
00:27:51,623 --> 00:27:52,793
And

769
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:54,459
we put them on a website I call
[chuckles] -- that I called

770
00:27:54,459 --> 00:27:56,124
Where The Good Is. And

771
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:58,074
then we took the marketing ever
since. We promoted it around the

772
00:27:58,074 --> 00:27:59,498
college, and then, like, we'd
Google in with [unintelligible],

773
00:27:59,498 --> 00:28:00,922
that they would

774
00:28:00,923 --> 00:28:03,203
like drive the traffic to the
website, we got to analyze it

775
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:04,793
all. And it was really fun. And
that was, like, my first website

776
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:06,383
in

777
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,023
Rails. It was a static web page
with just a bunch of videos, but

778
00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:11,258
it was a great way to learn.
And- and- and there's probably

779
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:13,253
like a million

780
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:15,361
other projects that a little,
you know, similar. But those --

781
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,469
that's what I was learning. That

782
00:28:17,618 --> 00:28:20,169
seven years was -- I was really
getting into web development. I

783
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:24,128
loved it. I loved making things.
And the more relevant they were

784
00:28:24,128 --> 00:28:26,303
for me, the better. And, you
know, my last one, which was

785
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:28,478
like

786
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:30,008
a full Rails app — that was just
a static page, right — was this

787
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,537
-- I

788
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:33,368
wanted a Chrome extension. So my
wife, my -- who was my

789
00:28:33,368 --> 00:28:35,198
girlfriend

790
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:37,598
at the time, we could just hit a
button in Chrome, and we could

791
00:28:37,598 --> 00:28:39,308
share the webpage that we're
looking at with like a little

792
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:41,739
note. And it would just like
jumped to the other person's

793
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:43,196
browser. And so I built a little
app that did that. And that was

794
00:28:43,196 --> 00:28:44,653
like

795
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:47,908
the first, you know, full ...
like real, meaningful, like, web

796
00:28:47,908 --> 00:28:51,163
app, you

797
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,458
know? Like, they did stuff on
the back end and use the

798
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,753
database. And- and, you

799
00:28:55,753 --> 00:28:58,663
know, during that time also,
courses started coming out. So

800
00:28:58,663 --> 00:29:01,513
I took wonderful database course
from Stanford, and then, the

801
00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:04,993
University of Washington has
amazing courses. And- and

802
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,824
that allowed me to kinda get to
the bottom of how these things

803
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:09,969
worked, which I was incredibly
curious about. Like, the

804
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:11,828
hardware/software interface
course from the University of

805
00:29:11,828 --> 00:29:12,773
Washington is just straight up
one of the best courses I've

806
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:13,718
ever

807
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,114
taken. Like -- it's like how it,
like, it tackles the problem of

808
00:29:15,114 --> 00:29:16,509
--

809
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:19,749
like, how does the code you type
in Python change things in a

810
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:22,358
computer, and how does the
computer work it all? And that

811
00:29:22,358 --> 00:29:25,568
was like the missing gap that I
needed to kind of address. And

812
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:29,189
that was a wonderful experience.
And- and yeah, that's what --

813
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:31,778
like, that seven years was like.
And- and then towards the end of

814
00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:33,188
it, the- the project that I
made, that kind of got the

815
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,598
attention of IBM

816
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:37,448
was, I had like -- had -- this
is [chuckles]- this is -- am I-

817
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:39,308
am I rambling here? I feel like
I'm

818
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:39,759
talking about --

819
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:40,509
Bekah: No. This is great.

820
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:40,509
Dan: No.

821
00:29:41,078 --> 00:29:43,418
Matt: The -- had I -- the ever
big baseball fan, I've got my

822
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:45,758
little

823
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,214
Blue Jays hat in the background
on- on the yellow shirt behind

824
00:29:47,214 --> 00:29:48,669
me.

825
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:50,738
And- and we love going to the
Home Opener, which is the first

826
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:52,807
baseball

827
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:55,643
game of the year. And I had
gone, and we buy tickets, but

828
00:29:55,643 --> 00:29:58,117
they always

829
00:29:58,118 --> 00:30:00,338
sell out, so you have to buy
resale. And resales like three

830
00:30:00,338 --> 00:30:02,393
times the price. And we paid --
that one year, we paid like

831
00:30:02,393 --> 00:30:04,448
$110,

832
00:30:04,568 --> 00:30:07,328
which was outrageous at the time
to sit in like $20 seats at, like,

833
00:30:07,328 --> 00:30:09,138
the top of the stadium. And I
was so upset by this, you know?

834
00:30:09,138 --> 00:30:10,948
I

835
00:30:10,949 --> 00:30:12,679
was ... really. And then, you
know, one of my friends can

836
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:14,409
come. So I

837
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:15,936
had to -- like, I tried to scalp
the ticket. So I was like

838
00:30:15,936 --> 00:30:17,463
outside the

839
00:30:17,463 --> 00:30:19,218
stadium [Bekah giggles] instead
of like -- and I, like, had, you

840
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:20,973
know, a couple of

841
00:30:21,273 --> 00:30:23,223
bottles of juice to give myself
the courage to do it [Matt and

842
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:25,173
Dan laugh]. And- and so, I'm-
I'm

843
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:26,989
standing outside the stadium
with my best cover and I was

844
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:28,144
like, "Tickets?

845
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:31,308
[Bekah laughs] Do you guys need
tickets?" And I remember there's

846
00:30:31,308 --> 00:30:34,443
this -- I'd -- like, of all --
there's 50,000

847
00:30:34,443 --> 00:30:36,304
people there, of course, like a
friend walks by, and he's like,

848
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:37,564
"What in the hell are you
doing?" and "What in the heck

849
00:30:37,564 --> 00:30:38,824
you

850
00:30:38,824 --> 00:30:40,398
do?" And then I'll -- there -- I
never forget this mom and her

851
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:41,972
daughter. The

852
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,768
daughter must've been like 17,
18 years old, right? And they're-

853
00:30:43,768 --> 00:30:45,563
they're walking

854
00:30:45,564 --> 00:30:47,273
by and I'm out there just,
"Tickets," [Bekah chuckles] and,

855
00:30:47,273 --> 00:30:48,982
"You need a ticket?" And she's
so

856
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:51,578
politely says, "No, thank you."
Everyone just ignores it, and

857
00:30:51,578 --> 00:30:54,173
she just, "No, thank you." And
she looks at me, and then

858
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:57,324
looks down at my shirt, and I've
got my University Western shirt

859
00:30:57,324 --> 00:30:59,094
on [Bekah chuckles], and she
doesn't -- like, her face just

860
00:30:59,094 --> 00:31:00,864
drops. And she looks at

861
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,818
her daughter who's, like, also got
a Western shirt- [Matt and Bekah

862
00:31:03,818 --> 00:31:06,772
laugh] shirt on. It just had

863
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:08,843
this, like sad look of horror as
they walk into this thing, you

864
00:31:08,843 --> 00:31:10,913
know? Like, "This

865
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:13,353
is what my daughter is gonna
be." I've -- but anyways, that

866
00:31:13,353 --> 00:31:15,793
whole

867
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:19,213
experience has really upsetting.
And, so I'm like -- well, you

868
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:22,903
know, I learned that if you
bought season tickets for, like,

869
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:26,233
all 90 games in a season, then
you would get like a 15%

870
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:29,533
discount,

871
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:31,348
and then I could get the $20
ticket. And so, of course, you

872
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,162
know,

873
00:31:33,294 --> 00:31:36,223
what- what's a reasonable thing
to do is spend $9,000 on season

874
00:31:36,223 --> 00:31:39,913
tickets. Yeah. So I basically
took 2/3 of my savings in

875
00:31:39,913 --> 00:31:42,864
my bank account, and I funded
the money on season tickets. But

876
00:31:42,864 --> 00:31:47,213
my theory was, I could sell them
at face value to my friends. And

877
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:50,124
since I got this like 15%
discount, that would more than

878
00:31:50,124 --> 00:31:53,993
make up for the gap. And- and
Pam and I could go to like three

879
00:31:53,993 --> 00:31:57,114
or four games for free, which is
all I really wanted. And -- but

880
00:31:57,114 --> 00:31:59,273
to do that, I needed to figure
out how to price all these

881
00:31:59,273 --> 00:32:01,710
tickets. And so I wrote a
Electron desktop app that went

882
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,147
and scraped

883
00:32:04,148 --> 00:32:06,759
all the data from bluejays.com,
and scraped all the data from

884
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,813
StubHub, and I wrote an
algorithm to -- it like, you

885
00:32:08,813 --> 00:32:10,867
know, if you scrape

886
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:12,848
StubHub one day, and you scrape
the next day, you can figure out

887
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,648
what tickets are not there
anymore. And then you can figure

888
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:15,000
out what's sold and for what
price-

889
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Bekah: Oh, wow.

890
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,054
Matt: -since you knew [??] all
the things. And so I built a

891
00:32:18,054 --> 00:32:20,108
really nice clean data set, and
then I

892
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:23,558
trained an algorithm to price my
tickets. And, you know,

893
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:26,104
again, I have this Electron app.
And I just click a button, it'll

894
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:27,859
price on my tickets, send an
email to my friends, and- and

895
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:29,614
then

896
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:34,294
people just earmarked what
tickets I want. And- and it

897
00:32:34,294 --> 00:32:35,944
worked. And I did that for, you
know, I've been doing that for

898
00:32:35,944 --> 00:32:37,594
four,

899
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:39,484
five years now, or six years, I
guess. This is -- there's like

900
00:32:39,484 --> 00:32:41,074
two

901
00:32:41,074 --> 00:32:43,564
year gap that I, you know,
decided not to do it because of

902
00:32:43,564 --> 00:32:47,824
COVID. And- and then that got
the attention of IBM. I

903
00:32:47,824 --> 00:32:50,854
mean, like, "Hey, that's a really
awesome project. And that's what

904
00:32:50,854 --> 00:32:52,296
kind of opened that door." But
it was, you know [laughs], all

905
00:32:52,296 --> 00:32:53,738
these --

906
00:32:55,423 --> 00:32:58,258
Bekah: That's -- when I- when I
was leaving education to come

907
00:32:58,258 --> 00:33:01,093
into

908
00:33:01,094 --> 00:33:03,883
tech, I made money. I- I
remember the most money I made,

909
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:06,672
I bought and

910
00:33:06,673 --> 00:33:09,183
resold Justin Bieber tickets on
StubHub [Bekah and Matt laugh].

911
00:33:09,183 --> 00:33:11,693
And it was a lot of

912
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:15,683
research. Again, that would have
been something that would have

913
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:17,784
been very useful to me during
that time.

914
00:33:18,189 --> 00:33:18,699
Matt: Oh, yeah.

915
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:20,739
Bekah: Wow, that's amazing.
Justin Bieber also made me a lot

916
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:22,644
of money, so I

917
00:33:22,644 --> 00:33:24,263
don't hate Justin Bieber. He's
great [chuckles].

918
00:33:24,814 --> 00:33:27,334
Matt: He's Canadian, yeah. He's
from down the road there. The --

919
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:28,054
Bekah: That's right [laughs].

920
00:33:28,594 --> 00:33:30,364
Matt: And we have a lot of mixed
feelings about Justin Bieber.

921
00:33:30,364 --> 00:33:33,079
But they're generally positive.
He's- he's doing his best [Matt

922
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:35,794
and Bekah laugh]. I'm glad he
did well by you, Bekah.

923
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:35,973
That's good.

924
00:33:37,644 --> 00:33:40,261
Bekah: Yeah. Wow. That -- there
... I don't know what to say

925
00:33:40,261 --> 00:33:42,878
other than that's

926
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:45,083
amazing. And oh, what I did
wanna say was, for -- we have a

927
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:47,288
lot

928
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:50,679
of people who are listening to
the podcast, who are coming into

929
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,434
tech, and I really love all
these stories that you're

930
00:33:52,434 --> 00:33:54,189
telling,

931
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:58,328
because all of the things that
you made were useful to you, and

932
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:01,269
they made sense for you to make.
And so there's always that

933
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:02,423
question of like, "Well, what am
supposed to be doing? And what

934
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:03,577
am

935
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:07,199
I supposed to be building?" And
you- you don't have to build an

936
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:08,848
Electron app that analyzes what
to price your Blue Jays tickets

937
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:10,497
at [laughs],

938
00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:13,198
but like find that thing that's
meaningful, and then go for

939
00:34:13,198 --> 00:34:15,418
that,

940
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,233
and- and see where that takes
you, and who notices you based

941
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:19,048
on that.

942
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:21,663
Matt: Totally. And, you know, I
have a- a friend -- I've- I've

943
00:34:21,663 --> 00:34:23,178
had

944
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:26,208
these experiences where I, you
know, while I was at the

945
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:27,513
college, Bekah and Dan, I, you
know, I connected with this

946
00:34:27,513 --> 00:34:28,818
group

947
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:30,768
called Hacker Paradise that
facilitates these remote sort of

948
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,718
work

949
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,518
experiences. And they were, you
know, it turns out that was

950
00:34:34,518 --> 00:34:36,317
really impactful

951
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:38,613
for me. And there's a- a- a
woman I met there who is

952
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:40,877
amazing.

953
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,858
Her name is Nicole Keller, and
she has had this really, really

954
00:34:42,858 --> 00:34:44,838
cool

955
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:47,028
career path. But one of the
things she was doing down in New

956
00:34:47,028 --> 00:34:48,843
York was, running coding classes
for kids. And the thing that I

957
00:34:48,843 --> 00:34:50,658
--

958
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,893
I brought to visit. Pam and I
had gone to New York and, you

959
00:34:52,893 --> 00:34:54,497
know, called up

960
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:55,458
Nicole, and then like, "Hey,"
and she just like, "Oh, yeah.

961
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:56,388
I'm working.

962
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,393
I'm doing this coding class for
kids." And I'm like, "Can we

963
00:34:57,393 --> 00:34:58,397
come see?

964
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:00,264
That sounds awesome." And we
went in, and it was like the

965
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,639
attic of this

966
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:04,186
church. Like, you know, in- in,
like, mainland, New York. And we

967
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,733
-- so I'm

968
00:35:06,793 --> 00:35:08,008
just going to say mainland New
York. New York island. What is

969
00:35:08,008 --> 00:35:09,223
--

970
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:10,112
what are you guys call it
[laughs]? What ... Manhattan!

971
00:35:10,112 --> 00:35:11,000
That's it!

972
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Dan: Manhattan. Yes [Dan and
Bekah laugh].

973
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,082
Matt: Yeah. Manhattan. And we
[laughs] -- and it was, but,

974
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:18,164
like, the thing I

975
00:35:18,164 --> 00:35:19,619
loved, Bekah, was that they
started the kids who were --

976
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,074
like,

977
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:22,018
they were just building static
sites, and they use like a

978
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:22,933
website

979
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:25,603
builder. They were like as young
as like eight, nine years old,

980
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:28,043
but they started them with --
they had gone to the UN's ...

981
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,152
and

982
00:35:30,153 --> 00:35:32,074
I forget what it's called, but
like, basically these are like

983
00:35:32,074 --> 00:35:33,604
our principles, and they had
asked the kids, like, "What's

984
00:35:33,604 --> 00:35:35,134
one thing

985
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:37,324
that you'd wanna affect change
with, and let's build a website

986
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:39,094
to do that." Like, they- they
started -- they didn't start

987
00:35:39,094 --> 00:35:40,864
with

988
00:35:40,923 --> 00:35:44,014
teaching JavaScript or teaching
HTML, and CSS. They started with

989
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:45,000
like, what's the change you
wanna see in the world?

990
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

991
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,366
Matt: And how can we use these
amazing tools to do this? And I

992
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:50,732
think that for people

993
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,793
who are getting into tech, you
know, it's -- and there's a lot

994
00:35:52,793 --> 00:35:54,853
of

995
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,278
people that are coming in for
many, many reasons into tech.

996
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:57,703
And

997
00:35:57,704 --> 00:35:59,083
especially now. It's like -- I
think people are realizing that

998
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,462
you can

999
00:36:00,463 --> 00:36:02,353
have this great lifestyle with
it, which is wonderful. And

1000
00:36:02,353 --> 00:36:03,628
that's a great reason to come
into tech. There- there's these

1001
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:04,903
other

1002
00:36:04,903 --> 00:36:07,844
things that are connected to it.
I- I think one thing I'd love to

1003
00:36:07,844 --> 00:36:10,618
introduce to that sort of, you
know, thought processes, that

1004
00:36:10,618 --> 00:36:13,392
this is a tremendously

1005
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:15,685
powerful thing. You can make
computers do stuff

1006
00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:17,977
automatically, and that's

1007
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:20,168
awesome. And it can really
affect positive change on the

1008
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:21,938
world. And

1009
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:23,423
so, you know, as you're figuring
out what your learning projects

1010
00:36:23,423 --> 00:36:24,908
are,

1011
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,083
think about what you -- like,
what you wanna change about the

1012
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,357
world. Like,

1013
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:30,038
you- you know, can you make
something for your f- your

1014
00:36:30,038 --> 00:36:31,718
friend group? Can

1015
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,608
you make something for yourself?
Can you automate something that

1016
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,123
you're doing regularly? Can you
make something that would be

1017
00:36:35,123 --> 00:36:36,638
just

1018
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:38,484
really funny or cool, you know?
Like- like, what do you wanna

1019
00:36:38,484 --> 00:36:40,329
make?

1020
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:43,748
And- and I think if you start
with that, like, that can be

1021
00:36:43,748 --> 00:36:45,976
really powerful. Because, you-
you know, if- if you're

1022
00:36:45,976 --> 00:36:48,204
self-taught, one of

1023
00:36:48,204 --> 00:36:49,853
the biggest challenges you're
gonna face, and one of the

1024
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:51,953
biggest challenges I faced is
how do you do it regularly?

1025
00:36:51,953 --> 00:36:54,053
There

1026
00:36:54,054 --> 00:36:56,199
would be weeks I, you know,
couldn't bring myself to have

1027
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:58,344
the energy to code at

1028
00:36:58,344 --> 00:37:00,773
like 9 o'clock at night, right?
And- and to continue that

1029
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:03,983
learning -- learning is so hard.
And it's such an emotionally

1030
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:08,003
challenging journey too. But if
you're connected to something

1031
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:09,548
that you just wanna see out
there, that- that's a deeper

1032
00:37:09,548 --> 00:37:11,093
level

1033
00:37:11,094 --> 00:37:12,909
of motivation than, you know,
than somebody on one side [??]

1034
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:14,724
can be out

1035
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:17,304
there. I think that's powerful.

1036
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Bekah: Yeah.

1037
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,968
Dan: Yeah. I- I- I love that a-
a lot. And, you know, and this

1038
00:37:20,968 --> 00:37:23,817
is -- we actually -- we

1039
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:26,789
just released Roger's episode.
We talked to him a couple of

1040
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:29,073
weeks ago, and- and he- he said
a lot of the same things. He- he

1041
00:37:29,073 --> 00:37:31,357
has

1042
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:33,128
sort of a -- I mean, not the
exact path, but like

1043
00:37:33,128 --> 00:37:34,898
self-taught,

1044
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:36,399
and- and solving his own
problems, sort of thing, to

1045
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:37,869
learn

1046
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:41,559
coding. And so, I was -- I'm on
the same boat too. I think my

1047
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,139
first website ... well, that
wasn't like a GeoCities site, it

1048
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:46,719
was like my --

1049
00:37:46,949 --> 00:37:49,119
site for my band, right? It was
like in Flash or whatever.

1050
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:49,989
Matt: That's awesome.

1051
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:53,453
Dan: Just the -- yeah
[chuckles]. I mean, it's fine.

1052
00:37:53,453 --> 00:37:56,917
But, the- the -- we --

1053
00:37:57,429 --> 00:37:58,929
nowadays there's so many
learning, like, opportunities,

1054
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:00,429
or the bootcamps,

1055
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:02,768
and everything like that. And
there's so much -- so many

1056
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:04,393
different choices to- to make,
so many different paths you can

1057
00:38:04,393 --> 00:38:06,008
take. And

1058
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,348
I -- it -- when- when I came up,
it's -- there was nothing, you

1059
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:10,178
know, nothing

1060
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:13,298
like that at all. There was some
books that were out of date as

1061
00:38:13,298 --> 00:38:14,603
soon as they hit the shelves,
and, you know, and then the

1062
00:38:14,603 --> 00:38:15,908
internet,

1063
00:38:15,938 --> 00:38:18,173
right, and blogs, and- and
things like that. But, I found

1064
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:20,408
success the

1065
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:25,043
same- the same way it was. Doing
things that like were either

1066
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:27,023
fun, or, like, I wanted to fix,
right? And you were tell the

1067
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:29,003
story --

1068
00:38:29,063 --> 00:38:32,123
w- when you were talking about
the- the automated spreadsheet,

1069
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:34,118
the thing that, you know, there-
there -- I was thinking in my

1070
00:38:34,118 --> 00:38:36,113
head, this -- it's

1071
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,199
like a- a curse and a blessing
of- of people who learn program-

1072
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,284
like,

1073
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,363
once you start down the path,
like, once you've figured out

1074
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:42,442
some

1075
00:38:42,443 --> 00:38:44,408
stuff is that you start seeing
this everywhere. Like, "Oh my

1076
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:46,373
god, that --

1077
00:38:46,403 --> 00:38:49,238
I could make this easier
[chuckles]," right? And it's

1078
00:38:49,238 --> 00:38:52,073
like -- and it's- and it's --
when you do it,

1079
00:38:52,074 --> 00:38:53,903
it's like a blessing, right? But
it's, obviously, I have this --

1080
00:38:53,903 --> 00:38:55,732
for me

1081
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,473
anyway, I don't -- maybe this
isn't for everybody. But it-

1082
00:38:57,473 --> 00:38:59,213
it's like [chuckles], I start to
think about it

1083
00:38:59,244 --> 00:39:00,923
all the time, for everything.
And sometimes it gets out of

1084
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:02,602
hand,

1085
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:04,419
sometimes [laughs] I'm
automating things that don't

1086
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:06,204
actually take me that

1087
00:39:06,204 --> 00:39:07,619
long, probably. It -- probably
the work is taking longer than

1088
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,034
it

1089
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:14,784
did, but, you know, it's- it's
... I don't know. It's such

1090
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:15,879
a -- once you get into that
habit of thinking that way, and

1091
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:16,974
like --

1092
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:19,663
and the making things, it's --
it can be such -- it can- it can

1093
00:39:19,663 --> 00:39:22,283
improve your life. And like you
say,

1094
00:39:22,284 --> 00:39:24,939
you can improve- you can improve
little annoying things, or

1095
00:39:24,939 --> 00:39:27,594
little things, you know, like

1096
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:29,004
small things with your family,
or your friends, or, you know,

1097
00:39:29,004 --> 00:39:30,414
large

1098
00:39:30,443 --> 00:39:31,748
changes too. And it- it's- it's
cool. Well, there's so many

1099
00:39:31,748 --> 00:39:33,053
apps, so

1100
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:33,864
many possibilities out there.

1101
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:36,659
Matt: I mean, are there- are
there any other projects that

1102
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:40,183
you've done, Dan, that are, you
know, particularly redundant, or

1103
00:39:40,183 --> 00:39:43,707
[chuckles] maybe like, not the

1104
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,124
most, you know, effective use of
time, or any -- do you

1105
00:39:46,124 --> 00:39:47,009
[unintelligible] --

1106
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,133
Dan: Oh, well, I -- how many
color lights case here behind

1107
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:49,227
me? [Dan chuckles, Bekah
laughs].

1108
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,478
Matt: [Laughs] Quite a few
actually.

1109
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:54,013
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Back in-
back in -- I was -- every time

1110
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:56,068
we start -- like, there was a
two months or

1111
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:57,598
something where I -- so these
are all like hue light bulbs,

1112
00:39:57,598 --> 00:39:59,128
and there's-

1113
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,278
there's one you can't see too.
And I've spent so much time --

1114
00:40:01,278 --> 00:40:03,368
cuz I

1115
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:06,039
hated the lights in here. I had
-- before these, I just had, like,

1116
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:10,148
lights. Like, lamps. Everywhere.
And never could get the lighting

1117
00:40:10,148 --> 00:40:11,798
right. And then I got these, you
know, so I have -- now I got

1118
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:13,448
these

1119
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:15,849
hue, I'm like, "This is the
perfect solution. Hue bulbs. Cuz

1120
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:17,739
you can connect, you know, you
can connect them with your phone

1121
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:19,794
or your, you know, there's
probably a- a web, or a Mac app,

1122
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:21,849
and

1123
00:40:21,909 --> 00:40:23,709
all that stuff." A-a-and so I
replaced all of [chuckles] the

1124
00:40:23,709 --> 00:40:25,509
bulbs with these

1125
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:27,024
things. And now- now there's too
many op- like, now it's like

1126
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,539
[Dan and Bekah chuckle]

1127
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:29,948
there's too much to do. Like, I
can -- I have too many options.

1128
00:40:29,948 --> 00:40:31,297
There's too many

1129
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:33,083
colors, too many, like, ways. I
can turn them up and down. And

1130
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:34,868
also,

1131
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:37,006
I -- and I kinda -- exactly how
I wanted it. But then, it was

1132
00:40:37,006 --> 00:40:38,994
like, okay. Well,

1133
00:40:38,994 --> 00:40:40,839
it's still a pain for me to, like,
open my phone, and like, to push

1134
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:42,684
the

1135
00:40:42,684 --> 00:40:44,678
button, you know [chuckles]? So
it's like, time to these --

1136
00:40:44,678 --> 00:40:46,672
like, time for automations. I

1137
00:40:46,673 --> 00:40:48,428
finally bought -- oh, you can't
see it, but I bought -- so, hue

1138
00:40:48,428 --> 00:40:50,183
has

1139
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:52,073
this, like a button that you --
it is just like a little- a

1140
00:40:52,073 --> 00:40:53,962
little

1141
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:56,393
click button. And you can put it
on the wall, or you can put it

1142
00:40:56,393 --> 00:40:57,833
wherever, and you can set that
to do whatever you want, when

1143
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:59,273
you

1144
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:00,000
click it different ways
[laughs].

1145
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Matt: Cool.

1146
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,832
Dan: So I have that on my wall
now. So I -- yeah. I- I spent

1147
00:41:04,832 --> 00:41:08,664
like five days of- of being
happy. I'm- I'm like,

1148
00:41:08,664 --> 00:41:09,998
"Huh? This is- this is it. I
have it." And like, just this

1149
00:41:09,998 --> 00:41:11,332
morning, I

1150
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:13,338
sat down, and I'm like, "I
should change the colors of

1151
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:15,343
these lights- these lights [all
laughs] right now, but --"

1152
00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:22,103
So it was -- I sometimes
struggle with being satisfied

1153
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:24,068
with- with things. But, I still
-- it is -- it's also fun

1154
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:26,033
though, you

1155
00:41:26,034 --> 00:41:26,213
know [all laughs]?

1156
00:41:28,364 --> 00:41:30,659
Matt: Man, it -- the -- Bekah,
you, like, you have a -- and,

1157
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:32,954
you know, Virtual Coffee, I
think

1158
00:41:32,954 --> 00:41:35,864
it would be totally fair to call
that like a- like an amazing

1159
00:41:35,864 --> 00:41:37,844
project that both of you have
created. It's the community I

1160
00:41:37,844 --> 00:41:40,048
love and love being part of. And
so, like, does that -- is it

1161
00:41:40,048 --> 00:41:42,252
sort

1162
00:41:42,253 --> 00:41:43,503
of -- the same sort of thing
that has happened with you,

1163
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:44,753
Bekah,

1164
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:45,948
where you've had these things
that you've taken on, and you've

1165
00:41:45,948 --> 00:41:47,143
made, and

1166
00:41:47,954 --> 00:41:50,324
resulted in these learning
experiences? And I'd imagine

1167
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:51,373
Virtual Coffee has been an
amazing learning experience.

1168
00:41:51,373 --> 00:41:52,422
Even for yourself [??].

1169
00:41:52,628 --> 00:41:54,443
Bekah: Oh, for sure. It's been a
learning experience, and it's

1170
00:41:54,443 --> 00:41:56,258
been

1171
00:41:56,259 --> 00:42:00,489
great. I feel like I'm always
dropping things. We have the

1172
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:03,054
maintainers channel. And so you
-- there- there will be times

1173
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:05,619
where

1174
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:09,009
I just, like, drop a bunch of
different ideas. Like, these are

1175
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:10,598
all things that I think we
should be doing. And a lot of

1176
00:42:10,598 --> 00:42:12,187
times,

1177
00:42:12,188 --> 00:42:14,723
like, I'm writing out all of the
processes, or what this means,

1178
00:42:14,723 --> 00:42:17,258
or what

1179
00:42:17,259 --> 00:42:20,829
support we need. And then,
obviously, we don't do all of

1180
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:23,109
those because there's only 24
hours in a day [laughs], and

1181
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:25,389
it's just not

1182
00:42:25,389 --> 00:42:27,113
possible. But -- and that was
like, I- I got four hours of

1183
00:42:27,113 --> 00:42:28,837
sleep last

1184
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,848
night. And it was because last
night before bed, I- I was

1185
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,858
having this

1186
00:42:32,858 --> 00:42:35,243
idea about a tech summit that I
wanted to be doing. And I was

1187
00:42:35,243 --> 00:42:37,628
like

1188
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:39,788
messaging Kirk and Nick Taylor
about that. Like, "Hey, is this

1189
00:42:39,788 --> 00:42:41,917
a-

1190
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:45,579
is this a idea that's too out
there? Or is this something that

1191
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:48,461
maybe is useful, or good, or
worth, like, talking about?" And

1192
00:42:48,461 --> 00:42:51,343
then I fell

1193
00:42:51,344 --> 00:42:53,008
asleep. And then, it was like
three in the morning, I woke up,

1194
00:42:53,008 --> 00:42:54,672
and my

1195
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:55,828
brain was like, "All right.
Yeah. Let's- let's figure this

1196
00:42:55,828 --> 00:42:56,983
out

1197
00:42:56,983 --> 00:43:00,568
right now [laughs]," like, no.
But I feel like, you know, it's

1198
00:43:00,568 --> 00:43:04,153
a lot of

1199
00:43:04,153 --> 00:43:06,148
that, but learning has been
really great. And now I feel

1200
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:08,143
like

1201
00:43:08,143 --> 00:43:09,973
I'm going down this -- I- I
don't like Notion, I have not

1202
00:43:09,973 --> 00:43:11,803
liked it

1203
00:43:11,804 --> 00:43:14,241
anytime I've used it, but like
my methods of storing all of

1204
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:16,678
these

1205
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:21,628
ideas and writing about them is
just unsatisfactory now. And so

1206
00:43:21,628 --> 00:43:23,488
I've started going down the
Notion rabbit hole of like,

1207
00:43:23,488 --> 00:43:25,348
"This

1208
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:28,349
is- this is what I need to do.
And I need to automate these

1209
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:30,899
things to my Notion, because I
know that I can." So, I feel

1210
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:33,449
like you

1211
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:35,863
could probably automate like hi-
what your lights look like

1212
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,277
through Notion,

1213
00:43:38,518 --> 00:43:41,818
right? If you just select what
mood you're in, and then it will

1214
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:43,406
automatically set your lights.
So, Dan, you should try that

1215
00:43:43,406 --> 00:43:44,994
[chuckles].

1216
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:46,839
Dan: Yeah. Last time I messed
with Notion, I had like a

1217
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:47,829
nervous

1218
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:49,208
breakdown trying to get
everything exactly like

1219
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:50,587
[chuckles] --

1220
00:43:51,224 --> 00:43:52,603
Bekah: Kirk is making me a
template. So [chuckles] --

1221
00:43:53,753 --> 00:43:55,583
Dan: Yeah. That's the- that's
the issue I have with Notion is-

1222
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,413
is -- it's

1223
00:43:57,414 --> 00:43:59,664
a great product and it's a very,
very cool initiative. There's

1224
00:43:59,664 --> 00:44:02,423
just too many possibilities, and
it's too pop- it's like possible

1225
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:04,838
to get it -- it seems possible
to get it perfect [chuckles].

1226
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:07,253
And it's like,

1227
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:09,143
when that- when that, like,
perfect thing gets in my head,

1228
00:44:09,143 --> 00:44:11,033
it's hard to --

1229
00:44:11,094 --> 00:44:12,233
sometimes hard to let it go. So
[chuckles] --

1230
00:44:13,409 --> 00:44:14,849
Matt: Yeah. We- we've spent a
lot of time in Notion too. We,

1231
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:16,289
you

1232
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:17,758
know, it's ... things that are
highly customizable are often

1233
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:19,227
not the

1234
00:44:19,228 --> 00:44:20,369
best tools, right? Like, it's,

1235
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:23,248
you know, I appreciate software
that has opinion

1236
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:23,668
sometimes.

1237
00:44:23,668 --> 00:44:25,000
Bekah: I say that --

1238
00:44:23,668 --> 00:44:25,000
Dan: Yeah. My- my -- oh, go
ahead, Bekah.

1239
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:29,588
Bekah: It -- my -- right now,
I've just collected way too many

1240
00:44:29,588 --> 00:44:33,969
different ways of doing things.
Like, you know, I've got all

1241
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:36,383
these apps to help me with
planning or note taking or,

1242
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:38,797
you

1243
00:44:38,798 --> 00:44:40,628
know, whatev- there's just way
too many of them. So I feel like

1244
00:44:40,628 --> 00:44:42,458
I'm

1245
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:45,848
just very ... all or nothing
kind of person. And so

1246
00:44:45,848 --> 00:44:49,238
[chuckles] I- I can't have all
of

1247
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:52,653
these. Now I just need one
thing, and Notion is the- the

1248
00:44:52,653 --> 00:44:56,067
one thing to rule them all up,

1249
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:56,619
apparently.

1250
00:44:58,353 --> 00:44:59,778
Matt: [Chuckles] And so then,
you know, in -- circling back,

1251
00:44:59,778 --> 00:45:01,203
like, Bekah, you

1252
00:45:01,204 --> 00:45:03,363
have this awesome job. You're an
amazing community manager. Did

1253
00:45:03,363 --> 00:45:05,522
you have

1254
00:45:05,523 --> 00:45:06,963
those skills before you started
the Virtual Coffee or was that

1255
00:45:06,963 --> 00:45:08,403
something that you

1256
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,364
learned and kind of just figured
out, go into the process?

1257
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:15,113
Bekah: When I- when I was in
undergrad, I- I graduated in

1258
00:45:15,113 --> 00:45:17,033
three

1259
00:45:17,034 --> 00:45:19,764
years. So I took a bunch of
credits, but I was also in 10

1260
00:45:19,764 --> 00:45:22,328
clubs, and I was an officer in
like five of them [chuckles].

1261
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:24,892
So, I- I feel like

1262
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:29,664
it's been a lifelong journey of
community building, and many

1263
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:32,353
points where I've tried to
reject that. Like, please let me

1264
00:45:32,353 --> 00:45:35,042
just be in

1265
00:45:35,043 --> 00:45:36,948
a hole by myself [chuckles] and
not talk to people. But I keep

1266
00:45:36,948 --> 00:45:38,853
coming

1267
00:45:38,853 --> 00:45:40,233
back to it. I feel like I
finally hit the point where I'm

1268
00:45:40,233 --> 00:45:41,613
like, "Okay,"

1269
00:45:42,454 --> 00:45:45,153
like, "This- this is a skill set
I should utilize it and- and

1270
00:45:45,153 --> 00:45:47,852
figure out

1271
00:45:47,853 --> 00:45:51,603
how I can best do that thing."
So, yeah. It's- it's ... I guess

1272
00:45:51,603 --> 00:45:55,353
part of

1273
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:55,744
me.

1274
00:45:57,074 --> 00:45:58,653
Matt: That's really cool. I, you
know, I think that, like, one of

1275
00:45:58,653 --> 00:46:00,232
the

1276
00:46:00,233 --> 00:46:05,143
things that, you know, I was
hard to figure out, and I'm- I'm

1277
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:07,373
hope I think it's okay. I'm kind
of like left turning the

1278
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:08,303
conversation a little bit. One
of the things that was really

1279
00:46:08,303 --> 00:46:09,233
hard

1280
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,423
to figure out in- in running a
business is like, how do you

1281
00:46:11,423 --> 00:46:14,873
hire? And you need to figure it
all out from scratch. Because,

1282
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:16,238
like, we had hired a bunch of
people that make stuff at IBM,

1283
00:46:16,238 --> 00:46:17,603
but

1284
00:46:17,603 --> 00:46:19,554
it was all a very catered
experience. Like, we had -- we

1285
00:46:19,554 --> 00:46:22,028
outsourced all of the hard out
of front work [??]. And we got

1286
00:46:22,028 --> 00:46:24,502
these, like, just like 50

1287
00:46:24,503 --> 00:46:25,763
incredible candidates, and we
would divide them up on our

1288
00:46:25,763 --> 00:46:27,023
team,

1289
00:46:27,023 --> 00:46:27,998
and figure out who's gonna do
round one, round two, round

1290
00:46:27,998 --> 00:46:28,973
three,

1291
00:46:29,063 --> 00:46:32,873
right? And that like,
interviewing is easy, but hiring

1292
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,273
is hard. And hiring is all that
other stuff. It's like finding

1293
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:37,793
people and evaluating them. And-
and then, you know, you read

1294
00:46:37,793 --> 00:46:38,828
about all the bad things that
happen to hiring process, and

1295
00:46:38,828 --> 00:46:39,863
you

1296
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:41,514
don't wanna do those, and you
wanna do the good things, and

1297
00:46:41,514 --> 00:46:43,284
you wanna get the right person,
and then the right people. The

1298
00:46:43,284 --> 00:46:45,054
thing

1299
00:46:45,054 --> 00:46:46,683
that has always stand out to me
is personal projects. And it's-

1300
00:46:46,683 --> 00:46:48,312
it's

1301
00:46:48,414 --> 00:46:49,613
probably not surprising given
the history I just described,

1302
00:46:49,613 --> 00:46:50,812
right?

1303
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:52,358
Like, I -- like, I value them a
lot. But I think that when

1304
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:53,872
somebody

1305
00:46:53,873 --> 00:46:55,628
comes in, and they say, "Hey, I
made this thing, and here is why

1306
00:46:55,628 --> 00:46:57,383
I made it,

1307
00:46:57,384 --> 00:46:59,169
and here's -- like, how it's
important for, like, small

1308
00:46:59,169 --> 00:47:00,954
businesses,

1309
00:47:00,954 --> 00:47:03,691
especially," that is so helpful
because it's like, the person's

1310
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:06,428
thinking

1311
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:08,288
about a need on the other side
of what they're doing. And like,

1312
00:47:08,288 --> 00:47:10,147
you

1313
00:47:10,148 --> 00:47:12,068
know, it- it's -- we don't have,
like, tickets where we're working

1314
00:47:12,068 --> 00:47:13,988
through.

1315
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:17,079
We're too small. We, you know,
we don't have a ton of process

1316
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:18,893
around things. But, like, when
people come in, and then I

1317
00:47:18,893 --> 00:47:20,707
imagine this is the

1318
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:22,598
case for you, Bekah, and you do
this amazing community

1319
00:47:22,598 --> 00:47:24,488
management, and

1320
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:26,364
all this other stuff. And you
have Virtual Coffee as this

1321
00:47:26,364 --> 00:47:28,239
incredible example

1322
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:31,006
of you doing that, in tech, at
scale. And- and I just -- that's

1323
00:47:31,006 --> 00:47:33,773
awesome.

1324
00:47:34,324 --> 00:47:36,753
Bekah: Yeah. I -- and that's
what led to the job that I have

1325
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:41,193
right now. I wasn't looking for
work. My team lead reached

1326
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:43,143
out to me, and it was based on
Virtual Coffee. And somebody

1327
00:47:43,143 --> 00:47:45,093
else

1328
00:47:45,094 --> 00:47:48,543
had — who I'd interviewed with,
who had reached out to me

1329
00:47:48,903 --> 00:47:53,333
last summer ... because they
knew about Virtual Coffee —

1330
00:47:53,364 --> 00:47:55,689
recommended me. Like, I was on
the top of the -- their list.

1331
00:47:55,689 --> 00:47:58,014
And so, once he

1332
00:47:58,014 --> 00:48:01,494
started looking into Virtual
Coffee — I think he watched

1333
00:48:01,523 --> 00:48:03,083
some of our Lunch and Learn
videos and read blog posts —

1334
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:04,643
like,

1335
00:48:04,643 --> 00:48:10,134
there- there is a -- my
community building resume is out

1336
00:48:10,134 --> 00:48:15,474
there because of all of the
things that we do. And so, yeah.

1337
00:48:15,543 --> 00:48:17,158
It is. It is like a project. I
hadn't really thought about it

1338
00:48:17,158 --> 00:48:18,773
that way,

1339
00:48:18,773 --> 00:48:20,978
but it is this- this living
resume of all of the things that

1340
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:23,183
I've

1341
00:48:23,184 --> 00:48:23,934
been working on.

1342
00:48:24,923 --> 00:48:26,453
Matt: Totally. And- and Dan,
watch out. Cuz, like, Phillips

1343
00:48:26,453 --> 00:48:27,983
is gonna come

1344
00:48:27,983 --> 00:48:29,693
knocking, and gonna say, "Hey,
[Dan and Bekah laugh] I heard

1345
00:48:29,693 --> 00:48:31,403
all these things you're doing
with our light bulbs [laughs]."

1346
00:48:33,134 --> 00:48:34,123
Dan: Yeah.

1347
00:48:34,793 --> 00:48:35,423
Matt: I'm, like, the CTO.
[Unintelligible] you [laughs].

1348
00:48:35,594 --> 00:48:37,294
Dan: And they gonna come, and
say, "Hey, buy this product

1349
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:38,994
[laughs]. This

1350
00:48:38,994 --> 00:48:41,094
product will finally solve all
of your problems."

1351
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:43,613
Matt: [Chuckles] Oh my god.
Yeah. I hope all the -- our

1352
00:48:43,613 --> 00:48:44,678
conversation in this podcast

1353
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,378
has an index cuz it'll go to
these Google searches. I mean,

1354
00:48:47,378 --> 00:48:49,539
this is gonna be all Philips hue
light bulbs.

1355
00:48:49,539 --> 00:48:50,543
Dan: [Laughs] Right.

1356
00:48:50,543 --> 00:48:52,574
Bekah: But we are open for
sponsorships, so --

1357
00:48:54,423 --> 00:48:54,844
Dan: Yeah. That's right.

1358
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,113
Matt: [Unintelligible] Oh my
gosh. Yeah. It's -- that's

1359
00:48:57,113 --> 00:48:58,627
really interesting. I

1360
00:48:58,628 --> 00:49:01,208
think the -- those personal
projects, they- they really

1361
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:03,788
standout. And, you

1362
00:49:03,789 --> 00:49:06,219
know, and certainly there's
merit if you're going to a

1363
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:07,598
bootcamp, and going through that,
you -- like, you wanna stay on

1364
00:49:07,598 --> 00:49:08,977
task,

1365
00:49:08,978 --> 00:49:10,313
right? And if you're gonna get
great learning, great feedback

1366
00:49:10,313 --> 00:49:11,648
by

1367
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:12,638
building something that it --
like the bootcamp is saying,

1368
00:49:12,638 --> 00:49:13,628
"Oh, we're

1369
00:49:13,628 --> 00:49:15,443
gonna build like a, you know,
shopping cart," that's totally

1370
00:49:15,443 --> 00:49:17,258
cool, right? But

1371
00:49:17,259 --> 00:49:19,509
those- those other pieces of
like, "Hey, I've got this skill

1372
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:21,751
sat down. I can use it to just
really do anything I want," it-

1373
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:23,993
it is just so

1374
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,153
attractive to me in a hiring
process. Like, it really

1375
00:49:26,153 --> 00:49:28,312
separates

1376
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:31,373
people out. And I'd imagine
that's been the experience for

1377
00:49:31,373 --> 00:49:33,143
both of you from what you've
described too.

1378
00:49:33,893 --> 00:49:35,528
Dan: Yeah. And- and like, if you
are -- if your only project is

1379
00:49:35,528 --> 00:49:37,163
coming out of

1380
00:49:37,164 --> 00:49:39,188
a bootcamp or what you did in
the bootcamp, and everybody else

1381
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:41,212
is trying

1382
00:49:41,213 --> 00:49:43,344
to get a job too, you know,
everybody is going to have the

1383
00:49:43,344 --> 00:49:46,043
same set of projects, right? And
so, that's- that's another thing

1384
00:49:46,074 --> 00:49:47,679
is doing those. And maybe it's
-- maybe there's not enough time

1385
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:49,284
to

1386
00:49:49,284 --> 00:49:50,379
do it while you're in the
bootcamp, you know? Maybe kind

1387
00:49:50,379 --> 00:49:51,474
of

1388
00:49:51,563 --> 00:49:55,853
do it after, but the -- those
personal projects, I- I totally

1389
00:49:55,853 --> 00:49:58,643
agree with you, Matt. It- it- it
says- it says so much about ...

1390
00:49:58,643 --> 00:50:01,433
you,

1391
00:50:01,434 --> 00:50:02,694
without even speaking
[chuckles]. And then it also

1392
00:50:02,694 --> 00:50:03,954
gives you something to

1393
00:50:03,954 --> 00:50:04,164
talk about, that's easy

1394
00:50:04,164 --> 00:50:06,983
to talk about because you did
it, and you know- and you

1395
00:50:06,983 --> 00:50:09,548
know it. So it's not a
theoretical thing or, you know,

1396
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:12,113
school assignment that

1397
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:13,688
you weren't connected with, you
know? And it -- and again, it

1398
00:50:13,688 --> 00:50:15,233
doesn't

1399
00:50:15,233 --> 00:50:17,858
have to be world changing or a
successful product or anything

1400
00:50:17,858 --> 00:50:20,483
like that,

1401
00:50:20,483 --> 00:50:23,094
right? You- you were talking
about that Chrome extension that

1402
00:50:23,094 --> 00:50:24,308
you made. That's literally just
you and your wife [chuckles],

1403
00:50:24,308 --> 00:50:25,522
right?

1404
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:26,454
Matt: Yeah.

1405
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:27,953
Dan: And that- and that's it.
Like, but it -- that's- that's-

1406
00:50:27,953 --> 00:50:29,272
that's a cool project. And I

1407
00:50:29,273 --> 00:50:30,398
would like -- like, I enjoyed
hearing about it, and I would,

1408
00:50:30,398 --> 00:50:31,523
if

1409
00:50:31,523 --> 00:50:34,344
I was hiring, I would also enjoy
hearing about it. Don't -- you

1410
00:50:34,344 --> 00:50:35,798
know, you didn't, like, sell it
to somebody, or, you know, it

1411
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:37,252
doesn't have to

1412
00:50:37,253 --> 00:50:37,643
be some, I don't know,

1413
00:50:38,914 --> 00:50:42,264
huge thing. It's- it's just a- a
thing that you

1414
00:50:42,264 --> 00:50:43,583
decided to do on your own, and-
and you figured out how to do

1415
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,902
it. And

1416
00:50:44,903 --> 00:50:45,713
that's- that's the cool part for
me.

1417
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:51,309
Bekah: We just wrapped up a
hackathon at Deepgram. And one

1418
00:50:51,338 --> 00:50:53,438
of our participants had, I
think, five submissions. And

1419
00:50:53,438 --> 00:50:55,538
this is a month

1420
00:50:55,539 --> 00:50:58,238
long hackathon. And the
submissions were all

1421
00:50:58,238 --> 00:51:00,937
interesting, and they

1422
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:04,659
were all beautiful. The design
was really great. I'm really

1423
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:06,474
terrible at design. And the- the
fact that all of these looked

1424
00:51:06,474 --> 00:51:08,289
really

1425
00:51:08,289 --> 00:51:12,159
wonderful were meaningful, and
interesting projects was great.

1426
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:16,268
But I interviewed that
participant for a blog post

1427
00:51:16,268 --> 00:51:19,253
highlight. And being able to
hear the stories behind it, to

1428
00:51:19,253 --> 00:51:22,238
hear how he

1429
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,304
communicated, what he did, his
approach, how he did it, I --

1430
00:51:25,304 --> 00:51:28,369
that's -- he's a

1431
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:30,169
person in the top of my book
that I would recommend for a

1432
00:51:30,169 --> 00:51:31,969
job.

1433
00:51:31,998 --> 00:51:33,738
But I know that he's looking,
and he's going to be more

1434
00:51:33,738 --> 00:51:35,478
actively

1435
00:51:35,478 --> 00:51:38,223
looking soon. And so when
anything comes up, I know that

1436
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:40,968
I'm going

1437
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:42,828
to reach out to that person. So,
you know, if it doesn't catch

1438
00:51:42,828 --> 00:51:44,687
the eye

1439
00:51:44,748 --> 00:51:46,009
of somebody who's doing the
hiring,

1440
00:51:46,009 --> 00:51:47,973
it might catch the eye of
somebody who's in a position

1441
00:51:47,973 --> 00:51:49,937
where people

1442
00:51:49,938 --> 00:51:51,693
reach out to them and say, "Hey,
do you know anybody?" Like,

1443
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:53,448
"Yes, I

1444
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:55,938
do. This person would be really,
really great for this role."

1445
00:51:57,963 --> 00:51:59,328
Matt: Yeah, that's- that's
really interesting. And, you

1446
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:00,693
know, and

1447
00:52:00,693 --> 00:52:03,603
another sort of related thing
that I hear a lot of hiring

1448
00:52:03,603 --> 00:52:06,333
managers articulate, and there's
famous examples of this, too, is-

1449
00:52:06,753 --> 00:52:08,690
is like a really strong
indicator of success in a

1450
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:10,627
businesses or in a

1451
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,413
particular role is how -- has
that person achieved a success

1452
00:52:12,413 --> 00:52:14,198
or

1453
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:18,759
excellence in a completely
different area, right? And,

1454
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,409
you know, the -- Shopify has
this famous example where their

1455
00:52:20,409 --> 00:52:21,849
CEO

1456
00:52:21,849 --> 00:52:24,429
gave an internship or a job to
someone because they are like

1457
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:27,000
ranked in the top 50 at
StarCraft, you know?

1458
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Dan: That's awesome.

1459
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,674
Matt: And there's like similar
sort of conversation in- in

1460
00:52:31,674 --> 00:52:35,348
sales, like, you know, this
other sort of area around

1461
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:38,378
people who have had a-athletic
success, you know? So there-

1462
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:39,593
there are people who are sales
managers, they were like, "Oh,

1463
00:52:39,593 --> 00:52:40,748
you

1464
00:52:40,748 --> 00:52:44,289
were division to athlete and
track?" Like, that's a really

1465
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:46,268
strong indicator for this other
type of thing. And I- I think

1466
00:52:46,268 --> 00:52:48,247
like

1467
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,703
you also see it in like
volunteers. I'm like -- the

1468
00:52:49,703 --> 00:52:51,158
stuff

1469
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:53,559
you did when we're describing in
university, Bekah. Right?

1470
00:52:54,324 --> 00:52:57,083
It's interesting, these signals.
Because the way that we

1471
00:52:57,264 --> 00:52:59,349
typically interview is like in
front of a whiteboard

1472
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:01,434
[chuckles], and we

1473
00:53:01,434 --> 00:53:03,998
just -- we know it's- it's- it's
a hard process to take on

1474
00:53:03,998 --> 00:53:06,562
anyways.

1475
00:53:07,344 --> 00:53:07,733
All- all I have to say.

1476
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:10,883
Bekah: Yeah, it is- it is really
hard. And I think, even hearing

1477
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:12,727
a lot of

1478
00:53:12,728 --> 00:53:14,813
conversations around hiring
where people are trying to do

1479
00:53:14,813 --> 00:53:16,898
things,

1480
00:53:16,929 --> 00:53:20,648
there -- there's still so much
of the process where we're stuck

1481
00:53:20,648 --> 00:53:25,098
inside this box. So, rather
than, like, really trying to ...

1482
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:29,548
rethink how we

1483
00:53:29,548 --> 00:53:32,518
do the entire process, we're
like, well, we're gonna

1484
00:53:32,518 --> 00:53:34,633
rethink, but we still have to do
all of these things. And we have

1485
00:53:34,633 --> 00:53:36,748
to

1486
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:39,148
ask these questions because you
have to [chuckles]. You- you

1487
00:53:39,148 --> 00:53:41,548
don't have to.

1488
00:53:41,548 --> 00:53:43,633
That's not -- what is that ...
indicating? And how does that

1489
00:53:43,633 --> 00:53:45,718
tell you

1490
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:48,898
whether or not that's going to
be a good person for you to work

1491
00:53:48,898 --> 00:53:51,163
with or a good team for you to
join? How do we rethink the way

1492
00:53:51,163 --> 00:53:53,428
that

1493
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:57,216
we're ... doing hiring? How
we're onboarding new people? How

1494
00:53:57,216 --> 00:54:01,003
we are

1495
00:54:01,003 --> 00:54:03,238
looking at junior developers in
this hiring process? I can't --

1496
00:54:03,238 --> 00:54:05,473
in- in

1497
00:54:05,474 --> 00:54:07,244
my mind, it has to be -- there's
a much bigger shift that needs

1498
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,014
to

1499
00:54:09,014 --> 00:54:12,643
happen than, you know, these
tiny changes that we keep seeing

1500
00:54:12,643 --> 00:54:13,244
happening.

1501
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:18,369
Matt: Yeah. I, you know, I --
there's a part of me that --

1502
00:54:18,608 --> 00:54:21,518
and I- I wanna sort of say this
in the, like, the best possible

1503
00:54:21,518 --> 00:54:24,158
way that I'm -- I- I wish that
people generally were more

1504
00:54:24,158 --> 00:54:26,798
deliberate

1505
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:28,763
about what they wanted out of a
job. And this has been something

1506
00:54:28,763 --> 00:54:30,668
that's been

1507
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:32,333
incredibly important for me.
And, you know, there's these

1508
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:33,998
books

1509
00:54:33,998 --> 00:54:36,458
that like, sort of get you
thinking on these topics, but

1510
00:54:37,224 --> 00:54:39,143
like, really early on, for me,
was it -- that- that juncture

1511
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:41,062
where I'm

1512
00:54:41,063 --> 00:54:42,713
like, oh, like, a career in tech
in- in -- specifically, there's

1513
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:44,363
a shift I

1514
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,923
had, you know, a couple of years
after learning code where I --

1515
00:54:45,923 --> 00:54:47,482
I've

1516
00:54:47,543 --> 00:54:50,634
very deliberately, I wanna run a
business. I- I wanna run a

1517
00:54:50,634 --> 00:54:53,123
technology based business. And
that wasn't for the sake of

1518
00:54:53,184 --> 00:54:55,523
wanting to do that. It was
because of these other things

1519
00:54:55,523 --> 00:54:56,783
that I wanted. I sat --
literally had a moment where I

1520
00:54:56,783 --> 00:54:58,043
sat down, and I

1521
00:54:58,043 --> 00:55:00,298
say, "What do I wanted in my
work life?" And, you know, for

1522
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:02,553
me,

1523
00:55:02,554 --> 00:55:04,744
they were things that were
connected to autonomy. I wanted,

1524
00:55:04,983 --> 00:55:06,558
like, in a perfect world, I
would work where and when I

1525
00:55:06,558 --> 00:55:08,133
wanted to.

1526
00:55:08,134 --> 00:55:09,709
I would -- like, I- I ne- was
always confused that we had this

1527
00:55:09,709 --> 00:55:11,284
like 40

1528
00:55:11,284 --> 00:55:13,034
hour a week box that we often
live in. Like, why does that-

1529
00:55:13,034 --> 00:55:14,784
why does

1530
00:55:14,784 --> 00:55:17,844
that have to exist, you know?
Like, what are the reasons that

1531
00:55:17,844 --> 00:55:19,959
the edges of that box are there?
And like, I -- what if one week

1532
00:55:19,959 --> 00:55:22,074
I

1533
00:55:22,074 --> 00:55:25,403
wanna work less? And one week I
wanted that type of control to,

1534
00:55:25,884 --> 00:55:29,483
you know, there were these -- I-
I wanted to work on any type of

1535
00:55:29,483 --> 00:55:32,693
problem that I wanted. I- I
wanted to have the potential for

1536
00:55:32,693 --> 00:55:36,293
financial independence, you
know? These types of things. And

1537
00:55:36,344 --> 00:55:40,403
that put like, you know, to me,
that was really helpful because

1538
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:41,873
it determined the types of jobs
that I wanted to work at and-

1539
00:55:41,873 --> 00:55:43,343
and why.

1540
00:55:43,824 --> 00:55:45,233
And so when I started applying
to -- and I -- like, I think I

1541
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:46,642
applied

1542
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:48,713
to, you know, putting IBM and
Microsoft aside because I- I

1543
00:55:48,713 --> 00:55:50,783
never actually put an

1544
00:55:50,784 --> 00:55:53,754
application into either company.
It -- they -- like, once you get

1545
00:55:53,754 --> 00:55:56,724
in, it -- I

1546
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:59,813
just wanna go there, but it's a
different process. And -- but

1547
00:55:59,813 --> 00:56:00,983
I did apply to two technology
companies to be a programmer.

1548
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,153
And

1549
00:56:02,244 --> 00:56:04,994
that -- my purpose in applying
to them was, you know, the- the

1550
00:56:05,003 --> 00:56:07,434
conventional wisdom that working
at a startup will help you do a

1551
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:10,434
startup later. And that's what I
wanted. I wanted to run my own

1552
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:12,713
business. So I was applying to a
very particular type of company

1553
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:16,344
because the purpose of that
learning was to help me do this

1554
00:56:16,344 --> 00:56:20,273
thing later. And, you know, the
funny thing about people who are

1555
00:56:20,304 --> 00:56:23,873
junior devel- developers and who
are graduating like in 2022,

1556
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:25,223
is in a very short period of
time, they're the hiring

1557
00:56:25,223 --> 00:56:26,153
managers.

1558
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:30,498
And, you know, I -- like, I --
my gut feeling is that if people

1559
00:56:30,498 --> 00:56:32,687
were

1560
00:56:32,688 --> 00:56:36,679
approaching that process with
like a very deliberate set of

1561
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:40,489
values and intentions, that
hiring would change on the

1562
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:44,748
back end, later. Or maybe not,
you know? [Laughs]

1563
00:56:48,969 --> 00:56:50,708
Bekah: Yeah, that's interesting.
I hadn't really thought about

1564
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:53,333
that. And it- and it can be
really hard, especially with so

1565
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:55,958
many people

1566
00:56:55,989 --> 00:56:58,268
looking for jobs on the market
right now. And -- I knew that I

1567
00:56:58,268 --> 00:57:00,547
spent a lot

1568
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:05,079
of time telling people, when you
join your first team, it should

1569
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:07,464
be about the people, and not the
project. Because I've seen so

1570
00:57:07,464 --> 00:57:09,849
many

1571
00:57:09,849 --> 00:57:11,994
people jump into, I --
particularly, EdTech companies. I

1572
00:57:11,994 --> 00:57:14,139
don't know.

1573
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:17,033
I just -- generally EdTech
that's really toxic or what, but

1574
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:19,777
just

1575
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:22,718
really bad experiences. And
there's been the whole, like,

1576
00:57:22,718 --> 00:57:25,027
mission trade-off thing.

1577
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:27,991
"Well," you know, "We've got a
great mission." Well, but you're

1578
00:57:27,991 --> 00:57:30,923
doing a

1579
00:57:30,923 --> 00:57:32,963
terrible job of managing a team,
being kind to other people

1580
00:57:32,963 --> 00:57:35,003
[chuckles], you

1581
00:57:35,003 --> 00:57:37,253
know? Like, those things matter.

1582
00:57:38,403 --> 00:57:40,548
Matt: Yeah. You know, I- I -- if
I was, you know, the key -- talk

1583
00:57:40,548 --> 00:57:42,693
about EdTech, and I

1584
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:43,893
completely echo that sentiment,
I think it's totally correct.

1585
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,093
And video-

1586
00:57:45,153 --> 00:57:46,000
video game industry is
notorious, right?

1587
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Bekah: Yeah.

1588
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,989
Matt: For -- like, it's not being
a great place to work. If there

1589
00:57:49,989 --> 00:57:53,978
was one thing that I learned
working in big tech,

1590
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:55,884
like, you know, going from a
college where you're, you know,

1591
00:57:55,884 --> 00:57:57,759
you,

1592
00:57:57,789 --> 00:58:00,398
like, you make this amount of
money, you need a $1,500 raise a

1593
00:58:00,398 --> 00:58:02,378
year, and it's unionized, and X,
and Y, and Z. And then, like, I

1594
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,358
remember

1595
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:06,734
the week that I joined IBM,
they, like, flew me down to

1596
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:09,079
Silicon Valley for two

1597
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:10,714
weeks. We had this -- then we
had, like, this event. And there

1598
00:58:10,714 --> 00:58:12,349
was like

1599
00:58:12,498 --> 00:58:14,013
this music, and it was just all
catered, and it was all free,

1600
00:58:14,013 --> 00:58:15,528
and

1601
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:18,004
it was crazy, the amount of
money. And I got the opportunity

1602
00:58:18,004 --> 00:58:19,969
to work

1603
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:22,668
with you. It was really great. I
loved both of those jobs.

1604
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:24,543
Loved, loved, loved both of
them. And I think, one of the

1605
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:26,297
things

1606
00:58:26,298 --> 00:58:29,329
that I've learned is, that a lot
of the things that we want in an

1607
00:58:29,329 --> 00:58:31,386
employer, a really, really
strong indicator is the health

1608
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:33,443
of the

1609
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:37,344
business. If you wanna- if- if
you wanna work, you know, my- my

1610
00:58:37,403 --> 00:58:39,833
wife works at Shopify. She loves
it there. And, you know, they

1611
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:42,263
have -- Shopify makes

1612
00:58:42,264 --> 00:58:43,943
so much money that they can hire
people, that all they do is

1613
00:58:43,943 --> 00:58:45,622
think

1614
00:58:45,623 --> 00:58:48,204
about diversity and equity. And
they hire another -- they have a

1615
00:58:48,204 --> 00:58:49,613
whole team that all they do is
think about culture. And they

1616
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:51,022
have

1617
00:58:51,023 --> 00:58:54,534
whole teams that do all -- do
nothing but, you know, run an

1618
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:58,509
internal events and try to make
that a great place to work, you

1619
00:58:58,509 --> 00:59:01,000
know? You can do that if you've
got a ton of money.

1620
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

1621
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,934
Matt: And, you know, in terms of
diversity in tech, my AI team at

1622
00:59:04,934 --> 00:59:07,868
Microsoft, we were

1623
00:59:08,018 --> 00:59:10,329
extremely diverse by every
standard. We had more women than

1624
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:12,788
men, and- and that's an AI where
-- like, its AI and data science

1625
00:59:12,788 --> 00:59:15,247
is enormously

1626
00:59:15,248 --> 00:59:17,378
behind computer science. It's
where computer science was like

1627
00:59:17,378 --> 00:59:19,943
15 years ago. But we were able
to have a diverse team at

1628
00:59:19,943 --> 00:59:22,508
Microsoft

1629
00:59:22,509 --> 00:59:25,193
because we could outbid
everybody, you know? We- we

1630
00:59:25,193 --> 00:59:27,877
could go hire the best, and the

1631
00:59:27,878 --> 00:59:30,098
best one are to work for us. And
we can afford it. And there's a

1632
00:59:30,098 --> 00:59:32,318
million

1633
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,493
other examples like that. So,
it's like, I think going full

1634
00:59:34,493 --> 00:59:36,668
circle,

1635
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:39,699
a lot of EdTech can be a really
tough place to work because

1636
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,000
that's a really, really hard
business to be in.

1637
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

1638
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,959
Matt: And you're- you're
pinching every corner. And

1639
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:47,918
usually, you are. And same with
the video game

1640
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:51,338
industry is, it is like, you
know, if that game does well,

1641
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:53,348
congratulations. But if it
doesn't, you -- it -- like, it's

1642
00:59:53,348 --> 00:59:55,358
really -- it's a tough

1643
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:59,043
environment to work in. So, you
know, if you wanna have a

1644
00:59:59,043 --> 01:00:01,503
really great place to work, I
think the best, most simple

1645
01:00:01,503 --> 01:00:02,913
indicator you can look at is,
like, how much money did they

1646
01:00:02,913 --> 01:00:04,323
raise in

1647
01:00:04,324 --> 01:00:05,794
the last round, if it's a
startup. If it's a publicly --

1648
01:00:05,794 --> 01:00:07,264
big

1649
01:00:07,264 --> 01:00:09,454
publicly traded company, is it
growing? Look at their stock

1650
01:00:09,454 --> 01:00:11,119
chart for five years. Does it go
up? You know, if it does,

1651
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,784
probably

1652
01:00:12,784 --> 01:00:14,478
a great place to work. If it's
flat, it- it, you know, you

1653
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:16,172
might be getting

1654
01:00:16,684 --> 01:00:17,793
like -- you might not have
budget to go to that next

1655
01:00:17,793 --> 01:00:18,902
conference.

1656
01:00:18,963 --> 01:00:20,718
It's ... you know? And
similarly, people might not be

1657
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:22,473
attracted to

1658
01:00:22,474 --> 01:00:23,164
work there, in the same.

1659
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,201
Bekah: Yeah, I think that's
great advice. I wanna thank you

1660
01:00:27,201 --> 01:00:29,601
so much for being here with us
today and having this

1661
01:00:29,601 --> 01:00:31,595
conversation. There's a lot of
really great takeaway cuz I feel

1662
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:33,589
like --

1663
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:36,860
from all these stuff that we
talked about here. Is there

1664
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:38,765
anything that you wanna share
before we leave, or any last

1665
01:00:38,765 --> 01:00:40,670
words

1666
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,050
of wisdom for our listeners?

1667
01:00:42,596 --> 01:00:44,036
Matt: No. Thanks everyone. The
-- thank you, Bekah and Dan, for

1668
01:00:44,036 --> 01:00:45,476
having me.

1669
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:46,855
It's- it's great. If nothing
else, I think one of the things

1670
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:48,234
we all

1671
01:00:48,235 --> 01:00:49,810
take away from today is build
personal projects. Go make

1672
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:51,385
stuff.

1673
01:00:51,536 --> 01:00:53,230
Like, you know, the- the old
Y-Com motto, make- make stuff

1674
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:54,924
people

1675
01:00:54,925 --> 01:00:56,396
want, right? Make stuff you
want.

1676
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Bekah: Yeah.

1677
01:00:56,501 --> 01:00:56,800
Dan: Yeah.

1678
01:00:56,846 --> 01:00:57,326
Matt: It's cool. And share it --

1679
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:58,501
Bekah: Share with us too. We
wanna see 'em.

1680
01:00:59,036 --> 01:01:00,896
Matt: Yeah, totally. Thank you
so much for having me.

1681
01:01:01,001 --> 01:01:03,000
Dan: Thanks, Matt. This is
awesome.

1682
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Bekah: Bye.
