00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:09,535
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 5 Episode 8 of

2
00:00:09,535 --> 00:00:14,811
the Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:18,711
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:21,562
is an intimate group of developers
at all stages of their

5
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:24,231
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:26,661
stories and what they've learned.
And we're here to share it with

7
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:29,262
you. Here with me today is my
co-host, Dan.

8
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:31,000
Dan Ott: Hello, Bekah.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Bekah: Hey, Dan.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,476
Dan: Today, we had [chuckles] a really- a really fun episode.
We sat down with Matt McInnis. He is a ... I don't know. A data

11
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:44,826
scientist, a full-stack engineer,
a founder, used to be a math

12
00:00:44,826 --> 00:00:48,216
professor. He- he had a real --
he has had a very interesting

13
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:51,667
journey and a very interesting
career. So it was very cool to

14
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:57,156
hear his -- can I just say very a
couple more times [laughs]? I'm

15
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:59,887
excited though. It- it was- it was-
it was a fun time to sit down

16
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:03,962
with Matt. I don't know. He's
had a cool career-

17
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:03,962
Bekah: Yeah.

18
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:08,311
Dan: -and so many at different things
he's like gotten- gotten into. And he's

19
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:12,061
built a lot of different things
and, yeah. It was fun- it was a fun

20
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:12,602
conversation.

21
00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:15,581
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, his
journey is super interesting

22
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:21,432
going from math professor to
working at some really big tech

23
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:26,292
places. And talking about how he
got those jobs by building things

24
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:30,072
that were useful to him, I felt
like was super inspiring to

25
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:33,701
anybody who's trying to break
into tech. But just to see how

26
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:37,001
he developed his career and
followed his interest is really ...

27
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,792
I don't know, inspiring, I
guess.

28
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:43,811
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. And it- it
hit home for me a lot. It's- it's

29
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:45,641
one of those things that I- I
never did consciously, and I

30
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:48,912
don't think Matt did really
either. He- he was -- he would

31
00:01:48,912 --> 00:01:51,522
build things that would help him,
you know, help himself. So he

32
00:01:51,522 --> 00:01:54,611
talked about what he built
something that was like helping

33
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:55,000
to buy tickets or sell tickets.
And-

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Bekah: Yeah.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,932
Dan: -it wasn't like a scheme to make money or a scheme
to get a job [chuckles], you know? It was just a

36
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:06,471
thing that helped him -- his- his-
own, like, life, you know? He

37
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:10,671
wasn't trying to sell the product
or do any of the things that

38
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:14,301
you hear about these days a lot.
He just was like interested

39
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,752
in built something. And then some
people heard about it. And,

40
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:21,000
well, you'll hear about the
rest [laughs]. But it was cool.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Bekah: [Chuckles] Yeah.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,792
Dan: It hit home for me. I- I -- that's -- building projects
is just like -- that's- that's -- my -- that's always

43
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:29,062
my advice to people too, is- is-
is just build things that you're

44
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:32,451
either interested in or could
help yourself. And the rest

45
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:35,961
will come sort of naturally. So, it
was- it was cool. It was -- we --

46
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:37,671
I had a good time talking to him.

47
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:41,752
Bekah: Yeah. It was fascinating
episode. And we hope that you

48
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:44,692
enjoy it and we're going to start
it the same way that we start

49
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:48,622
every Virtual Coffee, with our
names, where we're from, what we

50
00:02:48,622 --> 00:03:00,127
do, and our random check-in
question. So, enjoy. Today's

51
00:03:00,152 --> 00:03:03,842
random check-in question is if
you could appear on any game

52
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:08,853
show, what would it be? I'm
Bekah. I am a technical community

53
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:17,462
builder from a small town in Ohio. And
game show ... I don't know. If there

54
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:21,423
was a "Sudoku" game show, I would like
to try that [chuckles]. I don't think

55
00:03:21,423 --> 00:03:24,000
that's a thing. So I guess I'll
go on "Wheel of Fortune"-

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Dan: Peep- pretty --

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,638
Bekah: -or, I don't know. "Price Is Right".
I feel like I'm -- as an adult, I've

58
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:35,518
gotten better at that. Like [chuckles], "Oh, I know
the price of that." But ...

59
00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:38,038
I don't know. I think I'll
stick with "Wheel of Fortune".

60
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:42,328
Dan: "Wheel of Fortune". Well, it seemed
like a fun- a fun time, you know?

61
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:43,348
Bekah: It doesn't seem so stressful.

62
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:48,388
Dan: I- I feel like- I feel like a "Sudoku" game show
would be pretty boring to watch [chuckles]. But before

63
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:50,818
they compete it- before they compete
it. But because, well, I can tell --

64
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:53,298
Bekah: I mean, like some kind of
obstacles they threw in, right?

65
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:53,298
Dan: Ooh.

66
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:58,668
Bekah: Like, what you fill in one row,
then something happened and you get

67
00:03:58,668 --> 00:04:00,000
slimed. Like [Bekah and Matt laugh] --

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Dan: Slimed [chuckles].

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,763
Bekah: Did you ever watch "Double
Dare" [chuckles]? 

70
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:08,652
Dan: Oh, man. Okay. So, hi.
I'm Dan. I do front-end

71
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:13,252
development, mostly, and live in
Cleveland, and ... oh, yeah,

72
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,723
yeah. Game show, "American
Gladiators" is the first thing

73
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,382
that popped into my head.

74
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:18,617
Bekah: Ooh. I did [crosstalk] --
that's what I'm doing [laughs].

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Matt McInnis: Oh, how are you
doing, sir?

76
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:22,622
Dan: [Laughs] I- I always wanted to
do -- especially the one -- the, like,

77
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:25,083
thing I feel like they ended
with it. But the- the watery

78
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:28,533
run around shooting the, like, the
Nerf guns at the, you know, and

79
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:31,262
the -- like the- the gladiator person
is up on the top shooting Nerf gun

80
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:33,543
stuff at your tennis [??] balls.
I- I don't really know. I haven't

81
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:34,862
watched it, obviously, in a
long time, but [laughs] --

82
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:37,038
Bekah: "American Ninja Warrior",
too. I forgot. Ugh.

83
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:40,382
Dan: "American Ninja Warrior" is cool. It
-- that seems a lot harder though. But it

84
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:43,293
would be cool to try. I would
definitely try that for sure.

85
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:45,302
Matt: But would you be a contestant or one
of the gladiators if you're in the show?

86
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:47,252
Dan: Well, I mean now I'd have
to start- I'd have to start as a

87
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:47,000
contestant, you know?

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Matt: Yeah. [Unintelligible].

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,773
Dan: I- I can't -- I'm not gonna just like swoop in and,
you know? I gotta- I gotta earn my- earn my way up,

90
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:59,552
right? [Dan and Matt laugh] But yeah, I feel-
I feel like -- plus it get the -- well, did

91
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:03,182
the contestants have the ... what
do you call them? Like a ... not a

92
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:07,862
jumpsuit, but the ... we called these things that
they were ... or like that wrestlers or anything?

93
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:08,000
Matt: Yeah, I think it's a suit.
I think it's a jumpsuit.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Dan: No, no, no.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,733
Matt: No, there's a name for it, isn't that
[laughs]? What's the thing? We make it --

96
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:14,702
Dan: We need Nick here [chuckles].
What's the thing that like

97
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:16,000
wrestlers wear, like- like-

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Bekah: A singlet?

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,262
Dan: Nah -- yes, singlet maybe?
I don't know.

100
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:22,757
Matt: I think there's another word for it,
but it's- it's not leotards, is it? No.

101
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:26,072
Dan: No. I mean, it's basically
leotard, but it's like singlet.

102
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,583
Bekah: It was a singlet. Singlet
is what you're wearing at wrestling.

103
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:30,002
Dan: I don't know. I don't know. That
doesn't sound right, but you're

104
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:33,192
probably right [Bekah and Matt laugh]. We- we'll ask
Nick after- after the- after the podcast [laugh].

105
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,588
Matt: Yeah. I -- good to be
here, guys. Thank you for having

106
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:42,048
me. I'm Matt. I'm a developer
from Toronto, Canada. I run a

107
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:45,077
small company called Typist where
we make educational software and

108
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:48,497
if I was on one game show, my
first — like, you know, "American

109
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:51,197
Gladiator" wins — but my first
reaction was "Kids Street". It's

110
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:54,528
this old game show. I don't know
if I -- like, if I was 12 years old

111
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:56,898
again, I think it, you know, and
everyone kind of clapped over

112
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,747
their head, like there is this
like thing that they did if they

113
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:03,348
got a question, right? And if you want,
it was like every kid's dream you got to

114
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:07,367
go into like this middle platform.
There was like stalk, like a toy

115
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,788
store? And you had like two
minutes to just grab-

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,788
Dan: Oh, man.

117
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:10,788
Bekah: Ooh.

118
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:14,447
Matt: -whatever you wanted. It was like --
yeah. So my sisters and I, we would watch

119
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,028
"Kids Street" and we be like, "How
do we get on this TV show?" And we

120
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:20,418
never quite cracked the egg on
that one. It was very- very

121
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:24,737
disappointing childhood, I guess, you
could say [laughs], yeah. I'm kidding. But

122
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:29,007
it's a, yeah, kid's dream, but you
know, I, you know, also second Dan's answer,

123
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:29,427
cuz that sounds awesome.

124
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:33,348
Bekah: Wow. I have never seen
"Kids Street" before.

125
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:36,747
Matt: Like -- yeah, there's this funny
kind of Canadian, you know, from

126
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:40,468
Canada. This is funny
Canadian subculture around some

127
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:43,798
things. Like there are these
really kind of weird things that

128
00:06:43,798 --> 00:06:46,648
pop up every now and then that
are extremely popular. Like,

129
00:06:46,648 --> 00:06:49,247
"Household", everybody knows
them. Even like music and bands

130
00:06:49,247 --> 00:06:52,468
sometimes. They were fueled
by this entertainment industry

131
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:54,507
that like out of Toronto. But like
these companies called MuchMusic

132
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:57,358
and they're related
subsidiaries, but are just

133
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:59,728
totally unknown in the US. And it
-- which is funny because the US

134
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:02,932
is just a two-hour drive from where I'm
living. Like, it close, right? Like,

135
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:06,413
we're- we're right there. We- we go
to Buffalo Bills games all the time.

136
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:08,273
It's across this, you know, it
feels like it's across the

137
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:10,733
street. But you go down there and
they're like, "Oh, they tragically

138
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,973
hip." And it like, every -- like,
you know, half of Canada is all

139
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:16,642
time favorite band and people in
the US are like, "Who?" like, "Who

140
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:19,853
is that?" You know, it's -- there's
these things. So "Kids Street" might

141
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:23,273
be one of them too. And, you
know, all these like kinda old

142
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:24,262
TV shows for kids, especially.

143
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:29,072
Bekah: Yeah, I need to check it out. I-
I, like, pulled up the -- oh, it is a

144
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:32,853
Canadian's children's game show.
So --

145
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:36,757
Matt: It is Canadian. I -- ah, you guys missed out.
This was epic. Like [Bekah laughs] -- and it would

146
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,338
have been -- it would have like -- it would've
been way better if the US had done it [laughs].

147
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:45,427
Like, the mall would have been cooler. Like, it would
have just been -- like- like, production quality would

148
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:47,557
have been way up there. Like,
where's Nickelodeon at when-

149
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:48,663
Bekah: Yeah.

150
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,327
Matt: -for "Kids Street" [laughs].

151
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:52,067
Bekah: I love it. It looks very
80s. I need to check this

152
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:52,338
out [chuckles].

153
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:54,048
Matt: Yeah, it was cool [chuckles].

154
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,827
Bekah: Well, thanks so much for
being here with us today, Matt.

155
00:07:57,858 --> 00:08:02,208
We always like to get started
with your origin stories. So, if

156
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:07,517
you could give us what the story
is that brought you here to

157
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:08,838
today, where you are in tech.

158
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:13,228
Matt: Yeah, thanks. Thank you
for having me, Dan and Bekah.

159
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:17,802
Yeah. You know, I-I guess it-it -- like
starting -- focusing on the tech side of

160
00:08:17,802 --> 00:08:21,973
things, I, you know, graduated --
I did degrees in math. I love

161
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:27,312
math. I think it's still my Twitter
handle [chuckles]. I -- and I -- and, you

162
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:29,502
know, I went -- I decided that like
the change I wanna make in

163
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:31,663
the world after graduating was I
wanted to improve the way that

164
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:34,543
people learn mathematics at the
post-secondary level. I- I just, you

165
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:38,577
know, my -- their programs that I took
were massacres. We had such few people

166
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:42,148
finish relative to how many
started. And, you know, I worked

167
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:44,398
all the way through university.
and math help centers, and as a

168
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:48,298
TA, and I saw people in non-math
disciplines kinda drop out of

169
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:50,368
their like early childhood
education program because they

170
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:53,927
couldn't complete their stats
course. And I thought that was crazy.

171
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:56,538
Because if it's taught properly,
I don't think math is hard,

172
00:08:56,748 --> 00:09:01,128
you know? Put that strong caveat
if it's taught properly. And so I

173
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:03,947
really wanted to kind of affect
change there. I took a job. I

174
00:09:03,947 --> 00:09:06,977
applied everywhere for these --
in Canada, we call them 'math

175
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:10,638
professorships' at community
colleges in Canada. In US

176
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:13,577
it's probably known as a math
instructor, at the community --

177
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:16,682
in the community college system.
And, so, I took a job in

178
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:19,923
Saskatchewan. I moved from the small
town of Aurora, Ontario — where

179
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:23,852
I grew up — to Prince Albert,
Saskatchewan, which is 40,000

180
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:27,663
person town, like in the, you
know, it- it was really awesome. I

181
00:09:27,663 --> 00:09:31,038
loved it out there and I had some
family there too. And that's

182
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:34,697
where, you know, I- I guess my
journey to tech started. I,

183
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,947
you know, I was a math person.
I really had no experience with

184
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:41,597
tech at that point. I was, you
know, 24 ... 23/24. And

185
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:46,697
I- I just started wanting to make
things. I remember the first

186
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:50,177
thing I wanted to make was I had
read, you know, a book that's now very

187
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:53,717
popular Malcolm Gladwell's "[The]
Tipping Point". And he described

188
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:56,087
like "Sesame Street" in the 80s.
And how they would like

189
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,273
engineer this TV show. They would
bring kids in and they would put

190
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:01,643
"Sesame Street" on one screen, and
this thing called the distractor

191
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:05,182
on the other screen. And
every seven seconds, this

192
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:07,793
distractor would display these
still images that would switch.

193
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:10,283
So every seven seconds, a
different image. And you'd put

194
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:12,773
like 20 kids in the room and the
researchers would just look at

195
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:14,692
their eyes and be like, are they
looking at the distractor? Are

196
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:17,243
they looking at "Sesame Street"?
And then they would go back and

197
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:19,523
they'd graph it after they'd
done, like a couple of cycles of

198
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:22,072
kids. And they'd see what are the
parts of the TV show that kids

199
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:25,832
were disengaged with, that we need to
re-engineer? And that was like the

200
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,543
first that I was like, "Man, if
they could do that in the

201
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,633
80s, why can't, like in --" you
know, this was, I guess like

202
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,932
2010. I'm like, "Why can't we do
that like in real time, live,

203
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:37,008
while I'm teaching in class?" And
that was my first project was I

204
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:40,427
wanted to build something that
did that. And I had learned that

205
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:43,217
Hasbro had put out this toy
called the hi- like the Star

206
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:47,388
Wars force trainer. Where everything was
ridiculous, [chuckles] so I -- we'd have like

207
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:50,087
a headset that you'd put on. And
it turns out this thing could

208
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:54,587
actually take a, like a low level EEG
reading of brain activity, like if

209
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:58,293
your brain was active or not. And
then like the toy would connect

210
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:02,013
wirelessly to this base unit that
had a fan that would spin a ball

211
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:04,952
up and down in this toy. And so
it like, hence the force

212
00:11:04,952 --> 00:11:07,263
trainer, is you concentrate
really hard and you can use the

213
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:11,793
force to move this ball up and down [laughs].
Like, really cool toy, right? And I

214
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:13,893
said, "Well, if I could just get
the electrical signal out of that

215
00:11:13,893 --> 00:11:16,503
into my computer and graph
it, that would be the whole

216
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:20,283
thing." And that was my first
foray into tech, was -- I, like,

217
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:22,952
started -- I was like, "Okay.
Well, how do I get the electrical

218
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:26,673
signal out? And how does- how
does electricity work? And how

219
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:29,942
does circuits work?" And, you
know, I learned about

220
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:32,582
microprocessors and the Arduino
had to like just come out at the

221
00:11:32,582 --> 00:11:37,202
time. And so I started like getting
these -- like, yeah, I found that

222
00:11:37,202 --> 00:11:39,302
kids' books for Arduino are actually
way better than the ones that are

223
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:41,793
making for adults. So that -- I
got all these like kids' books and

224
00:11:42,212 --> 00:11:45,552
started like doing these experiments.
And then I- I needed, you

225
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:48,192
know, these wires solder. So I'd
go down to the electrical

226
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:50,383
department and be like, "Hey, guy.
I was teaching like math for

227
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:52,903
electricians as part of my job there."
They're like, "Hey, can you do

228
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:55,753
some soldering for me? And like, put
these --" And it, you know, at this

229
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:59,023
point it would like kind of become
this, like, project. And I gotta

230
00:11:59,023 --> 00:12:03,222
working after, you know, on
the code side, I learned that

231
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,503
there's this language called
Processing, which was Java based

232
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,023
that could do the graphing pretty
easily for me if I could just

233
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:12,283
pull the signal in. And I got that
working. And then I, you know, like six

234
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:14,773
months later presented it at a
conference down in Saskatoon, one

235
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:18,722
of the cities in Saskatchewan. And
at that point I was hooked. And,

236
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:22,293
you know, from there, I- I just --
I really wanted to continue making

237
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:25,113
things that would make me a
better teacher. And that drove me

238
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:28,113
for a long time. And then, you
know, a-a couple of years after

239
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:31,383
that, I- I started doing reflection
of what do I want in terms of a

240
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,712
career, and a lifestyle, and like,
what are the things I'm after?

241
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:38,192
And that really kind of led me to
getting interested in, you know, code

242
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:42,543
as a career. And there
weren't really, you know,

243
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:45,033
bootcamps and Coursera, I don't
even think I'd been really

244
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:48,092
created at that point, or launched
or, you know, the whole suite of

245
00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:50,582
the EdEx, Udemy, Coursera,
awesome websites for these

246
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:54,363
things, right? So it was a lot
of learning. It was -- I, you

247
00:12:54,363 --> 00:12:57,092
know, I did that all while I had
a full-time job. And, you know,

248
00:12:57,092 --> 00:13:01,893
fast forward a-a number of years,
I launched Typist, the company I

249
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:05,582
now have run, I made a little small
passion project that I sometimes call

250
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:10,442
it. At the same time, I -- AI
exploded. And this was maybe

251
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:15,302
six or -- a six-ish -- six, seven
years ago now. At AI, if nothing else

252
00:13:15,302 --> 00:13:18,543
is a combination of computer science
and it's like a really strong

253
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:22,682
math background. And, you know,
back then, more emphasis on

254
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:25,113
the math, but today maybe more
emphasis on the computer science

255
00:13:25,113 --> 00:13:31,217
side and- and so, I-IBM came knocking
and said, "Hey, we are trying to

256
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,717
hire AI expertise." And I --
and at that point, I had some

257
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:40,248
projects that like, I was
experimenting a lot in AI. And so

258
00:13:40,248 --> 00:13:42,738
they brought me into -- they
offered me like dream job to go

259
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:47,087
in and be on this new open source
team that they're putting across

260
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:50,447
Canada. And I'd get to work with all
their -- these huge companies and help

261
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:52,998
them do AI better and solve these
problems. And that sounded like a

262
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,962
blast. So I did that for a
number of years. And then later I

263
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:59,503
moved over to Microsoft to do a
similar type work, like more-

264
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:01,633
more hands. I wanted to get
deeper into projects, and

265
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,913
Microsoft gave me that
opportunity to go deeper into data

266
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:07,962
science projects with, you
know, companies. And all for

267
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:11,143
free. Like, these companies would just
parachute me in. Or IBM would just --

268
00:14:11,232 --> 00:14:14,082
Microsoft would just parachute me
in and it's like, "Yeah. We- we're

269
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:16,332
gonna help you do data science
better because if you do it on

270
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:19,217
our cloud, we're gonna make a lot
of money." So I'd get to go and just

271
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:21,768
like pick my projects and go
onsite. I get like a badge. It

272
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:24,798
was awesome. And, you know, and
build out these data science

273
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,378
projects. And all the while, on my
evenings and weekends, building

274
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:30,798
out Typist, trying to get it to
the place where it could support,

275
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:33,707
you know, a basic income for me
and I could work on it full-time

276
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:38,057
which eventually happened. And-
and, you know, that sort of

277
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:41,923
switch over process was scary and,
you know, different than I'm -- had

278
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,793
imagined it would be. But
eventually my boss at Microsoft

279
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:48,972
was like, "Matt, you gotta go do this.
You- you -- it's there. Like, go do this

280
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:52,302
thing." And- and I- and I did.
And I -- and that's what I've

281
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:54,253
been working on for the last
three or four years.

282
00:14:55,633 --> 00:15:01,937
Bekah: That's- that's amazing. I
have to ask about that switch. Cuz I

283
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:08,717
feel like that sounds like s-s-s -- very
scary [chuckles]. Like, giving up all of the

284
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:12,918
stuff that you've been doing with
a team, with all of these

285
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:19,847
resources and then just jumping into
this entrepreneur journey. I- I know

286
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:23,687
that you said that you had some
encouragement, but like, what

287
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:27,227
really pushed you to go all
in on Typist?

288
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:31,687
Matt: Ah, you know, it was --
it- it was really, really hard.

289
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:38,253
You know, I- I- I guess like one
of the big factors was I thought

290
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:43,413
that we- we had a project lined
up for Typist. And- and Typist --

291
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,753
maybe this is the appropriate
time to kinda speak to what it

292
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:50,552
is. We make software for
community college students who

293
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:54,003
are taking a certain set of courses.
So our- our first product was

294
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:57,977
for community college students who
are taking keyboarding courses. And

295
00:15:58,008 --> 00:16:00,798
those are people studying
programs to be law clerks, or

296
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:02,957
legal assistance, medical
assistance, or even executive

297
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:06,768
assistants. And very -- and, you know,
there's interesting demographics

298
00:16:06,768 --> 00:16:09,197
in those programs, such as -- a
reason I'm really passionate to

299
00:16:09,197 --> 00:16:13,638
work on and honored to build
software for that group. And

300
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:16,727
then we have this second product,
which at that point, Bekah, was-

301
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:22,528
I was really -- we had scoped it out.
And it was the -- and this thing called

302
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:25,408
'document production'. So, you
know, people that go in these

303
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:28,107
fields need to be able to make a
professionally formatted business

304
00:16:28,107 --> 00:16:30,778
letter that has these exact
traits and the -- it's sort of a

305
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:34,827
vocational skill. And in that
particular field, it's rated as

306
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,307
like a top three employment skill
to -- by all every industry

307
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:41,278
survey that's ever been done.
And it's really, really hard to

308
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,952
teach. And I -- we had -- one of the
colle- I've been like kinda

309
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:48,873
kicking the tires with the people
who are using our keyboarding

310
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:51,113
software, an be like, "Hey, does anyone
wanna partner to build this with us?

311
00:16:51,373 --> 00:16:54,482
And by partner, just like give us
feedback, tell us- tell us what

312
00:16:54,482 --> 00:16:57,722
to build, like whiteboard. And- and
ideally, if we build you something

313
00:16:57,722 --> 00:17:01,743
that you really liked, be the, you
know, the person to use it and give us

314
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:04,952
the reference so that we can
maybe expand this." And I -- and

315
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:07,022
that was a big part of the
decision was I had all that lined

316
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:11,883
up. And so for the six to seven
months prior to that, and

317
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:15,423
this was the final push, I had
outsourced the development of it

318
00:17:15,423 --> 00:17:20,252
to a really great developer who --
it -- like, grades -- you know,

319
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:24,992
really, really talented Rails
developer. And we had a

320
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:28,323
prototype. And we went back to
this college and presented this.

321
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:30,153
And I'd take vacation days
anytime I had to go take

322
00:17:30,153 --> 00:17:33,212
meetings, right? So all of my
vacation for those like four years was

323
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:36,272
consumed by Typist. And so
I'd take a vacation day. I'd go

324
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:38,942
and we'd present this back to the
group. And they had said, "Yes. If

325
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,012
you can build it and it can do
these things, but we need these

326
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:45,573
changes, you know, we'll use
it." But at that point I looked

327
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:49,833
with -- like- like, how we had constructed
the software. And I said, "It's not

328
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,403
gonna get us to the finish line."
We were, you know, specifically we'd

329
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:56,613
built it in Rails and it -- like, it
all works with file IO. So either you

330
00:17:56,623 --> 00:18:00,093
need to upload this file and then
we would go compare it to this

331
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:03,032
other file. And they're both Word
documents, which are incredibly

332
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:03,000
hard to work with.

333
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

334
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,008
Matt: And we, like, you know, the- the way all the existing
previous software, like, if there's a typo in a paragraph,

335
00:18:10,248 --> 00:18:12,647
you lost all the marks of the
paragraph, because doing fuzzy

336
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:16,907
matching is like really, really
hard. And we just -- I- I sat there

337
00:18:16,907 --> 00:18:19,248
and I'm like, "We can't do this in our
web server." This -- it takes like 20

338
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:22,577
seconds to process a single file,
we'll be in classes, they'll do a test,

339
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:25,742
they'll get 30 uploads at once, we'll
never be able to handle the spike in

340
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:28,313
traffic, we'll never be able to --
we- we don't wanna web server

341
00:18:28,313 --> 00:18:31,563
sitting idle for it. And I just, long
story short, knew and I -- we had to

342
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:34,442
rebuild the software completely
from scratch. And we had five

343
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:37,432
months to do it. We had gone in
and already produced like -- we

344
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:40,022
already done the demo and been
like, "Yeah, it's working. Look."

345
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:42,722
And I knew that we had to throw
away everything that we'd done

346
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,962
and build it from scratch, and --
which we did. So that was

347
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:50,282
like the imme- there's an immediacy
which helped, I guess, make that decision

348
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:53,373
of like, I'd -- like -- so when I went
in and had that conversation with

349
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:56,792
my wonderful, wonderful boss, I
was scay [??] and I was explaining

350
00:18:56,792 --> 00:19:01,742
this all to her. She's like -- I'm- I'm
like -- I was scay [??], I've like, "If

351
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:05,133
we're gonna launch this thing
and this could push Typist over

352
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:08,522
the mark of, like, it could
support a couple employees,

353
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:13,008
I've got to go now. Like I- I- I can't
wait till next week. I've- I've got to

354
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:17,357
start right now." And she's
like, "Yep. Do it." And at that

355
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:20,538
point, I ... like almost on the spot
gave my notice. I talked to my

356
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:25,788
wife and- and that was the jump.
And it was a hard summer, by the

357
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:26,087
way [chuckles]. It was tough.

358
00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:31,223
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that's pretty intense. [Chuckles]
I mean, obviously I don't [Dan and Matt chuckle] ...

359
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:37,114
but it seems like it worked
out, right? I mean, kinda betting

360
00:19:37,114 --> 00:19:38,000
on yourself and -- I mean, it-

361
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Matt: Yeah.

362
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,054
Dan: -might be wasn't much of a bet. Have you -- did you have a good idea
of -- so you said you had to, you know, tear it down and- and rebuild

363
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:50,163
it. Did you have a good idea at that,
like, moment of like what it was

364
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:52,713
gonna look like when you were
finished rebuilding it or were

365
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:55,173
you just like, we have, like -- are
start from scratch and I have no

366
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:55,923
idea, you know?

367
00:19:56,084 --> 00:20:00,394
Matt: Yeah. We- we knew that -- and- and
I did. And maybe, you know, I -- and

368
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:01,963
I'm happy to speak to the kinda
the details of it, because I

369
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:03,000
think they're interesting if
that's ... you know?

370
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Bekah: Yeah, sure.

371
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Dan: Yeah.

372
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,784
Matt: So, like, we, you know, I mentioned we
couldn't do this on web servers. Because like, you

373
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:12,634
know, the really simple use case
was that if 20 students are doing

374
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:14,763
a test, and they all upload their
documents at once, and they take

375
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:18,423
25 seconds to process, web servers
just can't do that. We would have

376
00:20:18,423 --> 00:20:21,243
to have like this incredible
scale that would just be so

377
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:26,709
expensive, we couldn't run the
business. And so, the -- my-

378
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:31,538
my theory was that we needed a
couple of things. We needed to not be

379
00:20:31,538 --> 00:20:35,048
using Ruby because like a- a node
based system made a lot more

380
00:20:35,048 --> 00:20:38,078
sense in the way that a node
event loop works, you know? And-

381
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,308
and the second thing was we
needed a way to deploy these sort

382
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,558
of algorithms that we were
building in a way that can handle

383
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,534
these spikes in traffic. And at
that point, sort of lamb- this

384
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:51,773
Lambda architecture. Which is,
you know, all the clouds have a

385
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:55,044
product for this. So in Microsoft
is called Azure functions, in AWS

386
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:59,993
is called Lambda, in -- you can have,
net- Netlify just launched one I

387
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:02,034
think actually, and Cloudflare
has one called Cloudflare

388
00:21:02,034 --> 00:21:05,423
functions too. But they basically
work that like something happens,

389
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:08,304
and these -- they spin up your code, and
they do the thing you want it to do, and

390
00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:11,394
then they spin down, and you can
throw a thousand at them. And

391
00:21:11,423 --> 00:21:13,673
they, you know, a thousand
instances will spit up, you'll

392
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:17,028
pay for the time they're up, and then
they'll turn off, and you're done. And so

393
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:20,959
that was kind of what I knew, was that
we had to rewrite this into that --

394
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:23,898
this Lambda type architecture
that could handle these spikes.

395
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:27,078
We had to use -- we had to switch
languages. So we had to use a

396
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,659
language that was compatible
there in while supported and Ruby

397
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:33,138
wasn't supported at all. So that
had to go to JavaScript. And then

398
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:35,628
there was, you know, to your
question, Dan, there- there were

399
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,749
questions that I was really, really
concerned about, which were, how

400
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:43,648
are we going to go in and like
that problem on evaluation? So if

401
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:45,808
you're a student, you upload this
document and you're off by like

402
00:21:45,808 --> 00:21:49,229
two characters, we couldn't take
off all of the marks, right? So

403
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:52,648
we had to be able to go in and
compare the texts. We expected

404
00:21:52,648 --> 00:21:56,009
students to type in the text that they did
type and take off some of -- like of -- like

405
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:00,028
type of marks of as proportions
to do that and give meaningful

406
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,398
feedback on the other side. And
at that point, I had no idea how

407
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:07,433
we're gonna solve that problem.
Yeah, which we, you know, later

408
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:10,463
figured out a way to. And even
just converting, like how do we

409
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:13,913
even -- so, you know, just as a
quick comment, DOCX files are really

410
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:15,834
hard to work with, but here's
like a fun thing you can do. If

411
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,314
you're on a Windows machine, take
a DOCX file to your desktop, rename

412
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:25,314
it to .zip. And then extract it, and
you'll see the general how these struck-

413
00:22:25,913 --> 00:22:28,554
files are structured. In- inside,
there is all this kind of markup

414
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:30,324
that will be a little bit
familiar to you if you've seen

415
00:22:30,324 --> 00:22:34,163
XML or HTML before. And you
can see all the stuff in there.

416
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:36,983
So we knew that we had to like
deal with that problem too, which

417
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:39,503
we didn't know how we were gonna
handle, because we were using

418
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:41,933
these Ruby libraries that kind
of abstracted that away for us.

419
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:48,564
Bekah: Mm. Yeah. So you made this
career journey, I guess. So from

420
00:22:48,564 --> 00:22:54,443
math and then you were doing AI,
data science stuff, and then

421
00:22:54,653 --> 00:23:00,324
Rails back-end stuff and- and now
JavaScript and React, right?

422
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,999
Matt: Yeah. And- and, you know,
I think the first part of that

423
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:07,838
would be like, it's worth
expanding on, like, it was --

424
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:11,348
like when I started learning code,
it, like -- I, you know, data

425
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,854
science is generally on in
Python and R. Like, those are the

426
00:23:13,854 --> 00:23:17,034
language for data science and
heavy emphasis on Python these

427
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:20,394
days. Like, academic C's are,
but nobody else really does.

428
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:24,114
And so the -- like, I really didn't
know a ton of Python, but it's

429
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:27,834
such an approachable language. I
really, that -- like that seven

430
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:32,699
years of learning code, like, you
know, I- I breezed past it in a

431
00:23:32,699 --> 00:23:35,699
sentence, but that was really
hard. It was a lot of evenings

432
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:39,419
and weekends. I was working full
time that whole time, I, at some

433
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,929
points, had like even taking on
contract gigs, doing statistical

434
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:46,979
consulting for some stuff. And-
and it was webdev that I was

435
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:50,098
learning during that time, Bekah.
And it was, you know, I had

436
00:23:50,098 --> 00:23:54,653
started the -- with a -- like [chuckles],
you know, I started with HTML and

437
00:23:54,653 --> 00:23:57,953
CSS and had like -- learned that,
and built a personal website.

438
00:23:57,953 --> 00:24:00,473
And it was like, you know, these
projects, all the way through,

439
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:05,064
like I wanted -- like at the time
people were downloading TV shows

440
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:08,513
and movies and stuff maybe [chuckles],
you know, maybe they shouldn't. But it

441
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,153
was like really hard. So, like, if I wanted
to go -- if I download the new season

442
00:24:11,513 --> 00:24:13,973
of "The Office", I wanted to search
"The Office" and have it organized,

443
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:17,003
like Episode 1, Episode 2, Episode 3,
and then get rid of the ones

444
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:20,439
were like somebody holding their camera
and do others. So, does a website

445
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:25,088
to do that? And it was like so
basic. It was a single PHP file

446
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:29,259
that just went and like kind of
scraped the Pirate Bay, and then

447
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:33,429
analyze the file names. And
then, I- I had no idea how to use

448
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,669
databases, so it would just stick
the results [chuckles] into like a text

449
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:41,183
file [laughs]. I'm like, "Go, daddy."
So it was -- like, that's where I was

450
00:24:41,183 --> 00:24:41,000
starting from. And-

451
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Dan: That's awesome.

452
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,114
Matt: -it was -- so there's like, there's that. There
were ... oh, like, oh my god. There's so many other. Like

453
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:50,304
another one that was fun was
when I was teaching at the

454
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:54,973
college, you'd put all your marks
into like an Excel doc. So I was like,

455
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:57,523
"Okay. Well, I want like to give my
students more contextual feedback

456
00:24:57,523 --> 00:24:59,653
on how they're doing in the
course." So I put it into a Google

457
00:24:59,653 --> 00:25:01,604
doc and I was like, "How do I get
this thing to send email?" And

458
00:25:01,604 --> 00:25:03,163
then that was like, one of the
first things I had written in

459
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:06,614
JavaScript, was to like, go take
all my students, and if they're

460
00:25:06,614 --> 00:25:10,003
like -- if they've not done well on
the first two quizzes, send them

461
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:13,523
an email that's like, "Hey, you
know, John. I- I saw you didn't do

462
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:15,594
very well in the first few
quizzes. Here are my office

463
00:25:15,594 --> 00:25:18,294
hours. There's also the math help
center if you need support. I'm

464
00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:21,473
here for you. Like, you know,
like really wanna help you turn

465
00:25:21,473 --> 00:25:23,784
this around [chuckles]." And then, if
they were doing really well, they'd get

466
00:25:23,784 --> 00:25:26,513
like a more positive note with different
content. And there were -- I had like

467
00:25:26,513 --> 00:25:28,374
six different templates, and then
I would just hit go, and then

468
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:30,743
everybody would get an email from me and
like my five [unintelligible] sections or

469
00:25:30,743 --> 00:25:31,074
whatever. I [laughs] --

470
00:25:33,084 --> 00:25:37,493
Bekah: [Laughs] I- I- I need that 10
years ago. That would save me so much

471
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:40,044
time. Wow. That's amazing.

472
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,433
Matt: It's great. But like, the part that
I felt guilty about, Bekah, it was I'd get

473
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:46,493
these responses and be like, "Wow.
You -- thank you for taking the time to

474
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:53,034
write me this email [all laughs]." Yeah. You know-
you know? I -- it was -- but they were like --

475
00:25:53,673 --> 00:25:56,284
Bekah: I thought that's a -- wait. Is that
not a product for teachers? Because if

476
00:25:56,284 --> 00:25:58,713
it's not, it totally should be.

477
00:25:58,713 --> 00:25:58,933
Matt: It should be.

478
00:25:58,933 --> 00:25:59,263
Dan: Was it just like -- that's
like-

479
00:25:59,423 --> 00:25:59,874
Matt: Yeah.

480
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:03,374
Dan: -a CRM, right? A CRM, except
for students, is like, you have

481
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:06,223
all the automated- automated mail
campaigns and stuff, you know [laughs]?

482
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:09,044
Except you're- except you're
emailing students. It's amazing.

483
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:10,124
Bekah: Yes. Yeah. Okay. But this -- I [Matt laughs]
need to Google this after we're done. Because-

484
00:26:10,243 --> 00:26:10,973
Dan: It has to exist.

485
00:26:11,443 --> 00:26:14,324
Bekah: -if- if it is a thing, I
need to tell everybody that I

486
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:18,614
know — that still a teacher — about
it. And if not, then that's my new

487
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:19,124
project [chuckles].

488
00:26:19,838 --> 00:26:22,659
Matt: Yeah. It's, you know, so
that was like -- there were these

489
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:25,449
projects on the way, right? And
they were all usually connected

490
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:27,788
to something I wanted to see in
the world. Like -- and another

491
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:30,788
really big one I took on that was
like less code, but it was, you

492
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:34,388
know, it was my first experience
with Rails was, you know, we

493
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:38,243
had -- I was teaching at the college
and I was helping to volunteer

494
00:26:38,243 --> 00:26:40,374
coach this marketing team,
which I don't know what I was

495
00:26:40,374 --> 00:26:44,334
doing there. I was like the
math guy, right? And I -- but I

496
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:46,644
wanted to get my students more
experiencing the actual -- like

497
00:26:46,644 --> 00:26:48,773
the part of marketing that really
is interesting to me is the

498
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,894
analytics of it. There's really
rich analytics and the math is

499
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:56,183
just super fun to look at, but
there is like Google Analytics

500
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:58,673
was out there at the time. But it
was really hard to get experience

501
00:26:58,673 --> 00:27:00,564
with actual data. So I thought,
"Well, what if we could get like a

502
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:03,864
website up that would, you
know, have a bunch of data that

503
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:06,743
students could just mess around
with? And we could like do stuff.

504
00:27:06,743 --> 00:27:09,503
We could go put posters up and
drive traffic." And- and then

505
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:11,814
like, I was also really
interested in — and still am — in

506
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:14,124
volunteerism. And I said, "You
know, I've had these great,

507
00:27:14,124 --> 00:27:16,794
wonderful, like life-changing
experience volunteering. Like,

508
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:21,804
you know, what if we could drive
more volunteers to charities?"

509
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:25,074
And, you know, I was also really
attracted to short video format.

510
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:30,084
So, I sorta took the summer off and
I emailed the -- sort of CEOs of

511
00:27:30,263 --> 00:27:34,074
charities in Toronto, and said, "Hey,
I- I went on, you know, Facebook and

512
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:36,144
Craigslist trying to find a
videographer who involved here

513
00:27:36,144 --> 00:27:39,233
with me." And I did. And we went --
my- my pitch was like, "Hey, we're

514
00:27:39,233 --> 00:27:41,483
gonna take your CEO. We're
gonna go onsite where

515
00:27:41,483 --> 00:27:44,034
volunteerism is happening. We're
gonna shoot like a 45 second

516
00:27:44,034 --> 00:27:46,973
to one minute video of you
telling volunteers why it would

517
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:50,453
be so great to volunteer with your ther-
your organization." And we did that.

518
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:52,794
And we did like five of the
biggest charities in Toronto. And

519
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:56,124
we put them on a website I call [chuckles]
-- that I called Where The Good Is. And

520
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:58,074
then we took the marketing ever
since. We promoted it around the

521
00:27:58,074 --> 00:28:00,923
college and then like we'd Google in
with [unintelligible], that they would

522
00:28:00,923 --> 00:28:03,203
like drive the traffic to the
website, we got to analyze it

523
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:06,384
all. And it was really fun. And
that was like my first website in

524
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,023
Rails. It was a static web page
with just a bunch of videos, but

525
00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:13,253
it was a great way to learn. And- and-
and there's probably like a million

526
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:17,469
other projects that a little, you know, similar.
But those -- that's what I was learning. That

527
00:28:17,618 --> 00:28:20,169
seven years was -- I was really
getting into web development. I

528
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:24,128
loved it. I loved making things.
And the more relevant they were

529
00:28:24,128 --> 00:28:28,479
for me, the better. And, you
know, my last one, which was like

530
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:31,538
a full Rails app — that was just a
static page, right — was this -- I

531
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:35,199
wanted a Chrome extension. So my
wife, my -- who was my girlfriend

532
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:37,598
at the time, we could just hit a
button in Chrome and we could

533
00:28:37,598 --> 00:28:39,308
share the webpage that we're
looking at with like a little

534
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:41,739
note. And it would just like
jumped to the other person's

535
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:44,653
browser. And so I built a little app
that did that. And that was like

536
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:51,163
the first, you know, full ... like
real, meaningful, like, web app, you

537
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:55,753
know? Like, they did stuff on the back
end and use the database. And- and, you

538
00:28:55,753 --> 00:28:58,663
know, during that time also,
courses started coming out. So

539
00:28:58,663 --> 00:29:01,513
I took wonderful database course
from Stanford and then the

540
00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:04,993
University of Washington has
amazing courses. And- and

541
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,824
that allowed me to kinda get to
the bottom of how these things

542
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:09,969
worked, which I was incredibly
curious about. Like the

543
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:11,828
hardware, software interface
course from the University of

544
00:29:11,828 --> 00:29:13,719
Washington is just straight up
one of the best courses I've ever

545
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:16,509
taken. Like -- it's like how it,
like, it tackles the problem of --

546
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:19,749
like, how does the code you type
in Python change things in a

547
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:22,358
computer and how does the
computer work it all? And that

548
00:29:22,358 --> 00:29:25,568
was like the missing gap that I
needed to kind of address. And

549
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:29,189
that was a wonderful experience.
And- and yeah, that's what --

550
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:31,778
like, that seven years was like.
And- and then towards the end of

551
00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:34,598
it, the- the project that I made, that
kind of got the attention of IBM,

552
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:39,308
was I had like -- had -- this is [chuckles]- this
is -- am I- am I rambling here? I feel like I'm

553
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:39,759
talking about --

554
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:40,509
Bekah: No. This is great.

555
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:40,509
Dan: No.

556
00:29:41,078 --> 00:29:45,759
Matt: The -- had I -- the ever big
baseball fan, I've got my little

557
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,669
Blue Jays hat in the background on-
on the yellow shirt behind me.

558
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:52,808
And- and we love going to the home
opener, which is the first baseball

559
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:58,118
game of the year. And I had gone
and we buy tickets, but they always

560
00:29:58,118 --> 00:30:00,338
sell out, so you have to buy
resale. And resales like three

561
00:30:00,338 --> 00:30:04,449
times the price. And we paid --
that one year, we paid like $110,

562
00:30:04,568 --> 00:30:07,328
which was outrageous at the time
to sit in like $20 seats at like

563
00:30:07,328 --> 00:30:10,949
the top of the stadium. And I was
so upset by this, you know? I

564
00:30:10,949 --> 00:30:14,409
was ... really. And then, you know,
one of my friends can come. So I

565
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:17,463
had to -- like, I tried to scalp
the ticket. So I was like outside the

566
00:30:17,463 --> 00:30:20,973
stadium [Bekah giggles] instead of like --
and I, like, how do -- you know, a couple of

567
00:30:21,273 --> 00:30:25,173
bottles of juice to give myself the courage to do
it [Matt and Dan laugh]? And- and so, I'm- I'm

568
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:28,144
standing outside the stadium with my
best cover and I was like, "Tickets?

569
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:34,443
[Bekah laughs] Do you guys need tickets?" And I remember
there's this -- I'd -- like, of all there's 50,000

570
00:30:34,443 --> 00:30:36,304
people there, of course like a
friend walks by and he's like,

571
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:38,824
"What in the hell are you doing?"
and "What in the heck you

572
00:30:38,824 --> 00:30:41,973
do?" And then I'll -- there -- I never
forget this mom and her daughter. The

573
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:45,564
daughter must've been like 17/18 years
old, right? And they're- they're walking

574
00:30:45,564 --> 00:30:48,983
by and I'm out there just, "Tickets," [Bekah giggles]
and "You need a ticket?" And she's so

575
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:54,173
politely says, "No, thank you." Everyone just ignores me
and she just, "No, thank you." And she looks at me and then

576
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:57,324
looks down at my shirt and I've
got my University Western shirt

577
00:30:57,324 --> 00:31:00,864
on [Bekah giggles], and she doesn't --
like, her face just drops. And she looks at

578
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:06,773
her daughter who's like also got a Western shirt-
[Matt and Bekah laugh] shirt on. It just had

579
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:10,913
this, like sad look of horror as they walk
into this thing, you know? Like, "This

580
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:15,794
is what my daughter is gonna be."
I've -- but anyways, that whole

581
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:19,213
experience has really upsetting.
And, so I'm like -- well, you

582
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:22,903
know, I learned that if you
bought season tickets for like

583
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:29,534
all 90 games in a season, then
you would get like a 15% discount

584
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:33,163
and then I could get the $20
ticket. And so, of course, you know,

585
00:31:33,294 --> 00:31:36,223
what- what's a reasonable thing
to do is spend $9,000 on season

586
00:31:36,223 --> 00:31:39,913
tickets. Yeah. So I basically
took 2/3 of my savings in

587
00:31:39,913 --> 00:31:42,864
my bank account and I funded
the money on season tickets. But

588
00:31:42,864 --> 00:31:47,213
my theory was I could sell them
at face value to my friends. And

589
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:50,124
since I got this like 15%
discount, that would more than

590
00:31:50,124 --> 00:31:53,993
make up for the gap. And- and
Pam and I could go to like three

591
00:31:53,993 --> 00:31:57,114
or four games for free, which is
all I really wanted. And -- but

592
00:31:57,114 --> 00:31:59,273
to do that, I needed to figure
out how to price all these

593
00:31:59,273 --> 00:32:04,148
tickets. And so I wrote a Electron
desktop app that went and scraped

594
00:32:04,148 --> 00:32:06,759
all the data from bluejays.com
and scraped all the data from

595
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:10,868
StubHub, and I wrote an algorithm to
-- it like, you know, if you scrape

596
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:12,848
StubHub one day and you scrape
the next day, you can figure out

597
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,648
what tickets are not there
anymore. And then you can figure

598
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:15,000
out what's sold and for what
price-

599
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Bekah: Oh, wow.

600
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,108
Matt: -since you knew [??] all the things. And so
I built a really nice clean data set, and then I

601
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:23,558
trained an algorithm to price my
tickets. And, you know,

602
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:26,104
again, I have this Electron app
and I just click a button, it'll

603
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:29,614
price on my tickets, send an
email to my friends, and- and then

604
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:34,294
people just earmarked what
tickets I want. And- and it

605
00:32:34,294 --> 00:32:37,594
worked. And I did that for, you
know, I've been doing that for four,

606
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:41,074
five years now, or six years, I
guess. This is -- there's like two

607
00:32:41,074 --> 00:32:43,564
year gap that I, you know,
decided not to do it because of

608
00:32:43,564 --> 00:32:47,824
COVID. And- and then that
got the attention of IBM. I

609
00:32:47,824 --> 00:32:50,854
mean like, "Hey, that's a really
awesome project. And that's what

610
00:32:50,854 --> 00:32:53,739
kind of opened that door." But it
was, you know [laughs], all these --

611
00:32:55,423 --> 00:33:01,094
Bekah: That's -- when I- when I
was leaving education to come into

612
00:33:01,094 --> 00:33:06,673
tech, I made money. I- I remember
the most money I made, I bought and

613
00:33:06,673 --> 00:33:11,693
resold Justin Bieber tickets on StubHub
[Bekah and Matt laugh]. And it was a lot of

614
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:15,683
research. Again, that would have
been something that would have

615
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:17,784
been very useful to me during
that time.

616
00:33:18,189 --> 00:33:18,699
Matt: Oh, yeah.

617
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:22,644
Bekah: Wow, that's amazing. Justin Bieber
also made me a lot of money, so I

618
00:33:22,644 --> 00:33:24,263
don't hate Justin Bieber. He's
great [chuckles].

619
00:33:24,814 --> 00:33:27,334
Matt: He's Canadian, yeah. He's
from down the road there. The --

620
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:28,054
Bekah: That's right [laughs].

621
00:33:28,594 --> 00:33:30,364
Matt: And we have a lot of mixed
feelings about Justin Bieber.

622
00:33:30,364 --> 00:33:35,794
But they're generally positive. He's- he's doing his best
[Matt and Bekah laugh]. I'm glad he did well by you, Bekah.

623
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:35,973
That's good.

624
00:33:37,644 --> 00:33:42,878
Bekah: Yeah. Wow. That -- there ... I
don't know what to say other than that's

625
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:47,288
amazing. And oh, what I did wanna
say was, for -- we have a lot

626
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:50,679
of people who are listening to
the podcast who are coming into

627
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,189
tech, and I really love all these
stories that you're telling,

628
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:58,328
because all of the things that
you made were useful to you and

629
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:01,269
they made sense for you to make.
And so there's always that

630
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:03,578
question of like, "Well, what am
supposed to be doing? And what am

631
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:07,199
I supposed to be building?" And
you- you don't have to build an

632
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:10,498
Electron app that analyzes what to price
your Blue Jays tickets at [laughs],

633
00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:15,418
but like find that thing that's
meaningful and then go for that,

634
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:19,048
and- and see where that takes you,
and who notices you based on that.

635
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:23,179
Matt: Totally. And, you know, I
have a- a friend -- I've- I've had

636
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:26,208
these experiences where I,
you know, while I was at the

637
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:28,818
college, Bekah and Dan, I, you
know, I connected with this group

638
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:32,719
called Hacker Paradise that
facilitates these remote sort of work

639
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,318
experiences. And they were, you know,
it turns out that was really impactful

640
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:40,878
for me. And there's a- a- a woman
I met there who is amazing.

641
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,838
Her name is Nicole Keller and she
has had this really, really cool

642
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:47,028
career path. But one of the
things she was doing down in New

643
00:34:47,028 --> 00:34:50,659
York was running coding classes
for kids. And the thing that I --

644
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:54,498
I brought to visit. Pam and I had gone
to New York and, you know, called up

645
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:56,389
Nicole and then like, "Hey," and she
just like, "Oh, yeah. I'm working.

646
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:58,398
I'm doing this coding class for kids."
And I'm like, "Can we come see?

647
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,639
That sounds awesome." And we went in
and it was like the attic of this

648
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:06,733
church. Like, you know, in- in like
mainland, New York. And we -- so I'm

649
00:35:06,793 --> 00:35:09,224
just going to say mainland New
York. New York island. What is --

650
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:11,000
what are you guys call it [laughs]?
What ... Manhattan! That's it!

651
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Dan: Manhattan. Yes
[Dan and Bekah laugh].

652
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,164
Matt: Yeah. Manhattan. And we [laughs] --
and it was, but like the thing I

653
00:35:18,164 --> 00:35:21,074
loved, Bekah, was that they
started the kids who were -- like,

654
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:22,934
they were just building static
sites and they use like a website

655
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:25,603
builder. They were like as young
as like eight, nine years old,

656
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:30,153
but they started them with --
they had gone to the UN's ... and

657
00:35:30,153 --> 00:35:32,074
I forget what it's called, but
like, basically these are like

658
00:35:32,074 --> 00:35:35,134
our principles, and they had asked
the kids, like, "What's one thing

659
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:37,324
that you'd wanna affect change
with, and let's build a website

660
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:40,864
to do that." Like they- they
started -- they didn't start with

661
00:35:40,923 --> 00:35:44,014
teaching JavaScript or teaching
HTML and CSS. They started with

662
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:45,000
like, what's the change you wanna
see in the world?

663
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

664
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,733
Matt: And how can we use these amazing tools
to do this? And I think that for people

665
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:54,853
who are getting into tech, you
know, it's -- and there's a lot of

666
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:57,704
people that are coming in for
many, many reasons into tech. And

667
00:35:57,704 --> 00:36:00,463
especially now. It's like -- I think
people are realizing that you can

668
00:36:00,463 --> 00:36:02,353
have this great lifestyle with
it, which is wonderful. And

669
00:36:02,353 --> 00:36:04,903
that's a great reason to come into
tech. There- there's these other

670
00:36:04,903 --> 00:36:07,844
things that are connected to it.
I- I think one thing I'd love to

671
00:36:07,844 --> 00:36:13,393
introduce to that sort of, you know,
thought processes, that this is a tremendously

672
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:17,978
powerful thing. You can make computers
do stuff automatically and that's

673
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:21,938
awesome. And it can really affect
positive change on the world. And

674
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:24,909
so, you know, as you're figuring
out what your learning projects are,

675
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,358
think about what you -- like, what you
wanna change about the world. Like,

676
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:31,719
you- you know, can you make something
for your f- your friend group? Can

677
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,608
you make something for yourself?
Can you automate something that

678
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,639
you're doing regularly? Can you
make something that would be just

679
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,329
really funny or cool, you know?
Like- like, what do you wanna make?

680
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:43,748
And- and I think if you start
with that, like, that can be

681
00:36:43,748 --> 00:36:48,204
really powerful. Because, you- you
know, if- if you're self-taught, one of

682
00:36:48,204 --> 00:36:49,853
the biggest challenges you're
gonna face, and one of the

683
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:54,054
biggest challenges I faced is how
do you do it regularly? There

684
00:36:54,054 --> 00:36:58,344
would be weeks I, you know, couldn't bring
myself to have the energy to code at

685
00:36:58,344 --> 00:37:00,773
like 9 o'clock at night,
right? And- and to continue that

686
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:03,983
learning -- learning is so hard.
And it's such an emotionally

687
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:08,003
challenging journey too. But
if you're connected to something

688
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:11,094
that you just wanna see out
there, that- that's a deeper level

689
00:37:11,094 --> 00:37:14,724
of motivation than, you know, than
somebody on one side [??] can be out

690
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:17,304
there. I think that's powerful.

691
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Bekah: Yeah.

692
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:23,818
Dan: Yeah. I- I- I love that a- a lot. And,
you know, and this is -- we actually -- we

693
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:26,789
just released Roger's episode.
We talked to him a couple of

694
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:31,358
weeks ago, and- and he- he said a
lot of the same things. He- he has

695
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:34,898
sort of a -- I mean, not the exact
path, but like self-taught,

696
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:37,869
and- and solving his own
problems, sort of thing, to learn

697
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:41,559
coding. And so, I was -- I'm on
the same boat too. I think my

698
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:46,719
first website ... well, that wasn't
like a GeoCities site, it was like my --

699
00:37:46,949 --> 00:37:49,119
site for my band, right? It
was like in Flash or whatever.

700
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:49,989
Matt: That's awesome.

701
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:56,918
Dan: Just the -- yeah [chuckles]. I
mean, it's fine. But, the- the -- we --

702
00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:00,429
nowadays there's so many learning, like,
opportunities or the bootcamps

703
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:02,768
and everything like that. And
there's so much -- so many

704
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:06,009
different choices to- to make, so many
different paths you can take. And

705
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:10,179
I -- it -- when- when I came up, it's --
there was nothing, you know, nothing

706
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:13,298
like that at all. There was some
books that were out of date as

707
00:38:13,298 --> 00:38:15,909
soon as they hit the shelves and,
you know, and then the internet,

708
00:38:15,938 --> 00:38:20,409
right, and blogs, and- and things
like that. But, I found success the

709
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:25,043
same- the same way it was.
Doing things that like were either

710
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:29,003
fun, or, like, I wanted to fix,
right? And you were tell the story --

711
00:38:29,063 --> 00:38:32,123
w- when you were talking about
the- the automated spreadsheet,

712
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:36,114
the thing that, you know, there- there --
I was thinking in my head, this -- it's

713
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:40,284
like a- a curse and a blessing of-
of people who learn program- like,

714
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,443
once you start down the path,
like once you've figured out some

715
00:38:42,443 --> 00:38:46,373
stuff is that you start seeing this
everywhere. Like, "Oh my god, that --

716
00:38:46,403 --> 00:38:52,074
I could make this easier [chuckles]," right? And
it's like -- and it's- and it's -- when you do it,

717
00:38:52,074 --> 00:38:55,733
it's like a blessing, right? But
it's obviously I have this -- for me

718
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:59,213
anyway, I don't -- maybe this isn't for everybody. But
it- it's like [chuckles], I start to think about it

719
00:38:59,244 --> 00:39:02,603
all the time, for everything. And
sometimes it gets out of hand,

720
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:06,204
sometimes [laughs] I'm automating things
that don't actually take me that

721
00:39:06,204 --> 00:39:09,034
long, probably. It probably the
work is taking longer than it

722
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:14,784
did, but, you know, it's-
it's ... I don't know. It's such

723
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:16,974
a -- once you get into that habit
of thinking that way and like,

724
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:22,284
and the making things it's -- it can be such --
it can- it can improve your life. And like you say,

725
00:39:22,284 --> 00:39:27,594
you can improve- you can improve little annoying
things, or little things, you know, like

726
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:30,414
small things with your family or
your friends, or, you know, large

727
00:39:30,443 --> 00:39:33,054
changes too. And it- it's- it's
cool. Well, there's so many apps, so

728
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:33,864
many possibilities out there.

729
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:36,659
Matt: I mean, are there- are
there any other projects that

730
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:43,708
you've done, Dan, that are, you know, particularly
redundant or [chuckles], maybe like, not the

731
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:47,009
most, you know, effective use of time
or any -- do you [unintelligible] --

732
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:49,228
Dan: Oh, well, I -- how many color lights case
here behind me? [Dan chuckles, Bekah laughs].

733
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,478
Matt: [Laughs] Quite a few actually.

734
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:56,068
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Back in- back in -- I was -- every
time we start -- like, there was a two months or

735
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:59,128
something where I -- so these are all
like hue light bulbs and there's-

736
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:03,369
there's one you can't see too. And
I've spent so much time -- cuz I

737
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:06,039
hated the lights in here. I had --
before these, I just had like

738
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:10,148
lights. Like lamps, everywhere.
And never could get the lighting

739
00:40:10,148 --> 00:40:13,449
right. And then I got these, you
know, so I have -- now I got these

740
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:15,849
hue, I'm like, "This is the
perfect solution. Hue bulbs. Cuz

741
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:17,739
you can connect, you know, you can
connect them with your phone

742
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:21,849
or your, you know, there's probably
a- a web, or a Mac app, and

743
00:40:21,909 --> 00:40:25,509
all that stuff." A-a-and so I replaced
all of [chuckles] the bulbs with these

744
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:28,539
things. And now- now there's too many op-
like, now it's like [Dan and Bekah chuckle]

745
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:31,298
there's too much to do. Like, I can -- I
have too many options. There's too many

746
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:34,869
colors, too many, like, ways. I can
turn them up and down. And also,

747
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:38,994
I -- and I kinda -- exactly how I wanted
it. But then, it was like, okay. Well,

748
00:40:38,994 --> 00:40:42,684
it's still a pain for me to like
open my phone, and like, to push the

749
00:40:42,684 --> 00:40:46,673
button, you know [chuckles]? So it's like,
time to these -- like, time for automations. I

750
00:40:46,673 --> 00:40:50,184
finally bought -- oh, you can't see
it, but I bought -- so, hue has

751
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:53,963
this, like a button that you -- it
is just like a little- a little

752
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:56,393
click button. And you can put it
on the wall, or you can put it

753
00:40:56,393 --> 00:40:59,273
wherever, and you can set that to
do whatever you want, when you

754
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:00,000
click it different ways [laughs].

755
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Matt: Cool.

756
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:08,664
Dan: So I have that on my wall now. So I -- yeah. I-
I spent like five days of- of being happy. I'm- I'm like,

757
00:41:08,664 --> 00:41:11,333
"Huh? This is- this is it. I have
it." And like, just this morning I

758
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:15,344
sat down and I'm like, "I should change the colors of
these lights- these lights [all laughs] right now, but --"

759
00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:22,103
So it was -- I sometimes
struggle with being satisfied

760
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:26,034
with- with things. But, I still --
it is -- it's also fun though, you

761
00:41:26,034 --> 00:41:26,213
know [all laughs]?

762
00:41:28,364 --> 00:41:32,954
Matt: Man, it -- the -- Bekah, you, like, you
have a -- and, you know, Virtual Coffee, I think

763
00:41:32,954 --> 00:41:35,864
it would be totally fair to call
that like a- like an amazing

764
00:41:35,864 --> 00:41:37,844
project that both of you have
created. It's the community I

765
00:41:37,844 --> 00:41:42,253
love and love being part of. And
so, like, does that -- is it sort

766
00:41:42,253 --> 00:41:44,753
of the same sort of thing that
has happened with you, Bekah,

767
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:47,143
where you've had these things that
you've taken on, and you've made, and

768
00:41:47,954 --> 00:41:50,324
resulted in these learning
experiences? And I'd imagine

769
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:52,423
Virtual Coffee has been an amazing
learning experience. Even for yourself [??].

770
00:41:52,628 --> 00:41:56,259
Bekah: Oh, for sure. It's been a
learning experience and it's been

771
00:41:56,259 --> 00:42:00,489
great. I feel like I'm always
dropping things. We have the

772
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:05,619
maintainers channel. And so you --
there- there will be times where

773
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:09,009
I just like drop a bunch of
different ideas. Like, these are

774
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:12,188
all things that I think we should
be doing. And a lot of times,

775
00:42:12,188 --> 00:42:17,259
like I'm writing out all of the
processes or what this means or what

776
00:42:17,259 --> 00:42:20,829
support we need. And then
obviously we don't do all of

777
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:25,389
those because there's only 24 hours
in a day [laughs] and it's just not

778
00:42:25,389 --> 00:42:28,838
possible. But -- and that was like,
I- I got four hours of sleep last

779
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:32,858
night. And it was because last night
before bed, I- I was having this

780
00:42:32,858 --> 00:42:37,628
idea about a tech summit that I
wanted to be doing. And I was like

781
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:41,918
messaging Kirk and Nick Taylor
about that. Like, "Hey, is this a-

782
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:45,579
is this a idea that's too out
there? Or is this something that

783
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:51,344
maybe is useful or good or worth,
like, talking about?" And then I fell

784
00:42:51,344 --> 00:42:54,673
asleep. And then it was like three
in the morning I woke up and my

785
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:56,983
brain was like, "All right. Yeah.
Let's- let's figure this out

786
00:42:56,983 --> 00:43:04,153
right now [laughs]," like, no. But I
feel like, you know, it's a lot of

787
00:43:04,153 --> 00:43:08,143
that, but learning has been
really great. And now I feel like

788
00:43:08,143 --> 00:43:11,804
I'm going down this, I- I don't
like Notion, I have not liked it

789
00:43:11,804 --> 00:43:16,679
anytime I've used it, but like my
methods of storing all of these

790
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:21,628
ideas and writing about them is
just unsatisfactory now. And so

791
00:43:21,628 --> 00:43:25,349
I've started going down the
Notion rabbit hole of like, "This

792
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:28,349
is- this is what I need to do.
And I need to automate these

793
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:33,449
things to my Notion, because I know
that I can." So, I feel like you

794
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:38,278
could probably automate like hi- what
your lights look like through Notion,

795
00:43:38,518 --> 00:43:41,818
right? If you just select what
mood you're in and then it will

796
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:44,994
automatically set your lights. So,
Dan, you should try that [chuckles].

797
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:47,829
Dan: Yeah. Last time I messed with
Notion, I had like a nervous

798
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:50,588
breakdown trying to get
everything exactly like [chuckles] --

799
00:43:51,224 --> 00:43:52,603
Bekah: Kirk is making me a template.
So [chuckles] --

800
00:43:53,753 --> 00:43:57,414
Dan: Yeah. That's the- that's the issue
I have with Notion is- is -- it's

801
00:43:57,414 --> 00:43:59,664
a great product and it's a very,
very cool initiative. There's

802
00:43:59,664 --> 00:44:02,423
just too many possibilities and
it's too pop- it's like possible

803
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:07,253
to get it -- it seems possible to get
it perfect [chuckles]. And it's like,

804
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:11,034
when that- when that, like, perfect
thing gets in my head, it's hard to --

805
00:44:11,094 --> 00:44:12,233
sometimes hard to let it go.
So [chuckles] --

806
00:44:13,409 --> 00:44:16,289
Matt: Yeah. We- we've spent a lot
of time in Notion too. We, you

807
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:19,228
know, it's ... things that are highly
customizable are often not the

808
00:44:19,228 --> 00:44:20,369
best tools, right? Like it's,

809
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:23,248
you know, I appreciate
software that has opinion

810
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:23,668
sometimes.

811
00:44:23,668 --> 00:44:25,000
Bekah: I say that --

812
00:44:23,668 --> 00:44:25,000
Dan: Yeah. My- my -- oh, go
ahead, Bekah.

813
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:29,588
Bekah: It -- my -- right now,
I've just collected way too many

814
00:44:29,588 --> 00:44:33,969
different ways of doing things.
Like, you know, I've got all

815
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:38,798
these apps to help me with
planning or note taking or, you

816
00:44:38,798 --> 00:44:42,458
know, whatev- there's just way too
many of them. So I feel like I'm

817
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:49,239
just very -- all or nothing kind of person.
And so [chuckles] I- I can't have all of

818
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:56,068
these. Now I just need one thing and Notion
is the- the one thing to rule them all up,

819
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:56,619
apparently.

820
00:44:58,353 --> 00:45:01,204
Matt: [Chuckles] And so then, you know,
in -- circling back, like, Bekah, you

821
00:45:01,204 --> 00:45:05,523
have this awesome job. You're an amazing
community manager. Did you have

822
00:45:05,523 --> 00:45:08,403
those skills before you started the Virtual
Coffee, or was that something that you

823
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,364
learned and kind of just figured
out, go into the process?

824
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:17,034
Bekah: When I- when I was in
undergrad, I- I graduated in three

825
00:45:17,034 --> 00:45:19,764
years. So I took a bunch of
credits, but I was also in 10

826
00:45:19,764 --> 00:45:24,893
clubs, and I was an officer in like five
of them [chuckles]. So, I- I feel like

827
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:29,664
it's been a lifelong journey of
community building and many

828
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:35,043
points where I've tried to reject
that. Like, please let me just be in

829
00:45:35,043 --> 00:45:38,853
a hole by myself [chuckles] and not
talk to people. But I keep coming

830
00:45:38,853 --> 00:45:41,614
back to it. I feel like I finally
hit the point where I'm like, "Okay,"

831
00:45:42,454 --> 00:45:47,853
like, "This- this is a skill set I
should utilize it and- and figure out

832
00:45:47,853 --> 00:45:55,353
how I can best do that thing." So,
yeah. It's- it's ... I guess part of

833
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:55,744
me.

834
00:45:57,074 --> 00:46:00,233
Matt: That's really cool. I, you
know, I think that, like, one of the

835
00:46:00,233 --> 00:46:05,143
things that, you know, I was
hard to figure out and I'm- I'm

836
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:07,373
hope I think it's okay. I'm
kind of like left turning the

837
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:09,233
conversation a little bit. One of
the things that was really hard

838
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,423
to figure out in- in running a
business is like, how do you

839
00:46:11,423 --> 00:46:14,873
hire? And you need to figure it
all out from scratch. Because

840
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:17,603
like, we had hired a bunch of
people that make stuff at IBM, but

841
00:46:17,603 --> 00:46:19,554
it was all a very catered
experience. Like we had -- we

842
00:46:19,554 --> 00:46:24,503
outsourced all of the hard out of front work
[??]. And we got these like just like 50

843
00:46:24,503 --> 00:46:27,023
incredible candidates and we
would divide them up on our team

844
00:46:27,023 --> 00:46:28,974
and figure out who's gonna do
round one, round two, round three,

845
00:46:29,063 --> 00:46:32,873
right? And that like,
interviewing is easy, but hiring

846
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,273
is hard. And hiring is all that
other stuff. It's like finding

847
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:37,793
people and evaluating them. And-
and then, you know, you read

848
00:46:37,793 --> 00:46:39,864
about all the bad things that
happen to hiring process, and you

849
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:41,514
don't wanna do those, and you
wanna do the good things, and

850
00:46:41,514 --> 00:46:45,054
you wanna get the right person,
and then the right people. The thing

851
00:46:45,054 --> 00:46:48,313
that has always stand out to me
is personal projects. And it's- it's

852
00:46:48,414 --> 00:46:50,813
probably not surprising given the
history I just described, right?

853
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:53,873
Like, I- like, I value them a lot.
But I think that when somebody

854
00:46:53,873 --> 00:46:57,384
comes in and they say, "Hey, I made
this thing, and here is why I made it,

855
00:46:57,384 --> 00:47:00,954
and here's -- like, how it's
important for like small businesses,

856
00:47:00,954 --> 00:47:06,429
especially," that is so helpful because
it's like, the person's thinking

857
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:10,148
about a need on the other side of
what they're doing. And like, you

858
00:47:10,148 --> 00:47:13,989
know, it- it's -- we don't have like
tickets where we're working through.

859
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:17,079
We're too small. We, you know,
we don't have a ton of process

860
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:20,708
around things. But, like, when people
come in, and then I imagine this is the

861
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:24,489
case for you, Bekah, and you do this
amazing community management, and

862
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:28,239
all this other stuff. And you have Virtual
Coffee as this incredible example

863
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:33,773
of you doing that, in tech, at scale.
And- and I just -- that's awesome.

864
00:47:34,324 --> 00:47:36,753
Bekah: Yeah. I -- and that's
what led to the job that I have

865
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:41,193
right now. I wasn't looking for
work. My team lead reached

866
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:45,094
out to me and it was based on
Virtual Coffee. And somebody else

867
00:47:45,094 --> 00:47:48,543
had — who I'd interviewed
with, who had reached out to me

868
00:47:48,903 --> 00:47:53,333
last summer ... because they
knew about Virtual Coffee —

869
00:47:53,364 --> 00:47:58,014
recommended me. Like, I was on the top
of the -- their list. And so once he

870
00:47:58,014 --> 00:48:01,494
started looking into Virtual
Coffee — I think he watched

871
00:48:01,523 --> 00:48:04,643
some of our Lunch and Learn
videos and read blog posts — like,

872
00:48:04,643 --> 00:48:10,134
there- there is a -- my
community building resume is out

873
00:48:10,134 --> 00:48:15,474
there because of all of the
things that we do. And so, yeah.

874
00:48:15,543 --> 00:48:18,773
It is. It is like a project. I hadn't
really thought about it that way,

875
00:48:18,773 --> 00:48:23,184
but it is this- this living resume
of all of the things that I've

876
00:48:23,184 --> 00:48:23,934
been working on.

877
00:48:24,923 --> 00:48:27,983
Matt: Totally. And- and Dan, watch out.
Cuz, like, Phillips is gonna come

878
00:48:27,983 --> 00:48:31,403
knocking and gonna say, "Hey, [Dan and Bekah laugh] I heard
all these things you're doing with our light bulbs [laughs]."

879
00:48:33,134 --> 00:48:34,123
Dan: Yeah.

880
00:48:34,793 --> 00:48:35,423
Matt: I'm like the CTO.
[Unintelligible] you [laughs].

881
00:48:35,594 --> 00:48:38,994
Dan: And they gonna come and say,
"Hey, buy this product [laughs]. This

882
00:48:38,994 --> 00:48:41,094
product will finally solve all
of your problems."

883
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:44,679
Matt: [Chuckles] Oh my god. Yeah. I hope
all the -- our conversation in this podcast

884
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,378
has an index cuz it'll go to
these Google searches. I mean,

885
00:48:47,378 --> 00:48:49,539
this is gonna be all
Philips hue light bulbs.

886
00:48:49,539 --> 00:48:50,543
Dan: [Laughs] Right.

887
00:48:50,543 --> 00:48:52,574
Bekah: But we are open for
sponsorships, so --

888
00:48:54,423 --> 00:48:54,844
Dan: Yeah. That's right.

889
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,628
Matt: [Unintelligible] Oh my gosh. Yeah.
It's -- that's really interesting. I

890
00:48:58,628 --> 00:49:03,789
think the -- those personal projects,
they- they really standout. And, you

891
00:49:03,789 --> 00:49:06,219
know, and certainly there's
merit, if you're going to a

892
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:08,978
bootcamp and going through that,
you -- like, you wanna stay on task,

893
00:49:08,978 --> 00:49:11,648
right? And if you're gonna get
great learning, great feedback by

894
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,628
building something that it -- like
the bootcamp is saying, "Oh, we're

895
00:49:13,628 --> 00:49:17,259
gonna build like a, you know, shopping
cart," that's totally cool, right? But

896
00:49:17,259 --> 00:49:19,509
those- those other pieces of
like, "Hey, I've got this skill

897
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:23,994
sat down. I can use it to, just, really
do anything I want," it- it is just so

898
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:28,313
attractive to me in a hiring
process. Like, it really separates

899
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:31,373
people out. And I'd imagine
that's been the experience for

900
00:49:31,373 --> 00:49:33,143
both of you from what you've
described too.

901
00:49:33,893 --> 00:49:37,164
Dan: Yeah. And- and like, if you are --
if your only project is coming out of

902
00:49:37,164 --> 00:49:41,213
a bootcamp or what you did in the
bootcamp, and everybody else is trying

903
00:49:41,213 --> 00:49:43,344
to get a job too, you know,
everybody is going to have the

904
00:49:43,344 --> 00:49:46,043
same set of projects, right? And
so, that's- that's another thing

905
00:49:46,074 --> 00:49:49,284
is doing those. And maybe it's --
maybe there's not enough time to

906
00:49:49,284 --> 00:49:51,474
do it while you're in the
bootcamp, you know? Maybe kind of

907
00:49:51,563 --> 00:49:55,853
do it after, but the -- those
personal projects, I- I totally

908
00:49:55,853 --> 00:50:01,434
agree with you, Matt. It- it- it
says- it says so much about ... you

909
00:50:01,434 --> 00:50:03,954
without even speaking [chuckles]. And
then it also gives you something to

910
00:50:03,954 --> 00:50:04,164
talk about, that's easy

911
00:50:04,164 --> 00:50:06,983
to talk about because you
did it and you know- and you

912
00:50:06,983 --> 00:50:12,114
know it. So it's not a theoretical thing
or, you know, school assignment that

913
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:15,233
you weren't connected with, you
know? And it -- and again, it doesn't

914
00:50:15,233 --> 00:50:20,483
have to be world changing or a
successful product or anything like that,

915
00:50:20,483 --> 00:50:23,094
right? You- you were talking
about that Chrome extension that

916
00:50:23,094 --> 00:50:25,523
you made. That's literally just
you and your wife [chuckles], right?

917
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:26,454
Matt: Yeah.

918
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:29,273
Dan: And that- and that's it. Like, but it --
that's- that's- that's a cool project. And I

919
00:50:29,273 --> 00:50:31,523
would like -- like, I enjoyed
hearing about it and I would, if

920
00:50:31,523 --> 00:50:34,344
I was hiring, I would also enjoy
hearing about it. Don't -- you

921
00:50:34,344 --> 00:50:37,253
know, you didn't like sell it to
somebody or, you know, it doesn't have to

922
00:50:37,253 --> 00:50:37,643
be some, I don't know,

923
00:50:38,914 --> 00:50:42,264
huge thing. It's- it's
just a- a thing that you

924
00:50:42,264 --> 00:50:44,903
decided to do on your own, and- and
you figured out how to do it. And

925
00:50:44,903 --> 00:50:45,713
that's- that's the cool part for me.

926
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:51,309
Bekah: We just wrapped up a
hackathon at Deepgram. And one

927
00:50:51,338 --> 00:50:55,539
of our participants had, I think,
five submissions. And this is a month

928
00:50:55,539 --> 00:51:00,938
long hackathon. And the submissions
were all interesting and they

929
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:04,659
were all beautiful. The design
was really great. I'm really

930
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:08,289
terrible at design. And the- the
fact that all of these looked really

931
00:51:08,289 --> 00:51:12,159
wonderful were meaningful, and
interesting projects was great.

932
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:16,268
But I interviewed that
participant for a blog post

933
00:51:16,268 --> 00:51:22,239
highlight. And being able to hear the
stories behind it, to hear how he

934
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:28,369
communicated, what he did, his approach,
how he did it, I -- that's -- he's a

935
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:31,969
person in the top of my book
that I would recommend for a job.

936
00:51:31,998 --> 00:51:35,478
But I know that he's looking and
he's going to be more actively

937
00:51:35,478 --> 00:51:40,969
looking soon. And so when anything
comes up, I know that I'm going

938
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:44,688
to reach out to that person. So, you
know, if it doesn't catch the eye

939
00:51:44,748 --> 00:51:46,009
of somebody who's doing the hiring,

940
00:51:46,009 --> 00:51:49,938
it might catch the eye of somebody
who's in a position where people

941
00:51:49,938 --> 00:51:53,449
reach out to them and say, "Hey, do
you know anybody?" Like, "Yes, I

942
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:55,938
do. This person would be really,
really great for this role."

943
00:51:57,963 --> 00:52:00,693
Matt: Yeah, that's- that's really
interesting. And, you know, and

944
00:52:00,693 --> 00:52:03,603
another sort of related thing
that I hear a lot of hiring

945
00:52:03,603 --> 00:52:06,333
managers articulate, and there's
famous examples of this too, is-

946
00:52:06,753 --> 00:52:10,628
is like a really strong indicator
of success in a businesses or in a

947
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:14,199
particular role is how -- has that
person achieved a success or

948
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:18,759
excellence in a completely
different area, right? And,

949
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,849
you know, the -- Shopify has this
famous example where their CEO

950
00:52:21,849 --> 00:52:24,429
gave an internship or a job to
someone because they are like

951
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:27,000
ranked in the top 50 at StarCraft,
you know?

952
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Dan: That's awesome.

953
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:35,349
Matt: And there's like similar sort of conversation in-
in sales, like, you know, this other sort of area around

954
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:38,378
people who have had a-athletic
success, you know? So there-

955
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:40,748
there are people who are sales
managers, they were like, "Oh, you

956
00:52:40,748 --> 00:52:44,289
were division to athlete and
track?" Like, that's a really

957
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:48,248
strong indicator for this other
type of thing. And I- I think like

958
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:51,159
you also see it in like
volunteers. I'm like -- the stuff

959
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:53,559
you did when we're describing
in university, Bekah. Right?

960
00:52:54,324 --> 00:52:57,083
It's interesting, these signals.
Because the way that we

961
00:52:57,264 --> 00:53:01,434
typically interview is like in front
of a whiteboard [chuckles] and we

962
00:53:01,434 --> 00:53:06,563
just -- we know it's- it's- it's a
hard process to take on anyways.

963
00:53:07,344 --> 00:53:07,733
Ah, all I have to say.

964
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,728
Bekah: Yeah, it is- it is really hard.
And I think even hearing a lot of

965
00:53:12,728 --> 00:53:16,898
conversations around hiring where
people are trying to do things

966
00:53:16,929 --> 00:53:20,648
there -- there's still so much of
the process where we're stuck

967
00:53:20,648 --> 00:53:29,548
inside this box. So, rather than, like,
really trying to ... rethink how we

968
00:53:29,548 --> 00:53:32,518
do the entire process, we're
like, well, we're gonna

969
00:53:32,518 --> 00:53:36,748
rethink, but we still have to do
all of these things. And we have to

970
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:41,548
ask these questions because you have
to [chuckles]. You- you don't have to.

971
00:53:41,548 --> 00:53:45,719
That's not -- what is that, indicating?
And how does that tell you

972
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:48,898
whether or not that's going to be
a good person for you to work

973
00:53:48,898 --> 00:53:53,429
with or a good team for you to join?
How do we rethink the way that

974
00:53:53,429 --> 00:54:01,003
we're ... doing hiring? How we're
onboarding new people? How we are

975
00:54:01,003 --> 00:54:05,474
looking at junior developers in this
hiring process? I can't -- in- in

976
00:54:05,474 --> 00:54:09,014
my mind, it has to be -- there's a
much bigger shift that needs to

977
00:54:09,014 --> 00:54:12,643
happen than, you know, these
tiny changes that we keep seeing

978
00:54:12,643 --> 00:54:13,244
happening.

979
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:18,369
Matt: Yeah. I, you know, I --
there's a part of me that --

980
00:54:18,608 --> 00:54:21,518
And I- I wanna sort of say this
in the, like, the best possible

981
00:54:21,518 --> 00:54:26,798
way that I'm -- I- I wish that people
generally were more deliberate

982
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:30,668
about what they wanted out of a job.
And this has been something that's been

983
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:33,998
incredibly important for me. And,
you know, there's these books

984
00:54:33,998 --> 00:54:36,458
that like, sort of get you
thinking on these topics, but

985
00:54:37,224 --> 00:54:41,063
like, really early on, for me, was
it -- that- that juncture where I'm

986
00:54:41,063 --> 00:54:44,364
like, oh, like a career in tech in-
in -- specifically, there's a shift I

987
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,483
had, you know, a couple of years
after learning code where I -- I've

988
00:54:47,543 --> 00:54:50,634
very deliberately, I wanna run
a business. I- I wanna run a

989
00:54:50,634 --> 00:54:53,123
technology based business. And
that wasn't for the sake of

990
00:54:53,184 --> 00:54:55,523
wanting to do that. It was
because of these other things

991
00:54:55,523 --> 00:54:58,043
that I wanted. I sat -- literally
had a moment where I sat down and I

992
00:54:58,043 --> 00:55:02,554
say, "What do I wanted in my
work life?" And, you know, for me,

993
00:55:02,554 --> 00:55:04,744
they were things that were
connected to autonomy. I wanted,

994
00:55:04,983 --> 00:55:08,134
like, in a perfect world, I would
work where and when I wanted to.

995
00:55:08,134 --> 00:55:11,284
I would -- like, I- I ne- was always
confused that we had this like 40

996
00:55:11,284 --> 00:55:14,784
hour a week box that we often live
in. Like, why does that- why does

997
00:55:14,784 --> 00:55:17,844
that have to exist, you know?
Like, what are the reasons that

998
00:55:17,844 --> 00:55:22,074
the edges of that box are there?
And like, I -- what if one week I

999
00:55:22,074 --> 00:55:25,403
wanna work less? And one week I
wanted that type of control to,

1000
00:55:25,884 --> 00:55:29,483
you know, there were these -- I-
I wanted to work on any type of

1001
00:55:29,483 --> 00:55:32,693
problem that I wanted. I- I wanted
to have the potential for

1002
00:55:32,693 --> 00:55:36,293
financial independence, you
know, these types of things. And

1003
00:55:36,344 --> 00:55:40,403
that put like, you know, to me,
that was really helpful because

1004
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:43,344
it determined the types of jobs that
I wanted to work at and- and why.

1005
00:55:43,824 --> 00:55:46,643
And so when I started applying to --
and I -- like, I think I applied

1006
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:50,784
to, you know, putting IBM and Microsoft
aside because I- I never actually put an

1007
00:55:50,784 --> 00:55:56,724
application into either company. It --
they -- like, once you get in, it -- I

1008
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:59,813
just wanna go there, but it's
a different process. And -- but

1009
00:55:59,813 --> 00:56:02,153
I did apply to two technology
companies to be a programmer. And

1010
00:56:02,244 --> 00:56:04,994
that -- my purpose in applying to
them was, you know, the- the

1011
00:56:05,003 --> 00:56:07,434
conventional wisdom that working
at a startup will help you do a

1012
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:10,434
startup later. And that's what I
wanted. I wanted to run my own

1013
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:12,713
business. So I was applying to a
very particular type of company

1014
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:16,344
because the purpose of that
learning was to help me do this

1015
00:56:16,344 --> 00:56:20,273
thing later. And you know, the
funny thing about people who are

1016
00:56:20,304 --> 00:56:23,873
junior devel- developers and
who are graduating like in 2022,

1017
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:26,153
is in a very short period of
time, they're the hiring managers.

1018
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:32,688
And, you know, I -- like, I -- my
gut feeling is that if people were

1019
00:56:32,688 --> 00:56:36,679
approaching that process with
like a very deliberate set of

1020
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:40,489
values and intentions, that
hiring would change on the

1021
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:44,748
back end, later. Or maybe not,
you know? [Laughs]

1022
00:56:48,969 --> 00:56:50,708
Bekah: Yeah, that's interesting.
I hadn't really thought about

1023
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:55,958
that. And it- and it can be really
hard, especially with so many people

1024
00:56:55,989 --> 00:57:00,548
looking for jobs on the market right
now. And -- I knew that I spent a lot

1025
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:05,079
of time telling people, when you
join your first team, it should

1026
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:09,849
be about the people, and not the
project. Because I've seen so many

1027
00:57:09,849 --> 00:57:14,139
people jump into, I -- particularly
EdTech companies. I don't know.

1028
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:19,778
I just -- generally EdTech,
that's really toxic or what, but just

1029
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:25,028
really bad experiences. And there's been
the whole like mission trade-off thing.

1030
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:30,923
"Well," you know, "We've got a great
mission." Well, but you're doing a

1031
00:57:30,923 --> 00:57:35,003
terrible job of managing a team, being
kind to other people [chuckles], you

1032
00:57:35,003 --> 00:57:37,253
know? Like, those things matter.

1033
00:57:38,403 --> 00:57:42,693
Matt: Yeah. You know, I- I -- if I was, you
know, the key -- talk about EdTech and I

1034
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:45,094
completely echo that sentiment, I
think it's totally correct. And video-

1035
00:57:45,153 --> 00:57:46,000
video game industry is notorious, right?

1036
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Bekah: Yeah.

1037
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:53,978
Matt: For -- like it's not being a great place to work.
If there was one thing that I learned working in big tech,

1038
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:57,759
like, you know, going from a
college where you're, you know, you,

1039
00:57:57,789 --> 00:58:00,398
like, you make this amount of
money, you need a $1,500 raise a

1040
00:58:00,398 --> 00:58:04,358
year, and it's unionized, and X and
Y and Z. And then, like, I remember

1041
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:09,079
the week that I joined IBM, they, like,
flew me down to Silicon Valley for two

1042
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:12,349
weeks. We had this -- then we had
like this event. And there was like

1043
00:58:12,498 --> 00:58:15,528
this music, and it was just all
catered, and it was all free, and

1044
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:19,969
it was crazy, the amount of money.
And I got the opportunity to work

1045
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:22,668
with you. It was a really great.
I loved both of those jobs.

1046
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:26,298
Loved, loved, loved both of them.
And I think one of the things

1047
00:58:26,298 --> 00:58:29,329
that I've learned is that a lot
of the things that we want in an

1048
00:58:29,329 --> 00:58:33,443
employer, a really, really strong
indicator is the health of the

1049
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:37,344
business. If you wanna- if- if
you wanna work, you know, my- my

1050
00:58:37,403 --> 00:58:42,264
wife works at Shopify. She loves it there.
And, you know, they have --  Shopify makes

1051
00:58:42,264 --> 00:58:45,623
so much money that they can hire
people, that all they do is think

1052
00:58:45,623 --> 00:58:48,204
about diversity and equity. And
they hire another -- they have a

1053
00:58:48,204 --> 00:58:51,023
whole team that all they do is
think about culture. And they have

1054
00:58:51,023 --> 00:58:54,534
whole teams that do all -- do
nothing but, you know, run an

1055
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:58,509
internal events and try to make
that a great place to work, you

1056
00:58:58,509 --> 00:59:01,000
know? You can do that if
you've got a ton of money.

1057
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

1058
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,869
Matt: And, you know, in terms of diversity
in tech, my AI team at Microsoft, we were

1059
00:59:08,018 --> 00:59:10,329
extremely diverse by every
standard. We had more women than

1060
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:15,248
men, and- and that's an AI where -- like,
its AI and data science is enormously

1061
00:59:15,248 --> 00:59:17,378
behind computer science. It's
where computer science was like

1062
00:59:17,378 --> 00:59:22,509
15 years ago. But we were able to
have a diverse team at Microsoft

1063
00:59:22,509 --> 00:59:27,878
because we could outbid everybody, you
know? We- we could go hire the best and the

1064
00:59:27,878 --> 00:59:32,318
best one are to work for us. And we
can afford it. And there's a million

1065
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:36,668
other examples like that. So, it's
like, I think going full circle,

1066
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:39,699
a lot of EdTech can be a really
tough place to work because

1067
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,000
that's a really, really hard
business to be in.

1068
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

1069
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,918
Matt: And you're- you're pinching every corner.
And usually, you are. And same with the video game

1070
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:51,338
industry is it is like, you know,
if that game does well,

1071
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:55,358
congratulations. But if it doesn't, you --
it -- like, it's really -- it's a tough

1072
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:59,043
environment to work in. So,
you know, if you wanna have a

1073
00:59:59,043 --> 01:00:01,503
really great place to work, I
think the best, most simple

1074
01:00:01,503 --> 01:00:04,324
indicator you can look at is like
how much money did they raise in

1075
01:00:04,324 --> 01:00:07,264
the last round, if it's a
startup. If it's a publicly -- big

1076
01:00:07,264 --> 01:00:09,454
publicly traded company, is it
growing? Look at their stock

1077
01:00:09,454 --> 01:00:12,784
chart for five years. Does it go
up? You know, if it does, probably

1078
01:00:12,784 --> 01:00:16,173
a great place to work. If it's flat,
it- it, you know, you might be getting

1079
01:00:16,684 --> 01:00:18,903
like -- you might not have budget
to go to that next conference.

1080
01:00:18,963 --> 01:00:22,474
It's ... you know. And similarly,
people might not be attracted to

1081
01:00:22,474 --> 01:00:23,164
work there in the same.

1082
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,201
Bekah: Yeah, I think that's
great advice. I wanna thank you

1083
01:00:27,201 --> 01:00:29,601
so much for being here with us
today and having this

1084
01:00:29,601 --> 01:00:33,590
conversation. There's a lot of
really great takeaway cuz I feel like

1085
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:36,860
from all these stuff that we
talked about here. Is there

1086
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:40,670
anything that you wanna share
before we leave or any last words

1087
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,050
of wisdom for our listeners?

1088
01:00:42,596 --> 01:00:45,476
Matt: No. Thanks everyone. The --
thank you, Bekah and Dan, for having me.

1089
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:48,235
It's- it's great. If nothing else,
I think one of the things we all

1090
01:00:48,235 --> 01:00:51,385
take away from today is build
personal projects. Go make stuff.

1091
01:00:51,536 --> 01:00:54,925
Like, you know, the- the old Y-Com
motto, make- make stuff people

1092
01:00:54,925 --> 01:00:56,396
want, right? Make stuff you want.

1093
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Bekah: Yeah.  

1094
01:00:56,501 --> 01:00:56,800
Dan: Yeah.

1095
01:00:56,846 --> 01:00:57,326
Matt: It's cool. And share it --

1096
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:58,501
Bekah: Share with us too. We
wanna see 'em.

1097
01:00:59,036 --> 01:01:00,896
Matt: Yeah, totally. Thank you
so much for having me.

1098
01:01:01,001 --> 01:01:03,000
Dan: Thanks, Matt. This is
awesome.

1099
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Bekah: Bye.
