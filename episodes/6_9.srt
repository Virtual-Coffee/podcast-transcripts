00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:07,972
Bekah: Hello and welcome to
Season 6, Episode 9 of the

2
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:11,723
Virtual Coffee Podcast. We are
live because this is our season

3
00:00:11,723 --> 00:00:16,132
finale and we are very excited to
be here with you. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:16,463 --> 00:00:20,062
is a group of developers at all
stages of their coding journey,

5
00:00:20,242 --> 00:00:22,402
and they're here on this podcast
sharing their stories and what

6
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:25,103
they've learned. But really it's
the last episode of the season.

7
00:00:25,103 --> 00:00:29,062
And so it is the three of us
sharing our stories and what

8
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:35,362
we've learned. So, we'll do
an intro question in a second,

9
00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:40,552
but do you want to, does
anybody wanna give us an intro

10
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:45,063
question? Hey, Deborah-Kaye!

11
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:50,603
Kirk: Do you want to use the
one from VC? Oh, that might be a

12
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:55,192
spoiler for when this was done,
but like today Oh, I didn't hear

13
00:00:55,313 --> 00:00:57,442
dance cause he wasn't in my room
and I don't think he could make

14
00:00:57,442 --> 00:01:02,302
it. So the question is, do
you like sour? And if you do,

15
00:01:02,332 --> 00:01:05,362
what is your favorite sour food?
And Bekah is already making faces

16
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:05,813
so.

17
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:10,808
Bekah: name's Bekah. I'm a
technical community builder from

18
00:01:10,808 --> 00:01:15,608
a small town in Ohio, and sour is
the worst. Like I am pretty open

19
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:20,947
about different tastes, but I
draw the line at sour it. If I

20
00:01:20,977 --> 00:01:26,647
drink like any kind of sour beer,
I immediately have heartburn and

21
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:30,668
sour just makes your face go
like, and that means it's bad, so

22
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:34,028
hard. Pass on sour. I will take
bitter all day long.

23
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:42,082
Dan: Alright. Hi, I am Dan. I
do computer things in Cleveland

24
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:49,222
and I don't judge. Foods
based on facial expressions, You

25
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:54,533
know, in general, I, I, I
like, I like some sour things.

26
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:56,992
You know, I, I definitely like a
little bit of sour in a lot of

27
00:01:56,998 --> 00:02:00,233
things, you know? I, like, we had
tacos the night, squeeze the line

28
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,722
lime on top of the chicken,
really, really good. It doesn't

29
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,703
make like the whole taco taste
sour, you know what I mean? But

30
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,212
it's just like that

31
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:08,758
Bekah: Well, I like citrus that
doesn't really count as sour.

32
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:11,902
Dan: I, Okay. I mean, like, it's,
it's just like a little touch of

33
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:14,002
it, you know what I mean? That's,
that's what I mean. But I don't

34
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:17,423
like, like I, I, I was saying
this in, in the room, I, you

35
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:20,152
know, I'll eat like a, like a
sour patch kids, you know, for

36
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:23,483
instance, which is like, sort of
sour. It's mostly sugar anyway,

37
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:27,173
but like, definitely my last
choice of, of, from the

38
00:02:27,173 --> 00:02:29,693
Halloween bucket that my kids
always have full of candy somehow

39
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:35,872
all year round, so yeah,
that's, that's my answer. I'm

40
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:39,772
ambivalent. Citrus, I'm a
huge fan of, and I think sour is

41
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:42,953
part of the citrus thing, you
know? So I can't just say I don't

42
00:02:42,953 --> 00:02:43,133
like

43
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:44,487
Bekah: because I love citrus.

44
00:02:46,538 --> 00:02:50,687
Dan: Fair enough. What up, Kirk?

45
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:53,388
Kirk: I have, I have a lot you've
been saying. So, Okay. So first

46
00:02:53,388 --> 00:02:55,638
of all, first of all, my name is
Kirk. Let's just get outta the

47
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:58,997
way. That's not, that's
irrelevant at the moment. In

48
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:02,897
our room, immediately we get the
discussion of does citrus count?

49
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:08,693
And I said, yes, because. I'm
gonna say this thing that I hate,

50
00:03:08,842 --> 00:03:12,383
I don't want to yuck anyone's
yum. Which now also feels like a

51
00:03:12,383 --> 00:03:12,622
sour

52
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:15,247
Dan: Didn't, Didn't we make a
rule that you weren't allowed to

53
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:15,997
say that anymore?

54
00:03:17,473 --> 00:03:21,443
Kirk: That was so long ago. You
know? But

55
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:23,437
Dan: to be one of the worst
phrases in the entire world.

56
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:28,612
Kirk: but also like everything
you said about why you don't

57
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:32,978
like, like I, I want sour things
like once a. And when I eat, I do

58
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:36,187
make the faces of like a baby
when they're given. Like I do all

59
00:03:36,187 --> 00:03:38,527
of, I can't help it. And then
everyone around me just laughs at

60
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:42,247
my face. Like I just fully lean
into that. You know, it's like

61
00:03:42,252 --> 00:03:45,038
those old lemon drop candies.
Like I just, I do it and then,

62
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:49,987
you know, like my soul just like
shutters and then it's great.

63
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:51,907
But it's like pepper, right? Like
we're not supposed to eat.

64
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:57,893
Pepper, Right? Like peppers want,
like birds. Birds can't. Birds

65
00:03:57,893 --> 00:04:01,823
don't care about capsaicin. So
plants made spicy so that mammals

66
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:05,002
wouldn't eat the food. Birds lead
the food cuz birds travel farther

67
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:09,348
and distribute the seeds farther,
Like. When they poop. But like

68
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:12,228
humans or mammals we're just
like, Hey, this like hurts. But

69
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:16,367
I'm kind of into it and that's
why we're already doing stuff

70
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:18,827
that we're not supposed to be
doing. Right. Like sours supposed

71
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:22,608
to be like, this is probably not
meant to be consumed, as is

72
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:25,877
bitter. But here we are. So just
lean into it. It's bad because

73
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:31,367
it's good. It's bad cuz it's
good. Put it on a t-shirt. That's

74
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:31,937
my intro.

75
00:04:33,778 --> 00:04:39,338
Bekah: I've never heard anyone
say it that way. And also I will

76
00:04:39,338 --> 00:04:45,067
do what I want with this stream
because I have the power. If

77
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:48,038
you're listening, I discovered
that I can change the way things

78
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,317
look, and this is going to be
fun.

79
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:51,502
Kirk: This is what?

80
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:53,507
Dan: Mm. That's great.

81
00:04:54,247 --> 00:04:59,108
Bekah: So welcome everybody to
this live podcast. Thanks for

82
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:02,557
all those who are joining us
live. If you have a question or

83
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:06,427
if you have a topic that you want
to hear us talk about, go ahead

84
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:10,237
and put that in the chat and
we'll do an excellent job of

85
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:12,127
keeping up with it at all times,

86
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,708
Dan: We promise

87
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:20,947
Bekah: All right, why don't we
get started with what's going on

88
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:28,028
now at Virtual Coffee? So, so Dan
is in his pumpkin jacket, so I

89
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:31,298
think it's appropriate if he
starts this conversation,

90
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:37,312
Dan: Hello, my name is Daniel t
Pumpkins. Yes, I've, I've

91
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:42,023
started referring to this as my,
my pumpkin regalia. I don't know

92
00:05:42,028 --> 00:05:45,353
if I'm using that correctly, but,
Oh, we lost Kirk. He'll be back.

93
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:49,822
Oh, there he is. I don't know
where he went, but he's back.

94
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:53,002
Hello. So,

95
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:54,225
Kirk: internet has been

96
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:57,442
Dan: all right, well, hopefully
we don't lose you for good.

97
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:01,762
You're back for now. What is,
oh, what is going on in Virtual

98
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:05,723
Coffee right now? It's
Hacktoberfest. And so we've

99
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:08,752
mentioned this a couple times on,
I don't know if we've mentioned

100
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:11,362
it recently on the pod. We've
been talking about it a lot in

101
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:14,872
Virtual Coffee. So
Hacktoberfest is a month long

102
00:06:15,502 --> 00:06:18,682
sort of celebration of open
source, right? And, it.

103
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:22,958
Originally it's, I mean,
originally and still is run by a

104
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,408
company called Digital Ocean, and
they do a monthly thing every

105
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:31,898
year. And, the object is
really, so for, contributors

106
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:37,358
to submit four, poll requests
in the month of October and have

107
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:39,548
them accepted, you know,
hopefully. And, if you can

108
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:41,978
hit that goal, then they, you
know, celebrate you and usually

109
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:45,517
send some swagger or something
like that as well. And, they

110
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:48,127
do a really good job of doing
this and providing a lot of

111
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:51,548
resources for contributors and a
lot of resources for, open

112
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:55,367
source maintainers and things
like that. And so we, couple

113
00:06:55,507 --> 00:06:59,918
years ago decided to,
piggyback on that and basically

114
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,007
help our idea two years, three
years ago, was to help our

115
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:06,968
members get, you know, get the,
the Hacktoberfest

116
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:11,137
accomplished, you know, And
so that was, yeah, that was three

117
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:13,358
years ago. We did this the first
time in Virtual Coffee and we had

118
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:15,848
a lot of fun. And last year we
had, a huge number of people.

119
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:19,612
Join us and contribute a whole
bunch of awesome things to open

120
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:23,723
source projects. And, we're
doing it again. And so we have

121
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:27,142
add Virtual Coffee. We have a
Hacktoberfest, you know, room

122
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:30,562
where we have been chatting and
sharing lots of like, open issues

123
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:34,642
and, you know, providing help
and support for people. And we

124
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:37,822
have the Hack Hector Coworking
room, which is a special version

125
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:42,233
of our coworking room. You
know, for people who are

126
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:49,463
Hacktoberfestering and, yes,
that's the word. And, what

127
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:50,752
else's going on? Heto

128
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,202
Bekah: it's just "festing".
You're just "festing"

129
00:07:53,202 --> 00:07:54,413
Hacktoberfesting.

130
00:07:55,552 --> 00:07:59,093
Dan: I'm Hacktoberfestering. And
that's, Listen, who has the

131
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:09,442
jacket? Okay. me, And so I make
the rules and I, you know,

132
00:08:09,892 --> 00:08:14,723
all decisions come through this
jacket.

133
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:18,005
Kirk: When you invited me to this
podcast, I thought I was coming

134
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:21,875
up here as a creative consultant.
So to hear this now was really,

135
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:23,196
uh,

136
00:08:23,572 --> 00:08:27,382
Dan: Well, you know, what are you
gonna do,

137
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:28,266
Kirk: executive producer.

138
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:34,462
Dan: And so we're halfway, almost
halfway through October, and, you

139
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:37,552
know, we've had, I know a lot of
our members have been doing some

140
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:41,722
contributions. We have our
traditional issue on the Virtual

141
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,863
Coffee site that people can
complete to, you know, get one,

142
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:51,023
one of their poll requests in
to start us off. We have some

143
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:56,182
videos on our site for some of
our Hacktoberfest, things

144
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:59,663
that we've done so far this
month. And, yeah. Did I miss

145
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:01,673
anything about current event?

146
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:06,248
Bekah: Julia put in the chat. Dan
makes the rules. Bekah controls

147
00:09:06,248 --> 00:09:08,898
the settings, and Kirk is an
unwitting victim. Again,

148
00:09:12,758 --> 00:09:15,758
Dan: Sorry, not sorry. Yeah,
that's the,

149
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:20,541
Kirk: No, No. That captures our
dynamic pretty well. Julie is

150
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,740
right. She's insightful.

151
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:25,418
Bekah: don't know. I feel like
I'm gonna push back a little bit

152
00:09:25,423 --> 00:09:26,827
against Dan makes the rules.

153
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:31,268
Dan: I mean, you can push back
all you want, but still I have

154
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:33,967
the jacket and so what are you
gonna do?

155
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:41,092
Bekah: I, this is, this is how my
criminal story starts. I will

156
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:46,013
come and take the jacket, if
that's where the power is. I will

157
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:47,302
acquire the jacket.

158
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:52,625
Kirk: Before you came on the
stream back, I was saying like

159
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:55,806
Dan in that jacket. I dunno if
anybody remembers like the

160
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:56,533
Bekah: Yes.

161
00:09:57,035 --> 00:10:00,635
Kirk: It's, you know, Stanley, I
kiss. It's a similar sort of, you

162
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:03,995
know, there's this garment in
beauty of chaos and then he knows

163
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:07,745
he's not supposed to put it on,
but he does. Then he becomes this

164
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:11,916
entity, you know, And then we
just all have to deal with it

165
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:17,020
until the jacket comes. It's like
the Hulk, but for Hacktoberfest,

166
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,291
The Hulk Tober

167
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:19,373
Dan: I feel like Hulk

168
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:20,523
Bekah: Hulktoberfestering?

169
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,572
Dan: Loses clothes as he turns
into Hulk though, you know? So

170
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:25,020
Kirk: That's true.

171
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:28,072
Bekah: So the anti Hulk.

172
00:10:28,403 --> 00:10:34,013
Dan: No, I'm not anti hok. I
love Hulk. Also shout she,

173
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:36,743
She-Hulk has been really awesome
too. So,

174
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:38,998
Bekah: That's exactly right. Tom
Cudd

175
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:45,442
Dan: Yes, Tom Cudd. And, yes.
So, Oh, Tom, I saw that you

176
00:10:45,472 --> 00:10:48,847
followed us. Twitch, I think, I
think I get emails for some

177
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:50,857
reason every time somebody
follows us. So if you haven't

178
00:10:50,857 --> 00:10:52,717
followed us on Twitch, please do.
If you haven't followed our

179
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:56,107

link on our site, Virtual

180
00:10:56,107 --> 00:11:01,418

Twitter too. Oh, slash podcast.

181
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:03,697
Yeah, there's links, but yes
slash podcast if you wanna go

182
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:08,408
right there. We have a bunch
of people in the chat that we've

183
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:11,738
actually talked to on the Virtual
Coffee podcast, so that's kind of

184
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:12,118
exciting.

185
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:16,087
Bekah: Yeah. And some of our
maintainers are here as well. And

186
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:22,278
contributors for Hacktoberfest.
So how's everyone's Hacktoberfest

187
00:11:22,302 --> 00:11:26,248
going? Kirk, are you
Hacktoberfesting?

188
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:34,160
Kirk: I am Hacktoberfesting
in the way, and maybe this is

189
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:38,105
really relevant. I guess you've
had three Hacktoberfests before.

190
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:42,125
I had one where I was a
maintainer and that was super

191
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,616
cool. And I have one where I was
just a contributor and that was

192
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,926
also super cool. And this time I
feel like most of what I'm doing

193
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:53,046
has been mentoring and that has
also been super cool. So I'm

194
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,586
really, you know, I'm doing all
the things. I'm the real, I'm

195
00:11:56,586 --> 00:11:59,436
getting the full experience just
spread across three years and

196
00:11:59,436 --> 00:12:01,235
that's like totally okay. Right.
Which I feel like has been the

197
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:04,505
real. It's always sort of the
theme of Hacktoberfest, but

198
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:07,206
especially this time, you know,
like people are like, What do I

199
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:10,475
do? Or How come like it's, you
can do whatever you're

200
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:13,836
comfortable with or whatever you
want. Or like, if you do wanna

201
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:17,436
get outside of your comfort zone,
you know, like there's a

202
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,975
difference between stepping
outside your boundaries or

203
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:24,336
pushing your boundaries and like
jumping far away from it. Don't,

204
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:27,995
don't do that, but you know, if
you can find a little way to move

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,655
it, then I think it's been really
good. It's been really. I'm

206
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:35,572
Bekah: like I take the opposite
approach where I'm very resistant

207
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:39,533
to doing many of the things in
Hacktoberfest and then like two

208
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:44,572
days before I suddenly decide I'm
going to do all of the things,

209
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:48,052
Let's start new projects, let's
resurrect projects I haven't

210
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:53,332
worked on in a year. Let's
mentor, let's contribute. I'm not

211
00:12:53,332 --> 00:13:01,043
really sure why, but I can't help
it. I just, I, I can't not do the

212
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:04,072
things cuz they're just, they
look so exciting.

213
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:09,562
Dan: Yeah, and I like, I, I'm
kind of with that too. One of the

214
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:12,832
things is, one of the things I
like about this is that it,

215
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:16,613
well, helps me, you know, having
like a date that a thing needs to

216
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:19,972
be done by or whatever helps me
do it. And that includes like

217
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:22,793
making a bunch of issues for the
re for the Virtual Coffee site

218
00:13:22,793 --> 00:13:25,192
for instance. You know, I, I, I
know in my head a bunch of things

219
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:28,192
that need to be done and we can
use for an help on, it always

220
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:30,623
takes time and a little bit of
like, mental energy to write

221
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:33,712
those issues and, and so
sometimes they just, like, I

222
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,113
just, they get put on the back
burner. But since we had

223
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:39,562
Hacktoberfest coming up, it
was a really good time to, you

224
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:42,352
know, put some effort into doing
that and, and creating those

225
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:44,572
issues. And it's been really
awesome having people, having

226
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:49,673
people, contribute back to
the site, you know? And we,

227
00:13:49,673 --> 00:13:54,173
we always have some contributors
throughout the year. But it,

228
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:56,932
it's, I dunno, it's been,
it's been fun having a bunch of

229
00:13:56,932 --> 00:13:59,663
different people and all that,
like, shook kind of goes to show

230
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:04,163
like creating, create the issues
and probably people will come and

231
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:06,322
help out, you know, as a
maintainer, you know what I mean?

232
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:10,043
It's, it's like, One of those
things where, we now have a

233
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:12,052
bunch, I mean, there, there's
the, the member issue that

234
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:14,212
everybody, all of our Virtual
Coffee members are welcome to

235
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:19,763
like do, but the features and
stuff, it's, it's, you know, they

236
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:23,123
need to have the, the, the
options to work on, to do the

237
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:26,722
work, you know? And so it's been
really fun, kind of doing

238
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:29,243
back and forth with people and,
and getting some new stuff going.

239
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,743
So I've been enjoying that a lot.

240
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:35,888
Bekah: Tom says, It sounds like
we're learning from the current

241
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:40,148
Virtual Coffee book club start
finishing, which I wanted to get,

242
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:42,847
but I couldn't get in an audio
book format and I knew if I

243
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:46,748
ordered a hard copy, it would sit
with all the piles of hard copies

244
00:14:46,748 --> 00:14:50,557
of books that I have yet to read.

245
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:52,582
Dan: Yeah. I need to

246
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,600
Kirk: have it in, That's the,
that's the only way I could

247
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,301
figure out how to read. But I did
find an audiobook format and it

248
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:00,260
is really good

249
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:01,432
Dan: Nice.

250
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:08,197
Bekah: I see. I don't have
Audible or understand how to use

251
00:15:08,197 --> 00:15:12,337
Audible, so I don't audible
things.

252
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:15,793
Dan: What

253
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:16,890
Kirk: Bekah.

254
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:18,863
Dan: call

255
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:21,847
Bekah: Audible. Well cuz you have
to like sign up for Audible,

256
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:25,177
Right. And then you pay money for
Audible and then you have to pay

257
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:27,668
money for the books too, right?

258
00:15:28,523 --> 00:15:33,082
Dan: Yeah. You get one free,
month, pretty sure. And then

259
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:33,383
you can

260
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,721
Kirk: Yeah, like your book token,
and you can like, Hey, here's

261
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:41,630
this token. Give a book. And if
you don't use your token for the

262
00:15:41,635 --> 00:15:46,100
month, like stack up. And if you
want more, more. than the token,

263
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,431
then you,

264
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:48,278
Bekah: pay for them.

265
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:52,852
Dan: Yeah. But you pay for
tokens. So all books cost the

266
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:56,602
same amount. It's one token
Anyway, this is our audible

267
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:56,873
corner

268
00:15:58,268 --> 00:16:01,597
Bekah: We are not sponsored by
Audible. We won't

269
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,541
Kirk: If you'd like

270
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:04,538
Bekah: I'll never be sponsored by
Audible

271
00:16:05,677 --> 00:16:06,217
Dan: My gosh,

272
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,260
Kirk: any of the podcast
sponsors, you know, if you, if

273
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:19,530
you sell mattresses or shaving
stuff, or

274
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:22,523
Bekah: Therapy. That's on all of
my True Crime podcasts.

275
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,571
Kirk: dog, if you're listening,
if you're listening, Datadog.

276
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:36,216
Listen, we're we are, we are
ready. Yeah, no, but, the

277
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:42,875
book just to say like, I've been,
the, the process of making, and

278
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,456
we talk about this a lot, like
the process of making or ready

279
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:51,155
for contributions is a dance like
it's non. Evergreen chat out

280
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:54,125
to Nick Taylor. I love Nick
Taylor's been super active in

281
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:58,176
Theto channel and he in year and
have their project that they've

282
00:16:58,176 --> 00:17:00,605
been working on, but I also
really appreciate how like as

283
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,765
soon as Nick sort of like spots
something's wrong, I feel like

284
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,016
he's like, Yeah, I should just
turn this into an issue. And he

285
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:10,355
just like, does it. And I feel
like part of, I probably. Make

286
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:12,546
things more than they need to. In
my head, I feel like I need to

287
00:17:12,546 --> 00:17:15,246
craft like the perfect issue
every time. And I feel like he's

288
00:17:15,246 --> 00:17:18,066
willing to just, Well, I'll get
it up there. If I need to fix it,

289
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:20,286
I'll fix it later. But it's
there. And it's like, yeah, you

290
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:24,365
can grab this if you want.
And it may end up being that he

291
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:27,425
was, the maintainer might end up
doing this thing, but it's like

292
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:32,465
you gave people a chance, like
try It I don't know. That

293
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:38,076
sort of ties into one of the
aspects of having an open source

294
00:17:38,076 --> 00:17:42,486
repo is like that willingness to
let go. Like I have to let other

295
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:47,316
people sort of like be a part of
this thing and they don't think

296
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,346
like me and like I can put stuff
in an issue, but at the end of

297
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:52,715
the day, like they're the ones
figuring it out. And you sort of

298
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:55,566
have to be okay with that. And I
think, if you're somebody who

299
00:17:55,566 --> 00:18:01,566
has, I wouldn't. Issues is weird.
If you have difficulties of sort

300
00:18:01,736 --> 00:18:04,685
of like letting go of certain
things, like making it open

301
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:08,076
source is a great way to realize
like, Oh, I can't pour this cuz

302
00:18:08,076 --> 00:18:11,766
I'll like, I'll stress myself
out. You sort have to kind of set

303
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:14,586
a tree and let it be a community
thing, an organic thing. And I, I

304
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,705
really like seeing like the
virtual I website. Like I really

305
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:20,885
say, Oh yeah, a bunch of people
have like helped make this what

306
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:21,726
it is and it's really cool.

307
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:23,959
Dan: It is really cool

308
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,413
Bekah: I think, you know, the
idea of letting it go and putting

309
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:34,084
it out there is a really good
one. Because I think too, like

310
00:18:34,084 --> 00:18:38,074
sometimes as a maintainer or
somebody who's been working on a

311
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:41,104
project, you might get stuck on
an idea and somebody might come

312
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:43,443
along. They might have a better
idea or they might have a

313
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:46,233
different approach. And I think
that one of the fun things is

314
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:51,453
like keeping an open mind about
how, how people will understand

315
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:56,284
the project and taking their
feedback and building in a

316
00:18:56,284 --> 00:19:00,723
process to have that feedback
because it's not. Just about

317
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:03,423
helping and supporting
contributors. I think it's about

318
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:06,453
learning as a maintainer too, and
that's been one of my favorite

319
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:10,183
parts. I actually think that my
favorite part of Hacktoberfest

320
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:14,314
for the last three years has been
being a maintainer and being able

321
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:20,134
to interact with others and the
all of our contributors, to learn

322
00:19:20,134 --> 00:19:23,344
from them and to hear what they
have to say about things. And

323
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:28,203
that was an experience the first
year. I know that I didn't, I

324
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:32,074
didn't realize how much I would
learn from being a maintainer.

325
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:36,099
Kirk: Yeah. Um. I think that's a
great way to phrase it. Maybe

326
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:40,750
like entice people if you're
considering like, Oh, like a lot

327
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,690
of people with the framing is
like, Oh, I don't know enough to

328
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,650
be a maintainer. Right? I'm like,
But if you have an idea and you

329
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:51,519
wanna see it to a fruition, the
best way to learn about it might

330
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,960
be to like invite other people to
help you. And you just, just get

331
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,190
that for free. Like you get, get.
And you get, people are gonna

332
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,619
teach you stuff and you get to
finish the thing you wanted to

333
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:07,720
work on. Like, it's all, it's all
upsides here. And it's weird

334
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,819
where people work on my project
like, Hey, thanks for letting me

335
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:12,279
work on this. I'm like, You just,
I didn't know how to do that.

336
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,599
That's why I made the issue, you
know, this is great. Now I do and

337
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:22,390
it's done. I wish I could do this
for every aspect of my life. Like

338
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,769
my choice and other obligations,
you know, it's like, or it just

339
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:28,869
all the times where it's like, I
don't know how to do this thing

340
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:33,009
and like doing it by myself feels
like a real struggle. And we

341
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:37,869
talk sometimes on the slack about
like, neurodiversity and just

342
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,970
like people having different mode
and the things we have to do

343
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,869
sometimes just to figure things
out. And yeah, sometimes the

344
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:48,309
answer is, Oh, I just, I just
need some help on. An open

345
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,950
source feels a lot like that. I
wanna do this thing. I need some

346
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,799
help, and then they help me.
Bekah, no one noticed that your

347
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,839
camera went on, I promise, except

348
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:58,961
Bekah: It left for a while. This
keeps happening. I did a live

349
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:03,162
stream before this and I couldn't
give my camera to work, and then

350
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:08,261
midway in the middle of a
sentence, Mike, I just totally

351
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:10,692
disconnected. It was, it was
awesome.

352
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,166
Dan: Alright.

353
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:20,785
Kirk: It started, we had this, we
were talking about like old tech

354
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:25,525
and then we, it just became like
weird UIs and then just like all

355
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:28,825
the weird quirks of technology
that we have to deal with. And

356
00:21:28,825 --> 00:21:33,144
then I'm like, Okay, cool. Now
that we've just been dunking on

357
00:21:33,144 --> 00:21:37,075
technology for the last 10
minutes, everyone here who works

358
00:21:37,075 --> 00:21:42,325
in this industry can get back to
talking about it. Sometimes,

359
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:45,384
but I guess, I don't know. It's
because we like the stuff that we

360
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:47,355
also notice the stuff and we talk
about it.

361
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:52,977
Bekah: I always, love it when
people in the wild. Make a

362
00:21:52,977 --> 00:21:55,856
comment to me about technology.
They're like, Oh, technology, You

363
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,926
know? I'm like, Oh, yeah, I know.

364
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:07,557
Dan: Yeah, no, I, I said in the,
in the chat when we were talking

365
00:22:07,856 --> 00:22:10,916
during that discussion, there's
nobody that hates computers more

366
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:15,896
than developers. like, like it
took my my wife a while to

367
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:19,047
really. And that, you know, but
now she's like, you know, she'll

368
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:22,257
have like her, her grandma ask if
I could like help her. I mean,

369
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,557
I'm fine to help her, but like,
she's like, Oh, he, he does

370
00:22:25,557 --> 00:22:27,297
computer stuff. He loves
computers. And she's like, No,

371
00:22:27,297 --> 00:22:30,537
he, he hates computers. I'm like,
I'm like, I really do.

372
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:36,896
Bekah: I had a friend ask me to
help with her printer, and I was

373
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:41,606
like, Oh, no, I don't. I don't do
printers. I, I, when my printer

374
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:44,336
doesn't work, I just buy a new
one, because that's easier than

375
00:22:44,336 --> 00:22:46,136
trying to fix existing printers.

376
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:53,217
Dan: I worked it at, college.
And you know, so the job is

377
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:55,856
mostly just like going around to
professor's offices and fixing

378
00:22:55,856 --> 00:22:58,467
their stuff and Yeah, we had a
rule like printers, you only

379
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:01,467
spend like five minutes trying to
fix whatever it is, and then you

380
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:04,767
throw it out and by and like give
them a new one. It's like

381
00:23:04,946 --> 00:23:07,436
they're, they're always just
like, printers are nightmare.

382
00:23:07,497 --> 00:23:10,227
They always have been. They still
are. They, I don't know why they

383
00:23:10,227 --> 00:23:12,326
still are, but they definitely
are.

384
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:15,912
Bekah: I don't understand. I can
buy a printer and it works like

385
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:22,721
perfectly for 30 days and then it
like hits that mark and it just

386
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:26,471
dies. It doesn't do any of the
things that it did before. I feel

387
00:23:26,477 --> 00:23:28,721
like it's making a decision to
not work.

388
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:33,000
Kirk: If you're willing to
indulge in conspiracy theories,

389
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,859
there's a perfectly valid
explanation,

390
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:37,362
Bekah: I am always here for the
conspiracy theories.

391
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,180
Kirk: But I was gonna say
this conversation, and it feels

392
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:46,704
like similar ones we've been
having for a while. Just about

393
00:23:46,704 --> 00:23:54,234
like, and we said how vast this
like tech is as a word means, I

394
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:57,085
don't even know what it means.
Like it's just, there's so much

395
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:59,845
and it, it's weird because we say
things like software developer

396
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:04,224
and like those are two words.
Yes. I don't know what those

397
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:10,075
mean. And they have very little
to do with what my job is.

398
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:13,914
And then like words like full
stack or front end or backend,

399
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:18,654
it's like that's still so
incredibly vague as to be almost

400
00:24:18,654 --> 00:24:22,164
ultimately useless. Like it
doesn't, I don't know what you do

401
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,394
when you say that at all. I could
guess and I would probably be

402
00:24:26,471 --> 00:24:29,092
Dan: Yeah, we, we actually spent
our entire hour today Virtual

403
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:32,392
Coffee, talking about that exact
thing. Mostly cuz I said in my

404
00:24:32,392 --> 00:24:36,082
intro that I don't like the word
full stack. And when I was

405
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:38,632
talking about myself, you know,
and like, I don't feel like it's

406
00:24:38,632 --> 00:24:42,862
very descriptive for what I do.
And then that started a whole, a

407
00:24:42,862 --> 00:24:44,192
whole thing but

408
00:24:44,346 --> 00:24:47,217
Bekah: instead of saying full
stack, you just say you do things

409
00:24:47,217 --> 00:24:48,116
with computers.

410
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:50,382
Dan: Yeah. At

411
00:24:50,412 --> 00:24:52,031
Bekah: much, much better.

412
00:24:52,122 --> 00:24:54,821
Dan: at yeah. Yeah, at
coffee. I ended up with, I do

413
00:24:54,821 --> 00:24:56,652
Type E. Type E. So that's

414
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,950
Kirk: Like explain it like I'm
five the subreddit. It's like

415
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,740
what a computer format, like I do
type type, and then you just see

416
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,509
what. Recently I've been saying,
I've been like very specific.

417
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,289
It's like, Oh, I write JavaScript
sometimes in type script,

418
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:19,539
sometimes in Python, sometimes
and SQL sometimes. And sometimes

419
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:23,490
I'm clicking buttons in, and
that's that's what I do right

420
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:28,640
now. That will probably change
for six months or something.

421
00:25:28,842 --> 00:25:33,192
Bekah: I was, at the hospital
with one of my kids. They had to

422
00:25:33,192 --> 00:25:38,652
get a test, and the hospital
intake person asked, she was

423
00:25:38,652 --> 00:25:43,211
like, Well, what do you do? And
in my mind what, what she really

424
00:25:43,211 --> 00:25:45,942
wanted was just like a job title
so she could put it down on the

425
00:25:45,942 --> 00:25:50,892
form. Right. And I was like, but
she said, What do you do? And so

426
00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:55,811
I was panicked because I'm like,
how do I explain what I do? I do

427
00:25:55,811 --> 00:26:00,491
things with the computer and code
and community and education and,

428
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:05,021
and I like went on this long
tangent about what I did. I was

429
00:26:05,027 --> 00:26:08,592
like, Oh, my title, it's
technical community. It was like,

430
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:13,602
really, really, I, I don't
think that she was ready for that

431
00:26:13,602 --> 00:26:15,491
at five 30 in the morning on a
Saturday.

432
00:26:18,017 --> 00:26:20,906
Dan: Yeah, it's, yeah, I can, I
can feel that whole thing

433
00:26:20,906 --> 00:26:24,326
happening every time.
Somebody asks me and or every

434
00:26:24,326 --> 00:26:27,686
time I have to do an intro
Virtual Coffee, it's like, I'm

435
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:31,287
like, Well, do I do the half hour
discussion version or do I just

436
00:26:31,287 --> 00:26:36,537
say I do computer things? Yeah.
Jesse was saying, Yeah, if

437
00:26:36,537 --> 00:26:41,156
the, if you talk to somebody in
that are in tech, then you'd be

438
00:26:41,162 --> 00:26:43,527
more, more descriptive. And if
it's somebody that doesn't know

439
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:45,356
anything, you say, I build
websites and apps, and that's,

440
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:47,186
that's mostly what I do too.
Yeah. So

441
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:49,241
Bekah: I don't do any. I don't do
that though,

442
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:52,317
Dan: Well, right now, I mean, you
know, Yeah. It's, it's a little.

443
00:26:53,051 --> 00:26:54,672
but you have a job title right?
That you

444
00:26:54,852 --> 00:26:57,882
Bekah: Yeah, that does make it
much difference. Well, she didn't

445
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:03,612
ask me my job title. She said,
What do you do? Which to me is

446
00:27:03,612 --> 00:27:06,821
like, now I have to tell a story
of the thing that I do.

447
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:11,859
Kirk: Like, who are you like as a
person? And yeah, I will write it

448
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:13,839
in this form. There's a section
for it.

449
00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:15,971
Bekah: what It felt like she
wanted my bio

450
00:27:18,162 --> 00:27:19,071
Dan: So, uh

451
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,019
Kirk: Yeah. I mean,

452
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:20,612
Dan: Go ahead, Kirk.

453
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,390
Kirk: well, Dan, like you, and
then if I think of like how Bekah

454
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,869
would describe it role, if I
think of how it, there's the

455
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:35,319
overlap, like there's overlaps,
but I don't, I make an app for

456
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:38,859
people who. Apps and websites,
you know, so like, it's a very,

457
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:46,839
it's very similar, but I don't
know, just, Oh yeah, it's, I've

458
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:49,660
been trying to like sneak the
word meta into like, all aspects

459
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,869
of my life cuz it just feels
cooler if you can like, oh, like

460
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:53,680
a meta way.

461
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:54,951
Dan: Sponsored beta.

462
00:27:55,089 --> 00:28:04,150
Kirk: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I mean, If they're tired of react

463
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,539
and they want something else
that's like super cool, just

464
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:09,730
saying, give a whole

465
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:12,461
Dan: Next time we, next time we
talk, Kirk's gonna show up with

466
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:15,311
like the NASCAR outfit and the
hat, you know, and the, like the

467
00:28:15,372 --> 00:28:18,192
jersey and stuff. Except it's all
just gonna say me over place.

468
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:27,160
Kirk: I cannot describe to you
how foreign the entire concept of

469
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:34,644
NASCAR is to every aspect of. But
it looks cool. But yeah, but

470
00:28:35,694 --> 00:28:40,000
just to say, I. Hacktoberfest
also, I feel like did that in a

471
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,279
big way of sometimes, especially
online spaces, you feel, what's

472
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,220
that word? It feels like everyone
around you sort of like doing the

473
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,859
same thing or you get that
feeling like everyone's doing the

474
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:53,349
same thing and then you start
comparing yourself to everyone

475
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:56,400
else cuz you're like, Ah,
everyone knows about like, React.

476
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,730
What I know about reactor, like
everyone knows about kit's, like

477
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,720
why? I know about kit. Like these
things. There's certain things

478
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,589
that we just talk about more and
you start like comparing yourself

479
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:08,220
to other people. Oh, everyone
knows about aws. Why aws? And

480
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:13,619
Hacktoberfest was like a real
like good reminder that there's a

481
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:19,799
lot going on here. You can only
know like 1% of 1%, like the very

482
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:24,025
thin slice. You probably like
what you have more in common of

483
00:29:24,025 --> 00:29:26,994
people is what you don't know
than what you know. So when it

484
00:29:26,994 --> 00:29:30,265
comes to open source, like you're
going to feel like a beginner in

485
00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:33,625
some things and you're going
better in other things, and like

486
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,924
that's everyone's doing that all
at the same time and you really

487
00:29:36,924 --> 00:29:41,380
shouldn't. really shouldn't like
compare yourself to others. They

488
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,490
have a whole life of experiences
that have led to like where they

489
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,599
are and what they feel good at.
And if you actually ask them,

490
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:53,079
they probably feel like you. They
probably, I also do not know what

491
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:57,430
I'm doing and I also feel like
everybody else online knows more

492
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:02,859
than me. And I also feel. You
know, I'm just, How did Julia's

493
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:05,559
daughter describe it as staring
at the screen for a couple

494
00:30:05,565 --> 00:30:08,950
minutes and hitting control, said
75 times. That is how I feel all

495
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:14,259
that time, that is my job.
But yeah, hack to profess is a

496
00:30:14,265 --> 00:30:17,440
really good reminder of that in a
way that doesn't feel like

497
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:20,109
destructive, but like feels
really healthy. You know, like

498
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,480
we're all trying to figure it.
It's like, it's like for one,

499
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:26,710
Everyone tries to figure
something out and like we all

500
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,490
accept that we're trying to
figure it out, and that's great.

501
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:35,067
Dan: Yeah, totally. And like the.
This is just, we talk about this

502
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,406
every, every time we talk about
Hacktoberfest, but like there's a

503
00:30:37,406 --> 00:30:42,957
lot of, I don't know, there's
a lot of like social things that

504
00:30:42,957 --> 00:30:46,166
go around with contrary to open
source, projects too. And

505
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:48,807
that, that, like, that is
something that causes anxiety for

506
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:52,227
me, you know? Especially,
especially when I hadn't really

507
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:55,856
done much contra, you know, open
source contributing before I

508
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:58,646
worked as a developer for a long
time before I ever, you know, did

509
00:30:58,646 --> 00:31:01,196
any open source stuff. And that's
one of the things that we try to

510
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:04,737
push here too, like with our,
with our thing is not just like,

511
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:08,277
oh, writing code or whatever, but
how to, how to like, engage in a

512
00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:10,826
community, an open source
community, whether it's a big one

513
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:14,547
or a small one. And you know, how
to, how to navigate that without

514
00:31:14,817 --> 00:31:17,396
feeling, I mean, I suppose you're
always gonna feel nervous the

515
00:31:17,396 --> 00:31:19,406
first time you do something, but
hopefully we can, you know, help

516
00:31:19,406 --> 00:31:22,886
you kind of get, go along and,
and, and do it. And so

517
00:31:22,892 --> 00:31:27,041
that's, that's one of our other.
One of, one of the other things

518
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:29,741
that we, we try to like
concentrate on is, is just,

519
00:31:30,162 --> 00:31:32,951
helping people kind of start that
journey. You know? Cause once,

520
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:36,011
once you get a couple under your
belt, it becomes like, it opens

521
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:38,622
your eyes to all the things you
can do, and everything else

522
00:31:38,622 --> 00:31:40,692
becomes a little more possible.
If, if you've done it a couple

523
00:31:40,696 --> 00:31:43,301
times, you know, maybe in a
controlled environment like

524
00:31:43,692 --> 00:31:44,281
adverse coffee.

525
00:31:45,442 --> 00:31:48,642
Bekah: Well, it's nice too that
we have maintainers who are

526
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:53,951
members because they might be
maintaining a project for fun,

527
00:31:53,957 --> 00:31:56,801
for Hacktoberfest to help people
get in, or they might be

528
00:31:56,951 --> 00:32:02,142
maintaining a larger project for
work. But I think that when you

529
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:07,332
see other people who you know in
those larger projects, let's say,

530
00:32:07,336 --> 00:32:10,332
and you have some experience
doing the things that we do at

531
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:15,402
Virtual Coffee, then it helps to
like create that path to being

532
00:32:15,406 --> 00:32:18,791
able to take on things that maybe
you would've been too scared of

533
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:22,271
before, or, you know, to go
outside of Virtual Coffee to do

534
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:25,301
the things. And I think that, you
know, decreasing those barriers

535
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:29,652
to entry, providing support and
mentorship and that community

536
00:32:29,652 --> 00:32:33,342
excitement around things goes a
long way to improving the

537
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:36,551
experience of everybody who's
involved in open source contribu.

538
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:44,833
Kirk: Yeah, it reminds me not to
get to mad enough, but, I've

539
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,623
been like re binging. I've been
binging like all the episodes of

540
00:32:47,623 --> 00:32:55,397
the podcast and I, was listening
to one with Julia. Is one, as

541
00:32:55,397 --> 00:32:59,087
I told, it's, it's the most
chaotic episode. It's just like

542
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:02,958
the first 20 minutes is so off
the rails. It's balloon Dan,

543
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:08,837
which is my, one of my favorite
Dans. You know, but you all

544
00:33:08,837 --> 00:33:11,417
were talking about like teaching
and concept of teaching what

545
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:15,678
feels good about teaching, Right?
And like the, that moment where

546
00:33:15,678 --> 00:33:22,472
you helped somebody else. Truly
gain insight. Right? Not just

547
00:33:22,472 --> 00:33:24,212
like you told them something,
they're like, Yeah, okay. But

548
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:26,522
like, you like explain something
or you show them something or you

549
00:33:26,522 --> 00:33:29,222
help them and they like, they
like say like, I get it in like

550
00:33:29,222 --> 00:33:33,002
this real moment of like pride
and joy and just like

551
00:33:33,242 --> 00:33:37,893
self-validation. That feels
really good. You know? That feels

552
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:42,468
like a. It almost like, I almost
wanna say it's like an almost

553
00:33:42,468 --> 00:33:45,738
fundamental human experience.
Like you feel it like when you're

554
00:33:45,738 --> 00:33:48,498
with your kids or with family or
like, you know, like young people

555
00:33:48,498 --> 00:33:51,317
where it's like, I helped you
figure out a thing and I can like

556
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:55,188
watch that happen. So I feel
like Hector Profess also has a

557
00:33:55,188 --> 00:33:58,038
lot of those moments where like,
you're on either side of it, but

558
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:01,488
it's like, we both did this and
now there's like a real.

559
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:05,208
Something just got like better,
you know, like, this person

560
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:08,268
learned something, like I helped
them. I love that feeling,

561
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:12,557
you know, like, I would, I'd do
that all day or I wanna do that

562
00:34:12,557 --> 00:34:18,257
all day. So that, I think
that's like my, I love, like

563
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:24,047
it's, it's a real. A lot of like
Hector Effects for me is like

564
00:34:24,077 --> 00:34:27,347
really like vicarious. Like I
can't always like jump into

565
00:34:27,347 --> 00:34:30,378
stuff, but if I'm just hanging
out the Slack it like, Hey, this

566
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:32,867
person helped this person figure
this out. They're like, Hey, I

567
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:37,518
didn't know get stuff. Someone
helped me. This is like, I could

568
00:34:37,518 --> 00:34:41,373
just, I'm just, This is like.
This is my television. I don't

569
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:44,583
know. This is like my, I can't
think of like a thing that I like

570
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,853
more than just like watching
people go, Oh, I figured this

571
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:51,242
thing out. And then like the
double up like, Oh, someone else

572
00:34:51,242 --> 00:34:56,643
helped me figure this thing out.
That feels, that feels like

573
00:34:56,643 --> 00:35:00,362
all of it really. And like
everything we do from, you know,

574
00:35:00,362 --> 00:35:05,237
the. The podcast or like the
videos or even having like the,

575
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:07,697
the one big pairing thing or
doing stuff together or like the

576
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:11,177
website, it gets all, seemed like
we're all funneling towards

577
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:16,157
making that moment like super
achievable for people. Right?

578
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:19,518
Cause like that's the thing where
you go like, Oh, actually I'm not

579
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:22,338
like worse than everybody else.
Oh, actually I think I do like

580
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:26,807
this, this work and this field
that I've chosen to do. You know,

581
00:35:26,807 --> 00:35:29,688
I do feel like I belong in this
space. Like it's those moments to

582
00:35:29,688 --> 00:35:34,652
make this. we talked about a
little bit in VC today of like,

583
00:35:35,612 --> 00:35:40,532
you know, so much, so much
for a lot of people of the

584
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:43,382
developer experience, especially
when it get, it's like just

585
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:46,322
developing alone, just like
figuring it out by yourself. It's

586
00:35:46,322 --> 00:35:50,672
just like you, you're online and
it's all by yourself, and there's

587
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:55,472
nothing like wrong with that, but
it also feels really good when

588
00:35:55,472 --> 00:35:59,237
you can do stuff with other
people. And I feel like sometimes

589
00:35:59,237 --> 00:36:02,838
that's the difference between,
yeah, I want to keep going at

590
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:06,858
this, or, Yeah, I don't, It's not
like you couldn't have done it or

591
00:36:06,858 --> 00:36:11,117
you're not capable, but. Things
are better sometimes if there's

592
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:13,577
other people to work on. Like
it's just, I'm trying to think of

593
00:36:13,577 --> 00:36:17,958
what if football, not saying
soccer can't make me, which is

594
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:24,197
like a one on one sport, same 90
minutes, same field, but just one

595
00:36:24,197 --> 00:36:27,077
person. And that's kind of how it
feels when you're working on a

596
00:36:27,077 --> 00:36:30,887
problem by yourself. Sometimes.
Just like, this is so much I

597
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:36,708
can't finish. But if like 10
other people, then it feels. The

598
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:40,927
football that is not, not soccer
for Olympics football.

599
00:36:42,818 --> 00:36:46,898
Dan: I, like that analogy. I do,
I'm getting distracted cause

600
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:50,737
like Bekah seems like she really
has something to say, or is,

601
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:54,518
maybe there's an animal loose in
her room. I'm not sure. But,

602
00:36:54,518 --> 00:36:56,797
if you're listening to this
later, Bekah is just like

603
00:36:56,802 --> 00:36:59,128
losing her mind. While Kirk
is talking,

604
00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:03,788
Bekah: It's, I'm, I'm struggling
because I'm really tired and I

605
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:07,478
didn't get a cup of coffee before
this. And like, I'm, I'm

606
00:37:07,478 --> 00:37:12,907
definitely into this conversation
and I'm just having a hard time

607
00:37:12,913 --> 00:37:17,498
with, dealing with the
physical symptoms of tiredness.

608
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:24,248
sorry. sorry. I might go get a
cup of coffee.

609
00:37:27,487 --> 00:37:28,157
Dan: Oh man.

610
00:37:29,557 --> 00:37:33,398
Bekah: well also, this is, I had
a meeting today and then I live

611
00:37:33,402 --> 00:37:37,418
streamed and this is the second
livestream. And I, I am sorry

612
00:37:37,418 --> 00:37:42,788
that I, this is the third, third
person people interaction that

613
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:46,688
I've done of the day because you
got, they had me at my best in

614
00:37:46,688 --> 00:37:54,398
the first meeting. Now I'm
whatever this two o'clock back.

615
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:58,146
Kirk: Dan, she give her the
jacket she needs

616
00:37:58,378 --> 00:38:00,967
Dan: Hmm. Pass

617
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:07,641
Kirk: You have Maybe think about
it for more than two seconds,

618
00:38:07,887 --> 00:38:09,958
Dan: Pass.

619
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:14,007
Bekah: Tom Cud has given me
permission to go get coffee, so

620
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:19,197
that's what I'm going to do so
you can talk and I will mute and

621
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:21,257
go get my coffee and then I will
be fine.

622
00:38:23,157 --> 00:38:25,213
Dan: Okay. This is. That's fine.

623
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:32,501
Kirk: Ooh, Julia Hollywood. So
Julie just mentioned Hollywood

624
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:36,356
Squares in a chat and. I feel
like I've spent the last two

625
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,266
years not seeing the parallels
between every Zoom meeting and

626
00:38:39,266 --> 00:38:42,596
Hollywood squares, and it's weird
that there hasn't been like more

627
00:38:42,596 --> 00:38:45,505
of an intersection between those
two concepts, but we can explore

628
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,436
that at another time.

629
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:55,242
Dan: Alright, well, Bekah is
gone. So, Kirk would,

630
00:38:57,326 --> 00:38:57,626
Kirk: I'm back

631
00:38:58,722 --> 00:39:00,853
Dan: no, you're, you're, you're
Kirk. Should we just talk about

632
00:39:00,858 --> 00:39:03,693
type script? type script.
Tuesday's takeover

633
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:07,240
Kirk: We're just,

634
00:39:08,052 --> 00:39:08,402
Dan: Uh,

635
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:12,581
Kirk: I mean, we can talk
about script in the, in the frame

636
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:16,061
of reference of October. Sort of
like a manifestation of

637
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:18,550
everything we've been talking
about. Right. You and I have been

638
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,240
sort of learning how to use
TypeScript together in a code

639
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,001
base, and we've been working on
it. Bekah really

640
00:39:25,108 --> 00:39:30,958
Dan: Yeah. Kinda a wild Jesse
sighting

641
00:39:35,425 --> 00:39:39,956
Kirk: This reminds me there was a
time, See, I feel like in the

642
00:39:40,016 --> 00:39:47,335
early days of Virtual Coffee eons
ago, I feel like we did not go

643
00:39:47,865 --> 00:39:55,610
one VC meeting without Bekah
being like, Ashton Kucher punked

644
00:39:55,661 --> 00:40:00,130
by at least one of her kids. And
there was a day where you locked

645
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,590
your door, you're like, I've
locked the door. They can't come

646
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,501
in. And then they opened the
window and you could just hear

647
00:40:05,505 --> 00:40:09,280
the sounds of children spilling
in through the windows.

648
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:13,527
Bekah: my, my bedroom has doors
to it, but they don't go

649
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:16,797
anywhere. They open up and
there's like a railing there, so

650
00:40:16,797 --> 00:40:21,358
you can't get through. And so
they climbed up the house. They

651
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,438
pushed like a play set and
climbed a story up, opened the

652
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:29,487
door and came into the bedroom
because I locked them out.

653
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:33,291
Kirk: It's called Manifesting
your

654
00:40:33,568 --> 00:40:38,788
Bekah: Yesterday I had a meeting
and my six year old came in to

655
00:40:38,878 --> 00:40:42,728
tell me during the meeting that
my eight year old was twerking at

656
00:40:42,728 --> 00:40:42,927
her.

657
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:55,918
Dan: Oh God, That is amazing.
that the new, Is that the new? My

658
00:40:55,918 --> 00:40:59,277
sister's staring at me. For the
modern day.

659
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:04,617
Bekah: I It must be. It must be.
Yeah. I hate when people to at me

660
00:41:04,617 --> 00:41:06,038
too. Um.

661
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:10,088
Kirk: With me is fine, but acne
is unaccept.

662
00:41:10,585 --> 00:41:13,346
Bekah: I, So I'll take you on a
tangent. I might have told this

663
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:17,905
story before, but never on a
recording. When I was in college,

664
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:21,056
I went to Prague for spring break
with like the business group, and

665
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:26,936
we went to this dance club and
this guy was tickling my armpit

666
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,135
while I was dancing. And I was
like, Is this some kinda thing

667
00:41:31,135 --> 00:41:33,985
that do in Prague? And I don't
know who was at Virtual Coffee

668
00:41:33,985 --> 00:41:36,496
when I told the story. And
they're like, This is, that is

669
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:40,315
definitely not something that,
that they do in Prague. That guy

670
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:46,556
was just really weird. Now you
all know about it too.

671
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:52,628
Kirk: I'm just, I don't know what
I thought you were gonna say, but

672
00:41:52,628 --> 00:41:55,898
that that wasn't it particularly
marked. It wasn't

673
00:41:55,956 --> 00:41:59,065
Bekah: I I don't even know how to
respond to that. I still don't

674
00:41:59,065 --> 00:42:05,036
know. And this is like many years
later. How do you respond to

675
00:42:05,036 --> 00:42:07,615
someone tickling your armpit on
the dance floor? Go ahead and

676
00:42:07,615 --> 00:42:08,755
throw that in the chat.

677
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:15,068
Kirk: that's an interest
question. Maybe when he was

678
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:17,378
six and his was eight, they

679
00:42:20,096 --> 00:42:23,606
Dan: That's a good question. Were
you twerking at him in

680
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,880
Bekah: I was most assuredly not
twerking at him.

681
00:42:31,606 --> 00:42:33,865
Dan: I mean yeah, there's
different kind. I mean, there,

682
00:42:33,925 --> 00:42:38,606
there's like twerking at somebody
where you want them to dance with

683
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,585
you and there's twerking at
somebody where you're trying to

684
00:42:40,585 --> 00:42:41,936
bother them. Right. And so

685
00:42:42,221 --> 00:42:44,900
Bekah: don't, I don't know how to
twerk. Okay.

686
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:47,755
Dan: Well, obviously you have
somebody in your house that could

687
00:42:47,755 --> 00:42:48,655
teach you, so

688
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:55,164
Kirk: it feels like you're saying
that of like, Like the, the sort

689
00:42:55,164 --> 00:42:58,733
of like father kid moment. Well,
there's different types,

690
00:42:59,126 --> 00:42:59,635
Dan: That's right.

691
00:43:01,994 --> 00:43:02,483
Kirk: ofac,

692
00:43:02,576 --> 00:43:02,936
Dan: Right?

693
00:43:03,653 --> 00:43:03,804
Kirk: there's.

694
00:43:05,545 --> 00:43:08,695
Dan: Yeah. Invitingly, right.
That's when you tickle their own

695
00:43:08,695 --> 00:43:09,175
bits.

696
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:14,635
Bekah: You should just never
tickle someone's armpits. I'm a

697
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:17,096
firm believer in not tickling
armpits,

698
00:43:21,851 --> 00:43:22,570
Dan: Uh,

699
00:43:22,795 --> 00:43:27,536
Bekah: hopefully nobody is
tickling your proverbial armpits

700
00:43:27,536 --> 00:43:29,846
on your Hacktoberfest repository.

701
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,141
Dan: there she is. The master of.

702
00:43:37,344 --> 00:43:40,373
Kirk: But also like your real,
like not, it doesn't, you know,

703
00:43:40,373 --> 00:43:44,543
metaphorically or not? Probably,
probably. No, I don't think you

704
00:43:44,543 --> 00:43:51,668
need to like put it in a code
conduct, but. Maybe after that

705
00:43:51,668 --> 00:43:55,268
guy went to that, that dance
place in Prague, they put it on

706
00:43:55,268 --> 00:43:59,018
their code of. con on the door.
Like, you know, no like must wear

707
00:43:59,023 --> 00:44:06,298
shirt, no armpit, tickling, you
know, Don't, Proverbial is an

708
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:11,469
excellent band name. Tom. You are
right. I, think when we

709
00:44:11,469 --> 00:44:16,628
decided to do this, this one
live. Thoroughly did not

710
00:44:16,628 --> 00:44:20,108
anticipate the fact that we would
have to talk while reading chat,

711
00:44:20,528 --> 00:44:23,889
and as everyone here knows, that
is very difficult for us.

712
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,121
Dan: I, I mean, yeah, I, I,
you know, there's been a couple

713
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:35,411
comments in the, in the chat
about Yes, you shouldn't just,

714
00:44:35,561 --> 00:44:39,221
just in general life rule, don't
take a strangers aren't bits, you

715
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:44,576
know, you want them. Any armpit,
tickling to be consensual. All

716
00:44:44,576 --> 00:44:46,255
right, hold on. There's a
delivery person walking in right

717
00:44:46,255 --> 00:44:46,496
now,

718
00:44:51,068 --> 00:44:51,659
Kirk: That's perfect.

719
00:44:51,835 --> 00:44:55,436
Dan: That was really well timed.
cool, well, got my package

720
00:44:55,436 --> 00:44:58,916
delivered. Well, hopefully he
walked out with the knowledge,

721
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:02,005
you know, the wisdom to not
tickle the people's armpits that,

722
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:04,496
haven't given prior consent.

723
00:45:05,186 --> 00:45:10,856
Bekah: Can we need, Listen, we
need a sticker in the Virtual

724
00:45:10,856 --> 00:45:14,246
Coffee store, that that talks
about that.

725
00:45:17,155 --> 00:45:19,976
Dan: If somebody makes that
sticker, I will put it on the

726
00:45:19,976 --> 00:45:23,545
store. I promise.

727
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:26,005
Bekah: need a structured YOLO
sticker. We're about to run a

728
00:45:26,005 --> 00:45:30,326
contest or something to get those
in there. Ooh. Make an issue for

729
00:45:30,326 --> 00:45:35,425
arm tickling. I really enjoy
derailing the conversation.

730
00:45:37,826 --> 00:45:41,425
Dan: Yes. No, Kirk, Kirk
said, yes. Imagining the

731
00:45:41,425 --> 00:45:43,496
delivery person walking in,
seeing my jacket and talking

732
00:45:43,496 --> 00:45:47,815
about arm tickling, in a
stream. Yeah, no, I imagine

733
00:45:47,815 --> 00:45:51,565
that that gentleman will be
sharing that story when he gets

734
00:45:51,565 --> 00:45:53,155
back from a shift.

735
00:45:55,193 --> 00:45:58,284
Kirk: I'm gonna say, so I mean,
you're probably like, you don't

736
00:45:58,284 --> 00:46:02,543
even place on like the weirdest
events that have happened while

737
00:46:02,543 --> 00:46:05,123
he's delivering things. Right?
Like so, you know, I always like

738
00:46:05,123 --> 00:46:07,853
to remind myself of that
sometimes whenever I'm like, Oh,

739
00:46:07,853 --> 00:46:13,403
was that. Weird or awkward. I'm
like, it doesn't even rank on the

740
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:16,403
things happening in the world.
Bekah got armpit-tickled in real

741
00:46:16,403 --> 00:46:17,184
life in.

742
00:46:19,706 --> 00:46:20,876
Bekah: Real armpit tickled.

743
00:46:24,063 --> 00:46:24,414
Dan: uh,

744
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:29,724
Bekah: I used my segue and then
nobody followed up.

745
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:33,516
Kirk: It, it didn't take, you
know, like some, when you have

746
00:46:33,516 --> 00:46:35,436
like a lighter and you do the
first flick and like, it just

747
00:46:35,436 --> 00:46:37,177
does like the,

748
00:46:37,289 --> 00:46:40,344
Bekah: hard to have two armpit
tickling segues though.

749
00:46:42,907 --> 00:46:44,016
Kirk: anyone can do it. It's,

750
00:46:45,088 --> 00:46:45,759
Dan: I have faith

751
00:46:47,963 --> 00:46:50,543
Bekah: speaking of armpit
tickling, what have been your

752
00:46:50,543 --> 00:46:55,293
uncomfortable moments in your
Hacktoberfest history.

753
00:46:57,817 --> 00:46:58,206
Kirk: Oh.

754
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:00,849
Dan: you know, actually that's a,
that's, Hey, Bekah, that's a

755
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:05,228
really good question and, a
wonderful segue. Thank you.

756
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,688
This is actually something I was
gonna talk about, before you

757
00:47:07,693 --> 00:47:11,318
left to get a cup of coffee in
the middle of our stream,

758
00:47:11,768 --> 00:47:19,449
was, was, Okay. Well, that's
fair. Is, you said

759
00:47:19,509 --> 00:47:22,778
uncomfortable moments, eh, And
there, there are some like, so.

760
00:47:23,528 --> 00:47:27,039
We were talking about, the
positive sides of, you know,

761
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:29,559
becoming a maintainer and, and,
and open sourcing your project

762
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:32,079
and doing that things. And just
from a, from a maintainer

763
00:47:32,469 --> 00:47:36,159
standpoint, there are like, you
know, it, it can be hard too, you

764
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:41,259
know, it can be, like
difficult to navigate sometimes.

765
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:44,409
And again, here's like, the
social issues are more of problem

766
00:47:44,409 --> 00:47:47,438
than like the technology or code
parts of it. You know what I

767
00:47:47,438 --> 00:47:52,989
mean? Is how to, navigate
some of that stuff. And, and

768
00:47:52,989 --> 00:47:57,639
like, as a person who is not
always the best, I don't know,

769
00:47:57,699 --> 00:48:03,309
like I I, I, I don't know
my reactions to things are, you

770
00:48:03,309 --> 00:48:05,648
know, you know, usually sometimes
like my erections come out, like,

771
00:48:05,648 --> 00:48:07,599
you know, you have a gut reaction
to something and then you like

772
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,878
realize that, oh, okay, let's,
you know, think about this for a

773
00:48:09,878 --> 00:48:11,918
little bit. And, you know, it
took me a while to figure out

774
00:48:11,918 --> 00:48:17,978
that I needed to pause before I,
you know, before I let any gut

775
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,018
reactions like come through or
whatever and think through some

776
00:48:20,018 --> 00:48:22,974
things and, you know, help
communicate with that. But

777
00:48:22,974 --> 00:48:26,153
it's like, I think the biggest
part of that is, is

778
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,583
communication. All right. I'm
sorry, I glanced at the chat in

779
00:48:28,733 --> 00:48:33,384
us. Just like Bekah, you are the
one that was trying to segue us

780
00:48:33,384 --> 00:48:36,384
back over here and, I feel
like, you know, you're not,

781
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:36,653
you're not

782
00:48:36,858 --> 00:48:38,469
Bekah: I didn't say anything. It
was

783
00:48:38,664 --> 00:48:44,364
Dan: yes, you were giggling and
chatting and you know,

784
00:48:44,844 --> 00:48:47,784
it's just sometimes hard to, hard
to concentrate. But, you

785
00:48:47,789 --> 00:48:49,824
know, I don't really have any
idea what I was saying.

786
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:54,338
Bekah: Responding to people
in communication and taking a

787
00:48:54,338 --> 00:48:59,329
step back before going with your
gut feeling, See?

788
00:49:00,744 --> 00:49:04,673
Dan: yes, exactly. So anyway,
communication skills important,

789
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:08,543
but it is a very good place
to practice those and get better.

790
00:49:08,543 --> 00:49:12,204
I've be, I have become a much
better, I mean, certainly a much

791
00:49:12,204 --> 00:49:17,094
better open source maintainer,
since the first time I did it

792
00:49:17,094 --> 00:49:22,583
was when we started this thing
three years ago. And. You

793
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:25,494
know, over the last three years
have have like learned a ton, you

794
00:49:25,494 --> 00:49:29,994
know, and I'm, I feel much better
about doing it now than I looking

795
00:49:29,994 --> 00:49:31,853
back, than I did. You know, I
felt confident about it going

796
00:49:31,853 --> 00:49:34,463
into it in the first place. But
that's where you, you just like,

797
00:49:35,153 --> 00:49:37,974
it's just one of those things
where the only way to really get

798
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:42,534
good at it is to do it. And
that's why, that, that's just why

799
00:49:42,534 --> 00:49:44,903
I'm, I'm always like behind Kirk,
like what Kirk was saying was,

800
00:49:44,934 --> 00:49:47,844
you know, it's a great time to,
like, this is a great time to do

801
00:49:47,844 --> 00:49:50,844
it because we have, like, all of
our resources are pointing

802
00:49:50,844 --> 00:49:53,213
towards that. I mean, not our,
like researchers on our site, but

803
00:49:53,213 --> 00:49:56,664
all of Virtual Coffee right now
is doing Hacktoberfest stuff, you

804
00:49:56,668 --> 00:50:00,054
know what I mean? And we have a
ton of, support for

805
00:50:00,353 --> 00:50:04,764
maintainers and stuff as well.
And those, those that's,

806
00:50:04,824 --> 00:50:07,193
that support exists all, all year
round. You know, if you're

807
00:50:07,193 --> 00:50:08,994
thinking about open source
project, doesn't have to be right

808
00:50:08,998 --> 00:50:12,384
now, obviously. But it's a
good time to do it and you'll

809
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:17,498
have. Probably have instantly
have people that wanna contribute

810
00:50:17,498 --> 00:50:21,188
if you have a project that's open
source during heta profess.

811
00:50:21,878 --> 00:50:25,059
so I dunno, that's, that's my
little bit is, you

812
00:50:25,074 --> 00:50:26,483
Bekah: My goal this year is to

813
00:50:26,563 --> 00:50:27,099
Dan: in and do it.

814
00:50:27,534 --> 00:50:31,134
Bekah: the momentum beyond
Hacktoberfest, right? Like, to

815
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:36,054
continue to do open source
projects and to work with other

816
00:50:36,054 --> 00:50:41,364
people at Virtual Coffee or, you
know, outside of our community

817
00:50:41,364 --> 00:50:46,494
and keep moving these things that
I'm really excited about forward.

818
00:50:46,914 --> 00:50:49,494
And I think that, you know,
hopefully we can build some of

819
00:50:49,494 --> 00:50:52,884
that accountab some of that
accountability into Virtual

820
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:56,724
Coffee for other maintainers who
want that support and

821
00:50:56,963 --> 00:51:02,304
contributors beyond Virtual
Coffees, VCHI Virtual Coffee

822
00:51:02,304 --> 00:51:06,114
Hacktoberfest Initiative.
and, and just keep going with it

823
00:51:06,114 --> 00:51:10,313
because I think it is a really
great way to learn more about how

824
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:13,704
to contribute, how to be a
maintain. To work on that

825
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:16,373
communication because
communication can be really hard.

826
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:19,373
And so, you know, this is, this
is the start of it, and we're

827
00:51:19,373 --> 00:51:20,063
gonna keep going.

828
00:51:20,873 --> 00:51:24,833
Kirk: We call VCHI VCHI also
because it's. It's a reference to

829
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:28,224
the word chai as like another
coffee tie.

830
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:29,231
Bekah: Yep.

831
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:29,905
Dan: I don't.

832
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:32,460
Bekah: Mm-hmm. That's exactly
what were thinking.

833
00:51:34,253 --> 00:51:37,494
Kirk: Great. That's a great idea.
We were super smart for thinking

834
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:43,134
about that. But also yes, to
everything that, that you said,

835
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:49,224
like sustain. I don't know. I, I
think I spend a lot of time

836
00:51:49,224 --> 00:51:54,099
thinking about like
sustainability. In many ways

837
00:51:56,768 --> 00:52:00,998
I feel like a lot of the things
in my life, like I can get this

838
00:52:00,998 --> 00:52:08,048
like big burst of energy and do a
flurry of activity and then, but

839
00:52:08,048 --> 00:52:10,929
then all that energy like goes
away and then I'm like, Oh no,

840
00:52:10,929 --> 00:52:13,688
what do I do now? That thing I
used to do, all this stuff is

841
00:52:13,688 --> 00:52:19,463
gone. And you know, like that
sort of. A lot of the stuff we've

842
00:52:19,463 --> 00:52:21,443
been talking about in this
community just in general and

843
00:52:21,443 --> 00:52:26,454
reading like about like having to
not rely on like inspiration

844
00:52:26,454 --> 00:52:31,554
slash motivation and how to like
turn things into processes and

845
00:52:31,554 --> 00:52:34,733
routines that either like provide
you what you need to make things

846
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:40,284
sustained or like just lowering
the barrier on yourself for what

847
00:52:40,284 --> 00:52:42,623
you have to put into things to
get like the outcomes that you

848
00:52:42,713 --> 00:52:46,838
want. So Yeah, I feel like that's
a really. I don't know. That

849
00:52:46,838 --> 00:52:49,989
feels like a really good goal and
I should probably do the same

850
00:52:49,989 --> 00:52:57,818
thing. Yeah. And you know, if
we also, if Segway wants to

851
00:52:57,818 --> 00:52:59,438
sponsor, I don't, do they still
make those

852
00:52:59,606 --> 00:53:03,266
Bekah: Yeah, I saw people like
riding around them in a segue

853
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:04,525
pack in Pittsburgh.

854
00:53:09,818 --> 00:53:10,389
Kirk: collective.

855
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:12,161
Bekah: flock,

856
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:16,989
Kirk: A herd

857
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:17,960
Bekah: of.

858
00:53:20,588 --> 00:53:25,568
Kirk: It's like when Dan was in
that, that group of his, when

859
00:53:25,568 --> 00:53:33,278
he was a kid, The kids of. Bad
town, I know that's their name,

860
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,190
Dan: Yeah, that's it. What did
you say it was?

861
00:53:40,643 --> 00:53:43,014
Kirk: I've been, Every time I
mention, I think this is like the

862
00:53:43,014 --> 00:53:47,423
fifth time, and every time I try
and say a new name, it's like

863
00:53:47,574 --> 00:53:51,083
Benedict, like you can't say his
real name. You have to say like

864
00:53:51,143 --> 00:53:53,753
Bumblebee pumpkin patch. Like
you, there's no, Why would you,

865
00:53:54,833 --> 00:54:02,423
you know, like the whole point.
Anyway, it's fine. Dan was? in a

866
00:54:02,423 --> 00:54:02,844
scooter

867
00:54:03,036 --> 00:54:05,755
Dan: It was not a scooter gang at
that point. I'm going to, I'm not

868
00:54:05,755 --> 00:54:08,815
gonna, Yes. End that. I've, I
don't ride scooters. I am not

869
00:54:08,815 --> 00:54:12,865
interested in that. It's a
mountain bike gang called the

870
00:54:13,195 --> 00:54:18,626
Sugar Hill Pumpkin patch Crew. I
dunno, trying to remember what

871
00:54:18,626 --> 00:54:24,746
you said. But we were
awesome. So, you know, what are

872
00:54:24,746 --> 00:54:29,485
you gonna do? Yes. Rebecca says
mountain bike for the win. Yes.

873
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:35,851
Kirk: No, maybe Bekah was right
about getting more coffee. I saw

874
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:42,242
MTV and I was like, Major
trifecta baseball. I could not

875
00:54:42,422 --> 00:54:47,851
put that together. Okay, now
the chat's, just talking about

876
00:54:48,331 --> 00:54:49,601
bikes, and Jesse

877
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,838
Dan: Jesse, how dare you.

878
00:54:50,882 --> 00:54:51,601
Kirk: so just low

879
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:57,349
Dan: Jesse says, Bikes are just
low tech scooters. Right? And I

880
00:54:57,378 --> 00:54:58,668
did that say, how dare you, sir.

881
00:55:01,427 --> 00:55:06,436
Kirk: I are just overly
engineered, unicycles, you know,

882
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:06,916
like

883
00:55:08,673 --> 00:55:12,273
Bekah: Yeah. It's interesting how
bikes are so much like open

884
00:55:12,273 --> 00:55:17,733
source contributions, right? Like
you gotta learn how to get on the

885
00:55:17,733 --> 00:55:23,103
bike, learn how to ride the bike,
and how to maintain momentum. And

886
00:55:23,103 --> 00:55:26,884
that's what we're trying to do
here. come on. It wasn't too bad.

887
00:55:27,409 --> 00:55:30,858
Dan: I wish I had, I wish I had
my soundboard here. Yes, I

888
00:55:30,858 --> 00:55:32,809
would've air horned that one.
That one was awesome.

889
00:55:36,226 --> 00:55:41,237
Kirk: Just Bekah segues. We would
like a very specific sound.

890
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:43,548
Dan: just like a

891
00:55:43,577 --> 00:55:43,907
Kirk: I wonder.

892
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:45,228
Dan: sound or something, you
know?

893
00:55:47,974 --> 00:55:48,333
Bekah: I'm here

894
00:55:48,436 --> 00:55:51,947
Kirk: Is it. possible to do like
an entire presentation of like

895
00:55:52,637 --> 00:55:56,686
only segue, I guess you can't be
only segue, right? Because like a

896
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,746
segue is like a conjunction. So
like you, you need things

897
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:03,139
Dan: But you could write an
awesome segue between each slide

898
00:56:03,139 --> 00:56:04,909
or something if you're doing a
talk, if that's what we're

899
00:56:04,909 --> 00:56:05,719
talking about, you know,

900
00:56:05,884 --> 00:56:10,594
Bekah: I think you, I, I would
argue that you only need to start

901
00:56:10,594 --> 00:56:16,173
with one thing and then the
entire rest of the presentation

902
00:56:16,173 --> 00:56:17,974
could be rolling. Segues

903
00:56:20,302 --> 00:56:24,661
Kirk: Right, because a segue can
segue from one segue to another

904
00:56:24,918 --> 00:56:26,179
Dan: of rolling segues,

905
00:56:29,702 --> 00:56:30,061
Kirk: functional

906
00:56:30,259 --> 00:56:39,469
Dan: functional programming.
yeah, I segues. Make me think of

907
00:56:39,474 --> 00:56:43,699
the, white and nerdy weird L
music video, which is amazing if

908
00:56:43,813 --> 00:56:47,554
Bekah: my eight year old listens
to that like every single day.

909
00:56:48,634 --> 00:56:49,083
Julia,

910
00:56:49,351 --> 00:56:50,311
Kirk: That's where you tour.

911
00:56:50,643 --> 00:56:53,434
Bekah: great. Julia's got some
really good extensions here. It's

912
00:56:53,434 --> 00:56:56,583
easy to buy a bike, but you need
someone to help you learn how to

913
00:56:56,583 --> 00:57:01,384
maintain it. Absolutely right.
It's easier to keep up the

914
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:04,653
routine maintenance and get the
most out of your bike investment

915
00:57:04,804 --> 00:57:08,733
if you have other cyclists around
to mentor you and ride with you.

916
00:57:08,974 --> 00:57:13,324
This is great. There's an entire
blog post right here in the chat.

917
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:15,393
Somebody just needs to put it
together.

918
00:57:17,206 --> 00:57:20,266
Kirk: And then you can tie in
that phrase to tech people say

919
00:57:20,266 --> 00:57:23,686
sometimes like shedding and it
all.

920
00:57:24,543 --> 00:57:26,914
Dan: We're bike shedding, we're
bike shedding the sway.

921
00:57:26,956 --> 00:57:27,347
Kirk: Yeah,

922
00:57:28,083 --> 00:57:28,503
Bekah: I don't know what

923
00:57:28,503 --> 00:57:31,954
Dan: just like, dog fooding
and,

924
00:57:32,206 --> 00:57:34,157
Kirk: See, I specifically didn't
say that

925
00:57:34,293 --> 00:57:40,853
Dan: Shotgun foot, foot
gunning, cat treating. And,

926
00:57:45,137 --> 00:57:48,436
Kirk: No, no. But my is the real
thing. It's a real phrase that

927
00:57:48,527 --> 00:57:52,577
people actually say. It is far
more tolerable than, than

928
00:57:52,684 --> 00:57:55,773
Dan: curious to know why it's
bike shed and not like some other

929
00:57:55,773 --> 00:57:58,474
kind of shed. So bike shedding,
for those of you who don't know,

930
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:00,994
is in computer. When, when you're
talking about it with

931
00:58:00,994 --> 00:58:04,023
development, it's like spending
all of your time and resources on

932
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:06,963
this thing that's sitting on the
side instead of your house,

933
00:58:06,969 --> 00:58:09,333
right? Like, so, like in the
metaphor, your house is like the

934
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:12,364
actual app or whatever you're
working on, and the bike shed is

935
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:15,393
just this like little thing on
the side and you're, you know,

936
00:58:15,634 --> 00:58:17,853
you're making your bike shed
really fancy, but not working on

937
00:58:17,853 --> 00:58:21,483
your house. Like that's the,
that's the, I don't use the term,

938
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:26,719
but that's what the term means.
But like, why bike shed and

939
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:34,429
not, you know, but like, is a
bike shed a thing? Do people

940
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:38,148
have, I suppose they probably do
somewhere. I dunno, But like,

941
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:44,628
yeah, I'm just saying of all the
things to choose for that

942
00:58:44,628 --> 00:58:46,759
metaphor, why a bike shed is my
question.

943
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:49,009
Bekah: Because

944
00:58:49,099 --> 00:58:50,148
Dan: Speaking of bike, shes,

945
00:58:50,248 --> 00:58:51,329
Bekah: a bike gang

946
00:58:53,929 --> 00:58:57,528
Dan: Oh yeah. Yak, shaving. I
don't remember what that one

947
00:58:57,528 --> 00:58:57,889
means.

948
00:58:58,128 --> 00:59:00,228
Bekah: use that out loud. That's,
This

949
00:59:00,289 --> 00:59:03,228
Dan: Oh, is, is that, am I,
am I getting code of conducted

950
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:05,858
All, All,

951
00:59:05,902 --> 00:59:10,967
Kirk: I. My next high tour first
project will be a bot that just

952
00:59:10,967 --> 00:59:16,126
takes like random MO and then one
of these things and just puts it

953
00:59:16,126 --> 00:59:19,606
together and then just makes up
some sort of nonsense

954
00:59:19,606 --> 00:59:22,456
definitions. It's like these are
All the tech terms. I put them

955
00:59:22,456 --> 00:59:23,777
all in this bot, you know?

956
00:59:24,184 --> 00:59:24,664
Dan: I love that

957
00:59:25,067 --> 00:59:26,956
Kirk: What was that one you said
earlier? Cat feeding.

958
00:59:28,204 --> 00:59:29,594
Dan: cat treating. I think she
said

959
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:31,039
Bekah: Yes, that's what I said.

960
00:59:34,077 --> 00:59:39,677
Kirk: We, that'll be my next
project. I feel like we can,

961
00:59:39,856 --> 00:59:44,177
slowly but surely, I feel like we
have managed to talk a little bit

962
00:59:44,237 --> 00:59:49,097
about OSS and open source. And I
feel like for those of you

963
00:59:49,097 --> 00:59:52,577
listening and watching, if you
take anything away from this, it

964
00:59:52,577 --> 00:59:58,637
is that, we really enjoy this
time. And in many ways

965
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:03,692
Hacktoberfest is the thing that
like. Really solidified a lot of

966
01:00:03,692 --> 01:00:09,601
parts of Virtual Coffee. It was
how the maintainers sort of like

967
01:00:09,601 --> 01:00:15,362
became the maintainers. It
was how we like normalized a ton

968
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:17,762
of things. It was how we like set
the direction for a ton of

969
01:00:17,762 --> 01:00:22,996
things. It was how I think a lot
of us made the decision to. This

970
01:00:22,996 --> 01:00:26,597
wasn't like, this was like, Oh,
this is VC is like a thing that

971
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:30,016
we wanna keep doing and like, it,
it exists as like a space that

972
01:00:30,016 --> 01:00:32,927
can do a lot of good, you know,
in addition to like the personal

973
01:00:32,931 --> 01:00:36,586
good was doing for us, but just
like, just like a really good

974
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:41,686
thing to be like kept and
maintained. So we, we care about

975
01:00:41,686 --> 01:00:45,047
it a lot and we're really excited
that it's still happening. We're

976
01:00:45,047 --> 01:00:47,536
still sort of feeling the way we
felt about it at the beginning,

977
01:00:48,137 --> 01:00:52,097
because at the end of the
day, Hacktoberfest really isn't

978
01:00:52,097 --> 01:00:54,617
about the like individual
projects we're working on. It's

979
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:58,367
about the collaboration with
other people. And the reason I

980
01:00:58,367 --> 01:01:02,146
managed to get through of that is
explicitly did not read whatever

981
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:02,956
posted.

982
01:01:06,884 --> 01:01:08,673
Dan: I'm proud of you. It's
impressive.

983
01:01:09,108 --> 01:01:12,858
Bekah: You did an excellent job,
Kirk. You did a much better job

984
01:01:12,858 --> 01:01:17,989
than Dan and I normally do on the
podcast wrapping things up. So I

985
01:01:17,994 --> 01:01:22,818
think it's probably a good time
to wrap up and think about what

986
01:01:22,818 --> 01:01:23,358
Kirk said.

987
01:01:24,634 --> 01:01:27,693
Dan: I always think about what
Kirk said. I spend most of my

988
01:01:27,842 --> 01:01:28,561
Kirk: I never think about

989
01:01:28,594 --> 01:01:32,434
Dan: about what Kirk says.
Yes, I know. I mean, I just also

990
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:36,889
like to add, I mean, thank you to
everybody that, it's here

991
01:01:36,889 --> 01:01:39,619
today, and thank you to everybody
who's been contributing to

992
01:01:39,619 --> 01:01:42,259
Hacktoberfest and listen to our
podcast and hanging out in

993
01:01:42,259 --> 01:01:46,159
Virtual Coffee. Like Kirk
said, this is like, I mean, this

994
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:48,768
is my favorite time of the year,
for, for Virtual Coffee

995
01:01:48,768 --> 01:01:51,708
stuff. The Hacktoberfest stuff is
really exciting for me. I love

996
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,918
open source stuff in general. I'm
gonna say stuff a few more times

997
01:01:54,918 --> 01:01:58,878
in this sentence, and then
I'll wrap it up. But I don't

998
01:01:58,878 --> 01:02:01,938
know, it's, it's just a good time
and, yeah, has, has a special

999
01:02:01,938 --> 01:02:04,989
place in my heart too, because
the reasons Kirk said,

1000
01:02:05,148 --> 01:02:07,668
sort of the genesis of a lot of
the things that are actually

1001
01:02:07,668 --> 01:02:11,119
happening in Virtual Coffee now.
And it's,

1002
01:02:11,188 --> 01:02:11,588
Bekah: the podcast.

1003
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,289
Dan: a good, including the
podcast and the website itself

1004
01:02:15,289 --> 01:02:18,259
didn't exist. We, I made it so
that we could have that issue,

1005
01:02:18,829 --> 01:02:23,449
to have people add themselves
as members. And so, like a

1006
01:02:23,454 --> 01:02:26,148
lot of stuff, a lot of stuff came
out from, from, from

1007
01:02:26,148 --> 01:02:29,119
Hacktoberfest. V1. V1. So

1008
01:02:30,259 --> 01:02:33,539
Bekah: we are grateful for
everyone here and for this

1009
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:34,668
Hacktoberfest season.

1010
01:02:37,579 --> 01:02:42,018
Dan: Alright, well then I think
with that we'll wrap up.

1011
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,289
Thank you again everybody for
coming. Follow us on, you

1012
01:02:45,289 --> 01:02:48,559

1015
01:02:59,059 --> 01:03:01,219
I am, I am at the end of my
sentence and I don't know how to

1016
01:03:01,219 --> 01:03:03,768
wrap up. So somebody finish this
thing and then I'll hit end

1017
01:03:05,003 --> 01:03:06,514
Bekah: Thanks for being here,
friends.

1018
01:03:08,657 --> 01:03:09,077
