00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:07,500
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello and
welcome to Season 6, Episode 9

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:07,972
of the

2
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:11,723
Virtual Coffee Podcast. We are
live because this is our season

3
00:00:11,723 --> 00:00:15,700
finale and we are very excited
to be here with you. Virtual

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,463
Coffee

4
00:00:16,463 --> 00:00:20,062
is a group of developers at all
stages of their coding journey,

5
00:00:20,242 --> 00:00:22,000
and they're here on this
podcast, sharing their stories

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,402
and what

6
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:25,103
they've learned. But really it's
the last episode of the season.

7
00:00:25,103 --> 00:00:29,062
And so, it is the three of us
sharing our stories and what

8
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:35,362
we've learned. So, we'll do
an intro question in a second.

9
00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:40,552
But do you want to -- does
anybody wanna give us an intro

10
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:45,063
question? Hey, Debra-Kaye!

11
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:49,800
Kirk Shillingford: Do you want
to use the one from VC -- oh,

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,000
that might be a spoiler for when
this was done, but like, today-

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,300
Bekah: Yes.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,192
Kirk: -is -- oh, I didn't hear

13
00:00:55,313 --> 00:00:57,442
Dan cuz he wasn't in my room
and I don't think he could make

14
00:00:57,442 --> 00:01:01,500
it today, Bekah. So the question
is, do you like sour? And if you

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,700
do, what is your favorite sour
food? And Bekah is already

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,813
making faces. So --

17
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:10,000
Bekah: [Chuckles] My name's
Bekah. I'm a technical community

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,808
builder from a small

18
00:01:10,808 --> 00:01:15,608
town in Ohio. And sour is the
worst. Like, I am pretty open

19
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:19,700
about different tastes, but I
draw the line at sour. They --

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,000
it -- if I drink like any kind
of sour beer, I immediately have

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,647
heartburn. And sour

21
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:30,668
just makes your face go like ...
and that means it's bad. So,

22
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:34,028
hard pass on sour. I will take
bitter all day long.

23
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:42,082
Dan: Alright. Hi, I am Dan. I
do computer things in Cleveland

24
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:49,222
and, yes. I don't judge foods
based on facial expressions, you

25
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:54,533
know, in general. I- I- I
like- I like some sour things,

26
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:56,992
you know? I- I definitely like a
little bit of sour in a lot of

27
00:01:56,998 --> 00:01:59,300
things, you know? I -- like, we
had tacos the other night,

28
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,700
squeeze the lime up -- lime on
top of the chicken. Really,

29
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,722
really good. It doesn't

29
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,703
make, like, the whole taco taste
sour, you know what I mean? But

30
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,700
it's just like that little dash
of --

31
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:08,758
Bekah: Well, I like citrus. That
doesn't really count as sour.

32
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:11,300
Dan: I -- okay. I mean, like,
it's- it's just like a little

33
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:11,902
touch of it,

33
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:14,002
you know what I mean? That's-
that's what I mean. But I don't

34
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:17,423
like, like, I- I- I was saying
this in- in the room, I, you

35
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:20,152
know, I'll eat like a- like a
sour patch kids, you know, for

36
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:22,500
instance. Which is like, sort of
sour. It's mostly-

37
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,000
Bekah: [Chuckles] Worst.

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,000
Dan: -sugar anyway. But like,
definitely my last choice of-

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
of -- from the Halloween bucket
that my kids always have full

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,693
of candy somehow all

39
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:35,872
year round [laughs]. So, yeah.
That's- that's my answer. I'm

40
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:39,772
ambivalent. Citrus, I'm a
huge fan of. And I think sour is

41
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:42,000
part of the citrus thing, you
know? So --

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Bekah: I refuse to say that.

42
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,133
Dan: I can't just say I don't
like sour.

43
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:44,487
Bekah: Because I love citrus.

44
00:02:46,538 --> 00:02:50,687
Dan: [Chuckles] Fair enough.
Waddup, Kirk?

45
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:52,700
Kirk: I have- I have a lot --
you've been saying so -- okay.

46
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,388
So, first

46
00:02:53,388 --> 00:02:55,638
of all- first of all, my name
Kirk. Let's just get outta the

47
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:58,997
way. That's not -- that's
irrelevant at the moment. In

48
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:02,500
our room, immediately, we get
the discussion of does citrus

49
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,693
count? And I said, yes. Because
I'm gonna say this thing that I

50
00:03:08,842 --> 00:03:11,700
hate. I don't wanna yuck
anyone's yum. Which now also

51
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,622
feels like a sour referen-

52
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:15,247
Dan: Didn't- didn't we make a
rule that you weren't allowed to

53
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:15,997
say that anymore? [Bekah laughs]

54
00:03:17,473 --> 00:03:21,443
Kirk: That was so long ago, you
know? But [unintelligible] --

55
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:22,700
Dan: [Laughs] It has to be one
of the worst phrases in the

56
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,437
entire world.

56
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:28,612
Kirk: But also, like, everything
you said about why you don't

57
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:31,700
like cit- like, I- I want sour
things like once a year. And

58
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,000
when I eat, I do make the faces
of like a baby when they're

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
given -- like, I- I do all of --
I can't help it. And then

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,527
everyone around me just laughs
at

60
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:42,247
my face. Like, I just fully lean
into that, you know? It's like

61
00:03:42,252 --> 00:03:44,700
those old lemon drop candies.
Like, I just -- I do it and

62
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,700
then, you know, like my soul
just like shutters and then it's

63
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,500
great. But it's like pepper,
right? Like, we're not supposed

64
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:51,907
to eat ...

64
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:56,000
pepper, right? Like, pepper
just want -- like, birds- birds

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,893
can't -- birds

65
00:03:57,893 --> 00:04:01,823
don't care about capsaicin. So
plants made spicy so that

66
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:04,000
mammals wouldn't eat the food.
Birds lead the food cuz birds

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,002
travel farther and

67
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:09,348
distribute the seeds farther,
like, when they poop. But, like,

68
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:11,500
humans or mammals, but we're
just like, "Hey, this, like,

69
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,228
hurts.

69
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:14,300
But I'm kind of into it." And
that's why like we have [laughs]

70
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,367
-- so, in a word, we're doing
stuff that

70
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:18,827
we're not supposed to be doing.
I mean, like, sours supposed

71
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:22,608
to be like, this is probably not
meant to be consumed, as is

72
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:25,877
bitter. But here we are. So just
lean into it. It's bad because

73
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:31,367
it's good. It's bad cuz it's
good. Put it on a t-shirt.

74
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:31,937
[Bekah chuckles] That's my
intro.

75
00:04:33,778 --> 00:04:39,338
Bekah: I've never heard anyone
say it that way. And also, I

76
00:04:39,338 --> 00:04:42,000
will do what I want with this
stream because I have the power.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,500
So ... if you're listening-

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,700
Dan: [Chuckles] Yeah.

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,038
Bekah: -I discovered that I can
change the way things look, and

78
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,317
this is going to be fun.

79
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:51,502
Kirk: This is what?

80
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:53,507
Dan: Mm. That's great.

81
00:04:54,247 --> 00:04:59,108
Bekah: So welcome everybody to
this live podcast. Thanks for

82
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:02,557
all those who are joining us
live. If you have a question or

83
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:06,000
if you have a topic that you
want to hear us talk about, go

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,427
ahead

84
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:10,237
and put that in the chat and
we'll do an excellent job of

85
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:12,127
keeping up with it at all times.

86
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,708
Dan: We promise.

87
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:20,947
Bekah: Alright. Why don't we
get started with what's going on

88
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:28,028
now at Virtual Coffee? So- so
Dan is in his pumpkin jacket. So

89
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:31,298
I think it's appropriate if he
starts this conversation.

90
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:37,312
Dan: Hello, my name is Daniel T.
Pumpkins. Yes, I've- I've

91
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:42,023
started referring to this as my-
my pumpkin regalia. I don't know

92
00:05:42,028 --> 00:05:45,000
if I'm using that correctly, but
-- oh, we lost Kirk. He'll be

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
back. Oh, there he is. I don't
know where he went, but he's

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,002
back! Hello. So --

95
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:54,225
Kirk: My internet has been --

96
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:57,442
Dan: Alright. Well, hopefully
we don't lose you for good.

97
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:01,762
You're back for now. What is go-
oh, what is going on in Virtual

98
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:05,723
Coffee right now? It's
Hacktoberfest. And so, we've

99
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:08,300
mentioned this a couple times
on, I don't know if we've

100
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,752
mentioned

100
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:11,362
it recently on the pod. We've
been talking about it a lot in

101
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:14,872
Virtual Coffee. So
Hacktoberfest is a month long

102
00:06:15,502 --> 00:06:18,682
sort of celebration of open
source, right? And, it's --

103
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:22,958
originally, it's -- I mean,
originally and still is, run by

104
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,408
a company called Digital Ocean.
And they do a monthly thing

105
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:31,000
every year. And, the object is
really -- so for- for

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
contributors to submit four pull
requests in the month of October

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,548
and have them accepted, you
know, hopefully. And, if you can

108
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:41,978
hit that goal, then they, you
know, celebrate you and usually

109
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:45,517
send some swagger or something
like that as well. And they

110
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:48,127
do a really good job of doing
this and providing a lot of

111
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:51,548
resources for contributors and a
lot of resources for open

112
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:55,367
source maintainers and things
like that. And so, we, a couple

113
00:06:55,507 --> 00:06:59,918
years ago, decided to
piggyback on that and basically

114
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,007
help -- our- our idea two years,
three years ago, was to help our

115
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:07,700
members get, you know, get the-
the Hacktoberfest accomplished,

116
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,137
you know? And so that was --
yeah, that was three years ago.

117
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:13,358
We did this the first time in
Virtual Coffee and we had

118
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:15,848
a lot of fun. And last year we
had a- a huge number of people

119
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:19,612
join us and contribute a whole
bunch of awesome things to open

120
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:23,723
source projects. And we're
doing it again. And so, we have

121
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:27,142
add Virtual Coffee, we have a
Hacktoberfest, you know, room

122
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:30,000
where we have been chatting and
sharing lots of, like, open

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,642
issues and, you know, providing
help and support for people. And

124
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:37,000
we have the Hacktoberfest
coworking room, which is a

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,822
special version

125
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:42,233
of our coworking room. You
know, for people who are

126
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:49,463
Hacktoberfestering. And ... yes.
The word. And, what else's

127
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:50,000
going on?

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,500
Kirk: Festering.

128
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,700
Bekah: Yeah, I think it's just
festing.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:50,500
Dan: Hacktoberfestering.

129
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,700
Bekah: You're just festing.

130
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:52,700
Kirk: Yes.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Bekah: Hacktoberfesting.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,300
Dan: Mm-mm. I'm
Hacktoberfestering. And that's

131
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,093
-- listen. Who has the

131
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:08,000
jacket, okay? It's me [laughs].
And so, I make the rules, and I,

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,723
you know, all ... decisions come
through this jacket [laughs].

133
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:18,005
Kirk: When you invited me to
this podcast, I thought I was

134
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:21,300
coming up here as a creative
consultant. So, to hear this now

135
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,000
was really --

136
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,382
Dan: Mm. Well, you know, what
are you gonna do?

137
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:28,266
Kirk: Like, I'm executive
producer. So --

138
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:33,000
Dan: Yeah. And so, we're halfway
-- almost halfway through

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,462
October, and, you

139
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:37,000
know, we've had -- we -- I know
a lot of our members have been

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,552
doing some

140
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:41,722
contributions. We have our
traditional issue on the Virtual

141
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,863
Coffee site that people can
complete to, you know, get one-

142
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:51,023
one of their pull requests in
to start us off. We have some

143
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:56,182
videos on our site for some of
our Hacktoberfest things

144
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:59,663
that we've done so far this
month. And, yeah. Did I miss

145
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:01,673
anything about current event?

146
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:05,500
Bekah: [Laughs] Julia put in the
chat. Dan makes the rules. Bekah

147
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,898
controls the settings, and Kirk
is an unwitting victim, again.

00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:10,500
[Laughs] Sorry, Kirk.

148
00:09:12,758 --> 00:09:15,758
Dan: [Laughs] Sorry, not sorry.
Yeah. That's the --

149
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:20,541
Kirk: No, no. That captures our
dynamic pretty well. Julia is

150
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,740
right. She's insightful.

151
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:25,418
Bekah: I don't know. I feel like
I'm gonna push back a little bit

152
00:09:25,423 --> 00:09:26,827
against Dan makes the rules.

153
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:31,268
Dan: I mean, you can push back
all you want, but still, I have

154
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:33,967
the jacket and so what are you
gonna do?

155
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:36,000
Bekah: I --

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,500
Dan: Exactly.

157
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,092
Bekah: This is- this is how my
criminal story starts. I will

156
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:42,500
come and take-

157
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Dan: [Laughs] [Inaudible].

158
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,013
Bekah: -the jacket. If that's
where the power is, I will

157
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:47,302
acquire the jacket [Dan laughs].

158
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:52,625
Kirk: Before you came on the
stream back, I was saying like,

159
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:55,700
"Dan in that jacket." I dunno if
anybody remembers like "The

160
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:55,806
Mask"?

160
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:56,533
Bekah: Yes.

161
00:09:57,035 --> 00:10:00,635
Kirk: It's, you know, Stanley
Ipkiss. It's a similar sort of,

162
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:03,995
you know, there's this garment
in beauty of chaos and then he

163
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:06,700
knows he's not supposed to put
it on, but he does. Then he

164
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,745
becomes this

164
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:11,916
entity, you know? And then we
just all have to deal with it

165
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:16,000
until the jacket comes off. It's
like the Hulk, but for

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,291
Hacktoberfest. The
Hulktoberfest.

167
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:19,373
Dan: I feel like Hulk-

168
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:20,523
Bekah: Hulktoberfestering?

169
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,300
Dan: -loses clothes as he turns
into Hulk though, you know?

170
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,572
So [laughs] --

170
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:25,020
Kirk: That's true.

171
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:28,072
Bekah: So, the anti-Hulk?
[Chuckles]

172
00:10:28,403 --> 00:10:34,013
Dan: No, I'm not anti-Hulk. I
love Hulk. Also the shoutout,

173
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:36,743
"She-Hulk" has been really
awesome too. So --

174
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:38,998
Bekah: Octoberfest [??]. That's
exactly right, Tom Cudd.

175
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:45,442
Dan: Yes, Tom Cudd. And, yes.
So -- oh, Tom, I saw that you

176
00:10:45,472 --> 00:10:48,847
followed us on Twitch, I think.
I think I get emails for some

177
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:50,857
reason every time somebody
follows us. So, if you haven't

178
00:10:50,857 --> 00:10:52,717
followed us on Twitch, please
do. If you haven't followed our

179
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:55,500
podcast, you can find the
link on our site,

180
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,000
virtualcoffee.io. And follow-

181
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,300
Bekah: Slash podcast.

182
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,418
Dan: -us on Twitter too. Oh,
slash podcast, yeah.

181
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:03,697
There's links. But yes, slash
podcast if you wanna go

182
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:08,408
right there. We have a bunch
of people in the chat that we've

183
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:11,000
actually talked to on the
Virtual Coffee podcast, so,

184
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,118
that's kind of exciting.

185
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:16,087
Bekah: Yeah. And some of our
maintainers are here as well.

186
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:20,700
And contributors for
Hacktoberfest. So how's

187
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,278
everyone's Hacktoberfest

187
00:11:22,302 --> 00:11:26,248
going? Kirk, are you
Hacktoberfesting?

188
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:34,160
Kirk: I'm Hacktoberfesting in
the way -- and maybe this is

189
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:38,105
really relevant. I guess you've
had three Hacktoberfests before.

190
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:42,125
I had one where I was a
maintainer and that was super

191
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,616
cool. And I have one where I was
just a contributor and that was

192
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,700
also super cool. And this time,
I feel like most of what I'm

193
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:49,926
doing

193
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:53,046
has been mentoring. And that has
also been super cool. So I'm

194
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,586
really, you know, I'm doing all
the things. I'm the real -- I'm

195
00:11:56,586 --> 00:11:59,436
getting the full experience just
spread across three years and

196
00:11:59,436 --> 00:12:01,235
that's like totally okay, right?
Which I feel like has been the

197
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:04,505
real -- it's always sort of the
theme of Hacktoberfest, but

198
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:07,206
especially this time, you know,
like people are like, "What do I

199
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:10,000
do?" Or, "How to -- I'm like to
..." it's -- you can do whatever

200
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
you're comfortable with or
whatever you want. Or like, if

201
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,836
you do wanna

201
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:17,436
get outside of your comfort
zone, you know, like, there's a

202
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,975
difference between stepping
outside your boundaries or

203
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:24,000
pushing your boundaries and
like, jumping far away from it. 

204
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,336
Don't-

204
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:27,500
don't do that. But, you know, if
you can find a little way to

205
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,300
move it, then I think it's been
really good. It's been really

206
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,655
good. I think I'm --

206
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:34,500
Bekah: I feel like I take the
opposite approach, where I'm

207
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,572
very resistant

207
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:39,533
to doing many of the things in
Hacktoberfest. And then like two

208
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:44,000
days before, I suddenly decide
I'm going to do all of the

209
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,300
things. Let's start new
projects. Let's resur- resurrect

210
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,500
projects I haven't worked on

210
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,000
in a year. Let's mentor. Let's
contribute. I'm not really

211
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,043
sure why, but I can't help it.
I just, I- I can't not do the

212
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:04,072
things cuz they're just -- they
look so exciting.

213
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,500
Dan: Yeah. A-a-and I- I like-

214
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,000
Kirk: That's true.

215
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,562
Dan: -I- I'm kind of with that
too. It -- one of

214
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:12,832
the things is, one of the things
I like about this is that it ...

215
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:16,613
well, helps me, you know, having
like a date that a thing needs

216
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:19,972
to be done by or whatever helps
me do it. And that includes like

217
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:22,300
making a bunch of issues for the
rep- for the Virtual Coffee

218
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,700
site, for instance, you know? I-
I- I know in my head a bunch of

219
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,192
things

219
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:28,192
that need to be done and we can
use for an help on. It always

220
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:30,623
takes time and a little bit of
like mental energy to write

221
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:33,712
those issues and- and so
sometimes, they just, like, I

222
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,113
just -- they get put on the back
burner. But since we had

223
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:39,562
Hacktoberfest coming up, it
was a really good time to, you

224
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:42,352
know, put some effort into doing
that and- and creating those

225
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:44,572
issues. And it's been really
awesome having peep- having

226
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:49,673
people contribute back to
the site, you know? And we-

227
00:13:49,673 --> 00:13:54,173
we always have some contributors
throughout the year. But it-

228
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:56,932
it's ... I dunno. It's been-
it's been fun having a bunch of

229
00:13:56,932 --> 00:13:59,000
different people and all that,
like, shoo- should [??] -- kinda

230
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
goes to show, like,

230
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
creating -- create the issues,
and probably people will come

231
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,700
[laughs] and help out,

231
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,322
you know? As a maintainer, you
know what I mean?

232
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:10,043
It's- it's like, one of those
things where we now have a

233
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:12,052
bunch -- I mean, there- there's
the- the member issue that

234
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:14,212
everybody -- all of our Virtual
Coffee members are welcome to,

235
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:19,763
like, do. But the features and
stuff, it's- it's- you know,

236
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:23,123
they need to have the- the- the
options to work on, to do the

237
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:26,722
work, you know? And so, it's
been really fun kind of doing

238
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:29,243
back and forth with people and-
and getting some new stuff

239
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,743
going. So, I've been enjoying
that a lot.

240
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:35,888
Bekah: Tom says, it sounds like
we're learning from the current

241
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:39,500
Virtual Coffee book club,
"Start Finishing". Which ... I

242
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,300
wanted to get, but I couldn't
get in an audio book format. And

243
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,500
I knew, if I ordered a hard
copy, it would sit with all the

244
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,557
piles of hard copies of books
that ... I have yet to read.

245
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:52,582
Dan: Yeah. I need to --

246
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,500
Kirk: I have it in audio format.
That's the -- that's the only

247
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,000
way I could figure out how to
read. But I did find an

248
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,260
audiobook format and it is
really good.

249
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:01,432
Dan: Nice.

250
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:04,207
Kirk: I think I just found it
on, like, Audible.

250
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:08,197
Bekah: See, I don't have
Audible or understand how to use

251
00:15:08,197 --> 00:15:12,337
Audible. So I don't audible
things.

252
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:15,793
Dan: What?

253
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:18,863
Kirk: Let the be known Bekah
that all [unintelligible] call.

255
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:21,000
Bekah: Audible -- well, cuz you
have to like sign up for

256
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,500
Audible, right? And then you pay money for Audible, and then you

257
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,668
have to pay money for the books
too, right?

258
00:15:28,523 --> 00:15:32,000
Dan: Yeah. You get one free
month, pretty sure.

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,700
Bekah: That's not --

259
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,383
Dan: And then you can pay month
--

260
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,000
Kirk: Yeah, it like, you're
supposed to [unintelligible]

261
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,721
like you have a book token,
and you can, like, "Hey, here's

261
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:41,630
this token. Give a book." And if
you don't use your token for the

262
00:15:41,635 --> 00:15:45,000
month, they, like, stack up. And
if you want more books, more

263
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,431
than the token, then you have
to, like-

264
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:48,278
Bekah: Pay for them.

265
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:49,000
Kirk: -get those ... well, you
just have to, like

266
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,852
[unintelligible].

265
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:50,000
Dan: Yeah.

266
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,200
Bekah: Yeah.

267
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,852
Dan: But you pay for the tokens.
So all books cost the same

266
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:56,873
amount. It's one token. Anyway,
this is our Audible corner

267
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:57,000
[laughs].

268
00:15:58,268 --> 00:16:01,597
Bekah: We are not sponsored by
Audible. No, we won't be.

269
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,541
Kirk: If you'd like to --

270
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:04,538
Bekah: I'll never be sponsored
by Audible.

271
00:16:05,677 --> 00:16:06,217
Dan: My gosh.

272
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,000
Kirk: This is a weird [unintelligible] [laughs].

273
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,700
Listen. Any one out there, any
of the podcast sponsors, you

273
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:19,500
know, if you- if you sell
mattresses or shaving stuff or

274
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:19,530
--

274
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:21,700
Bekah: BetterHelp Therapy.
That's on all of my True Crime

275
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,523
podcasts.

275
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,000
Kirk: Datadog, if you're 
listening ... if you're

276
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,765
listening, Datadog, sure.

276
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:36,500
Listen. We're -- we are- we are
ready. Yeah, no. But the book --

277
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:42,300
I'd just to say like ... I've
been -- the- the process of

278
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,300
making -- and we talk about this
a lot, like, the process of

279
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,000
making our people ready for
contributions is a denses [??],

280
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,155
like, it's nontrivial. Evergreen
shoutout

280
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:54,125
to Nick Taylor. I love -- Nick
Taylor's been super active in

281
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:57,700
the Hacktoberfest channel. And
he and Jörn have their project

282
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,176
that they've

282
00:16:58,176 --> 00:17:00,605
been working on. But I also
really appreciate how like as

283
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,765
soon as Nick sort of like spots
something's wrong, I feel like

284
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,016
he's like, "Yeah, I should just
turn this into an issue." And he

285
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:10,355
just, like, does it. And I feel
like part of -- I probably make

286
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:12,546
things more than they need to.
In my head, I feel like I need

287
00:17:12,546 --> 00:17:15,246
to craft like the perfect issue
every time. And I feel like he's

288
00:17:15,246 --> 00:17:18,066
willing to just, "Well, I'll get
it up there. If I need to fix it,

289
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:20,286
I'll fix it later. But it's
there." And it's like, "Yeah,

290
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:24,365
you can grab this if you want."
And it may end up being that he

291
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:27,425
was -- the maintainer might end
up doing this thing, but it's

292
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:32,465
like, you gave people a chance,
like, try it. I don't know. That

293
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:38,076
sort of ties into one of the
aspects of having an open source

294
00:17:38,076 --> 00:17:42,200
repo is like that willingness to
let go. Like, I have to let

295
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,700
other people sort of like be a
part of this thing and they

296
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,000
don't think like me.

296
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,346
And like, I can put stuff in an
issue, but at the end of

297
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:52,715
the day, like they're the ones
figuring it out. And you sort of

298
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:55,566
have to be okay with that. And I
think, if you're somebody who

299
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:59,700
has ... I wouldn't say -- issues
is a weird -- if you have

300
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,566
difficulties of sort

300
00:18:01,736 --> 00:18:04,685
of like letting go of certain
things, like, making it open

301
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:08,076
source is a great way to realize
like, "Oh, I can't pour this cuz

302
00:18:08,076 --> 00:18:11,000
I'll -- like, I'll stress myself
out." You sort have to kind of

303
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
set it free and let it be a
community thing, an organic

304
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,586
thing. And it -- I

304
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,000
really like seeing -- yeah, like
the virtual IO website. Like, I

305
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
can really say, "Oh yeah, a
bunch of people have, like,

306
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,726
helped make this what it is and
it's really cool."

307
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:23,959
Dan: It is really cool
[chuckles].

308
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,700
Bekah: [Chuckles] I think, you
know, the idea of letting it go

309
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,413
and putting

309
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:34,084
it out there is a really good
one. Because I think too, like,

310
00:18:34,084 --> 00:18:38,074
sometimes as a maintainer or
somebody who's been working on a

311
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:41,104
project, you might get stuck on
an idea and somebody might come

312
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:43,443
along. They might have a better
idea or they might have a

313
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:46,233
different approach. And I think
that one of the fun things is

314
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:51,453
like keeping an open mind about
how- how people will understand

315
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:56,284
the project, and taking their
feedback, and building in a

316
00:18:56,284 --> 00:19:00,723
process to have that feedback.
Because it's not just about

317
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:03,423
helping and supporting
contributors. I think it's about

318
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:06,200
learning as a maintainer too.
And that's been one of my

317
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,453
favorite

319
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:10,183
parts. I actually think that my
favorite part of Hacktoberfest

320
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:13,500
for the last three years has
been being a maintainer and

321
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,314
being able to

321
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:18,700
interact with others and con-
the -- all of our contributors,

322
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,500
to learn from them and to hear
what they have to say about

323
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,500
things. And that was an
experience. The first year, I

324
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,203
know that I didn't- I

324
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:32,074
didn't realize how much I would
learn from being a maintainer.

325
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:36,099
Kirk: Yeah. I think that's a
great way to phrase it. Maybe

326
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:40,750
like entice people if you're
considering like, oh, like a lot

327
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,690
of people will frame this like,
"Oh, I don't know enough to

328
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,300
be a maintainer," right? I'm
like -- but if you have an idea

329
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:47,650
and you

329
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:51,519
wanna see it to a fruition, the
best way to learn about it might

330
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,960
be to, like, invite other people
to help you. And you just- just

331
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,500
get that for free. Like, you
get- get help, and you get

332
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,190
people who are gonna

332
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,619
teach you stuff, and you get to
finish the thing you wanted to

333
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:07,720
work on. Like, it's all- it's
all upsides here. And it's weird

334
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,819
where people work on a project
like, "Hey, thanks for letting

335
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:11,700
me work on this." I'm like, "You
just -- I didn't know how to do

336
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,000
that. That's why I made the
issue," you know? This is great.

337
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,500
Now I do. And it's done
[chuckles].

337
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,000
I wish I could do this for every
aspect of my life [chuckles].

338
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Like, my choice and other 
obligations, you know? It's like

339
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,769
-- or it's just all

339
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:28,869
the times where it's like, "I
don't know how to do this thing

340
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:32,700
and like doing it by myself
feels like a real struggle." And

341
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,500
we talk sometimes on the Slack
about, like, neurodiversity and

342
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,000
just, like, people having
different modes and the things

343
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,970
we have to do

343
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,869
sometimes just to figure things
out. And yeah, sometimes the

344
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:48,309
answer is, "Oh, I just- I just
need some help on this." An open

345
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,950
source feels a lot like that. I
wanna do this thing. I need some

346
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,000
help. And then, they help me.
Bekah, [Bekah laughs] no one

347
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,700
noticed that your camera went
off. I promise. Except everyone

00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,000
noticed.

348
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:58,961
Bekah: It left for a while. This
keeps happening. I did a live

349
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:02,000
stream before this. And I
couldn't give my camera to work.

350
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,700
And then, midway in the middle
of a sentence, mic -- I just

351
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,692
totally disconnected. It was- it
was awesome [chuckles].

352
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,166
Dan: [Chuckles] Hmm, alright.

353
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:18,300
Kirk: It started
[unintelligible]. We had this --

354
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,700
we were talking about, like, old
tech. And then we --

354
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,525
it just became, like, weird UIs.
And then just, like, all

355
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:28,825
the weird quirks of technology
that we have to deal with. And

356
00:21:28,825 --> 00:21:33,144
then I'm like, "Okay, cool. Now
that we've just been dunking on

357
00:21:33,144 --> 00:21:37,075
technology for the last 10
minutes, everyone here who works

358
00:21:37,075 --> 00:21:42,325
in this industry can get back to
talking about it." Sometimes --

359
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:45,384
but I guess, I don't know. It's
because we like the stuff, that

360
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:47,355
we also notice the stuff, and we
talk about it. But that's okay.

361
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:52,977
Bekah: I always love it when
people in the wild make a

362
00:21:52,977 --> 00:21:55,856
comment to me about technology.
They're like, "Oh, technology,"

363
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,926
you know? I'm like, "Oh, yeah.
I know." [Bekah and Kirk

364
00:21:57,926 --> 00:22:04,000
chuckle] Sorry. Those --

365
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,007
Kirk: Trust me.

364
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:07,557
Dan: Yeah, no. I- I said in the-
in the chat when we were talking

365
00:22:07,856 --> 00:22:10,916
during that discussion, there's
nobody that hates computers more

366
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:15,896
than developers. Like- like, it
took my- my wife a while to

367
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:18,500
really understand that, you
know? But now she's like, you

368
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,000
know, she'll have -- like, her-
her grandma

368
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,257
who asked if I could, like, help
her -- I mean, I don't --

369
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,557
I'm fine to help her. But like,
she's like, "Oh, he- he does

370
00:22:25,557 --> 00:22:27,297
computer stuff. He loves
computers." And she's like, "No,

371
00:22:27,297 --> 00:22:30,537
he- he hates computers." I'm
like- I'm like, "I really do."

372
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:33,000
[Chuckles] I'm like --

372
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:36,896
Bekah: I had a friend ask me to
help with her printer. And I was

373
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:41,000
like, "Oh, no, I don't- I don't
do printers. I- I -- when my

374
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
printer doesn't work, I just buy
a new one. Because that's easier

375
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,136
than trying to fix existing
printers.

376
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:52,700
Dan: I worked IT at- at ...
college. And you know, so the

377
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,300
job is mostly just like going
around to professor's offices

378
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,856
and fixing

378
00:22:55,856 --> 00:22:58,467
their stuff. And, yeah. We had
a rule. Like printers, you only

379
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:01,000
spend like five minutes trying
to fix whatever it is, and then

380
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
you throw it out and buy -- and
like, give them a new one. It's

381
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
like [chuckles] they're- they're
always just like -- printers are

382
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,436
nightmare.

382
00:23:07,497 --> 00:23:09,000
They always have been. They're
-- they still are. They -- I

383
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,700
don't know why they still are,
but they definitely are, you

384
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,000
know?

384
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:15,912
Bekah: I don't understand. I can
buy a printer and it works like

385
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:22,000
perfectly for 30 days. And then,
it like hits that mark, and it

386
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
just dies. It doesn't do any of
the things that it did before. I

387
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,721
feel like it's making a decision
to not work.

388
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:33,000
Kirk: If you're willing to
indulge in conspiracy theories,

389
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,859
there's a perfectly valid
explanation why not [laughs] --

390
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:37,362
Bekah: I am always here for the
conspiracy theories.

391
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,180
Kirk: But I was gonna say
this conversation, and it feels

392
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:46,704
like similar ones we've been
having for a while. Just about

393
00:23:46,704 --> 00:23:53,000
like -- and we said how vast
this -- like, tech is, as a word

394
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,234
means ... I

394
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:56,300
don't even know what it means.
It -- if -- like, it's just --

395
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,085
there's so much, and

395
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:59,845
it's- it's weird. Because we say
things like software developer,

396
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:04,224
and like, those are two words.
Yes. I don't know what those

397
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:10,075
mean. And they have very little
to do with what my job is.

398
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:13,914
And then, like, words like full
stack or front end or backend,

399
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:18,654
it's like that's still so
incredibly vague as to be almost

400
00:24:18,654 --> 00:24:22,164
ultimately useless. Like, it
doesn't -- I don't know what you

401
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,000
do when you say that, at all. I
could guess, and I would

402
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,394
probably be wrong.

402
00:24:26,471 --> 00:24:29,092
Dan: Yeah. We- we actually spent
our entire hour today at Virtual

403
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:32,392
Coffee talking about that exact
thing. Mostly, cuz I said in my

404
00:24:32,392 --> 00:24:36,082
intro that I don't like the word
full stack. And -- when I was

405
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:38,632
talking about myself, you know?
And like, I don't feel like it's

406
00:24:38,632 --> 00:24:42,862
very descriptive for what I do.
And then that started a whole- a

407
00:24:42,862 --> 00:24:44,192
whole thing [laughs]. But
[unintelligible].

408
00:24:44,346 --> 00:24:47,217
Bekah: So instead of saying full
stack, you just say you do

409
00:24:47,217 --> 00:24:48,116
things with computers.

410
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:50,382
Dan: Yeah. At the --

411
00:24:50,412 --> 00:24:52,031
Bekah: That's much, much better.

412
00:24:52,122 --> 00:24:54,821
Dan: At -- yeah, yeah. At
coffee, I ended up with, "I do

413
00:24:54,821 --> 00:24:56,652
typey, typey." So, that's
[all chuckles] --

414
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,700
Kirk: You know, it's like
explain it like I'm five, the

415
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,700
subreddit. It's like, "What a
computer programming?"

415
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,000
Like, "I do typey, typey." And
then you just see what's that.

416
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,509
Recently, I've been saying --
I've been, like, very specific.

417
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,700
It's like, "Oh, I write
JavaScript sometimes, and

418
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,000
TypeScript sometimes, and Python
sometimes, and SQL sometimes.

419
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,300
And sometimes I'm clicking

419
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,490
buttons in the GUI [??]. And
that's- that's what I do right

420
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:28,300
now. That will probably change
in two months, or six months, or

421
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,640
something.

421
00:25:28,842 --> 00:25:29,000
Bekah: I was-

422
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,500
Dan: Yeah.

423
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,192
Bekah: -at the hospital with one
of my kids. They had to

422
00:25:33,192 --> 00:25:38,652
get a test. And the hospital
intake person asked, she was

423
00:25:38,652 --> 00:25:42,700
like, "Well, what do you do?"
And in my mind, what- what she

424
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,211
really

424
00:25:43,211 --> 00:25:45,942
wanted was just like a job title
so she could put it down on the

425
00:25:45,942 --> 00:25:49,000
form, right? And I was like 
[chuckles] -- but she said,

426
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,892
"What do you do?" And so,

426
00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:55,811
I was panicked because I'm like,
"How do I explain what I do?" I

427
00:25:55,811 --> 00:26:00,000
do things with the computer and
code and community and education

428
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and- and I'm like ... went on
this long tangent about what I

429
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,500
did [laughs]. I was like, "Oh,
my title. It's technical

430
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,592
community builder." It was like,

430
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:13,602
really, really -- I- I don't
think that she was ready for

431
00:26:13,602 --> 00:26:15,491
that at five thirty in the
morning on a Saturday [laughs].

432
00:26:18,017 --> 00:26:20,906
Dan: Yeah. It's -- yeah, I can-
I can feel that whole thing

433
00:26:20,906 --> 00:26:24,000
happening every time somebody
asks me and or every time I have

434
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
to do an intro at Virtual
Coffee [laughs]. It's like --

435
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm like, "Well, do I do the
half hour discussion version,

436
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,287
or do I just

436
00:26:31,287 --> 00:26:36,000
say I do computer things?" Yeah.
Well, Jesse- Jesse was saying,

437
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,537
"Yeah, if the --

437
00:26:36,537 --> 00:26:41,156
i-if you talk to somebody in --
that are in tech, then you'd be

438
00:26:41,162 --> 00:26:43,527
more- more descriptive. And if
it's somebody that doesn't know

439
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:45,356
anything, you say, 'I build
websites and apps.'" And that's-

440
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:47,186
that's mostly what I do too.
Yeah. So, I --

441
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:49,241
Bekah: I don't do any -- I don't
do that though [chuckles].

442
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:52,000
Dan: Well, right now, I mean,
you know, yeah. It's- it's a

443
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,672
little -- but you have a job
title, right? That you forgot-

00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:55,000
Bekah: Yeah.

444
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,700
Dan: -about? But, like, at least
you have that to fall-

444
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,000
Bekah: That does make it much
difference.

445
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,700
Dan: -to fallback on --

445
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,300
Bekah: Well, she didn't ask me
my job title. She said, "What do

446
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,000
you do?" [Chuckles]

00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:02,700
Dan: [Chuckles] Right.

446
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,700
Bekah: Which to me is like, "Now
I have to tell a story of the

447
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,821
thing that I do." I'm not
[chuckles] --

447
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:10,000
Kirk: Like a who are you? Like,
as a-

448
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,300
Bekah: Right?

449
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,009
Kirk: -person? And yeah, I
will write it in this form.

448
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:13,839
There's a section for it.

449
00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:15,971
Bekah: Well, it felt like she
wanted my bio [laughs].

450
00:27:18,162 --> 00:27:19,071
Dan: [Laughs] So --

451
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,019
Kirk: Yeah. I mean --

452
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:20,612
Dan: Oh, go ahead, Kirk.

453
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,000
Kirk: Well, Dan, like you, and
then, if I think of, like, how

454
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Bekah would describe her role,
if I think of how it -- there's

455
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
-- the overlap -- like, there's
overlaps. But I don't -- I make

456
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,300
an app for people who make apps
and websites, you know? So like,

457
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,700
it's a very -- it's very
similar-

458
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,000
Bekah: A Meta app maker?
[Chuckles]

459
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,839
Kirk: -but I don't know. Just
... oh, yeah. It's ... I've

458
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:49,300
been trying to, like, sneak the
word meta into, like, all

459
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,000
aspects of my life cuz it just
feels cooler if you can, like,

460
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
"Oh, I did it like a Meta way."
It's cool.

461
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:54,951
Dan: Sponsored by Meta?
[Bekah chuckles]

462
00:27:55,089 --> 00:28:02,700
Kirk: Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I mean [exhales], if they're

463
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,300
tired of React, and they want
something else that's, like,

464
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,730
super cool ... I'm just saying.
Give the whole podcast.

465
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:12,461
Dan: Next time we- next time we
talk, Kirk's gonna show up with,

466
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:15,311
like, the NASCAR outfit and the
hat, you know? And the, like,

467
00:28:15,372 --> 00:28:17,500
the jersey and stuff. Except
it's all just gonna say Meta

468
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,192
all over place [chuckles].

468
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:26,700
Kirk: I cannot describe to you
how foreign the entire concept

469
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:32,700
of NASCAR is to every aspect of
my life [chuckles]. But it looks

470
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,000
cool.

471
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,500
Dan: As long [??] --

470
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,700
Kirk: But yeah. But -- just to
say, I guess, Hacktoberfest,

471
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,000
also, I feel like did that in a
big way of --

471
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,279
sometimes, especially in online
spaces, you feel ... what's

472
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,500
that word? Well, it- it feels
like everyone around you sort of

473
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,000
like doing the same thing. Or
you get that feeling like

474
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,859
everyone's doing the

474
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:53,349
same thing. And then, you start
comparing yourself to everyone

475
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:56,400
else. Cuz you're like, "Ah,
everyone knows about, like,

476
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,730
React. Why I not know about
React?" Like, everyone knows

477
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:59,700
about Git. It's like, "Why I
not know about Git?" Like, these

478
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,000
things. There's certain things
that we just talk about more.

478
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,589
And you start, like, comparing
yourself

479
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:07,000
to other people. "Oh, everyone
knows about AWS. Why don't I

480
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,220
know about AWS?" And

480
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:13,619
Hacktoberfest was like a real,
like, good reminder that there's

481
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:19,300
a lot going on here. You can
only know like 1% of 1%. Like,

482
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,500
the very thinest

482
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,025
slice. And you prob- like, what
you have more in common of

483
00:29:24,025 --> 00:29:26,994
people is what you don't know
than what you know. So when it

484
00:29:26,994 --> 00:29:29,300
comes to open source, like,
you're going to feel like a

485
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,265
beginner in some

485
00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:33,000
things and you're going to feel
better in other things. And

486
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,300
like, that's -- everyone's doing
that all at the same time. And

487
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,000
you really shouldn't- you really
shouldn't, like, compare

488
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,500
yourself to others. That they
have

488
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,490
a whole life of experiences that
have led to, like, where they

489
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,599
are and what they feel good at.
And if you actually ask them,

490
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,500
they probably feel like you.
They probably, "I also do not

491
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,700
know what I'm doing. And I also
feel like everybody else online

492
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,500
knows more than me. And I also
feel like, you know, I'm just

493
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,000
..." How did Julia's daughter describe it? As staring at the

494
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
screen for a couple minutes and
hitting Ctrl+Z 75 times. That is

495
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,700
how I feel all the time
[laughs].

495
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,259
That is my job. But yeah,
Hacktoberfest is a

496
00:30:14,265 --> 00:30:17,440
really good reminder of that in
a way that doesn't feel like

497
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:20,109
destructive, but like, feels
really healthy. You know, like,

498
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,480
we're all ... trying to figure
it. It's like- it's like, for

499
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:26,300
one month, everyone tries to
figure something out and, like,

500
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,000
we all accept that we're trying
to figure it out. And ... that's

501
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,490
great.

501
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:34,500
Dan: Yeah, totally. A-and like
the -- this is just -- we talk

502
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,067
about this

502
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,406
every- every time we talk about
Hacktoberfest. But like, there's

503
00:30:37,406 --> 00:30:42,500
a lot of ... I don't know.
There's a lot of, like, social

504
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,000
things that go around with
contributing to open source ...

505
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,166
projects too. And

505
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:48,807
that- that -- like, that is
something that causes anxiety

506
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:52,227
for me, you know? Especially-
especially when I hadn't really

507
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:55,856
done much contrib- you know,
open source contributing before

508
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:57,700
I worked as a developer for a
long time, before I ever, you

509
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,646
know, did any

509
00:30:58,646 --> 00:31:01,196
open source stuff. And that's
one of the things that we try to

510
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:04,737
push here too. Like, with our-
with our thing is not just like,

511
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:07,700
oh, writing code or whatever.
But how to- how to, like, engage

512
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,826
in a community — an open source
community, whether it's a big

513
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:13,700
one or a small one. And, you
know, how to- how to navigate

514
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,547
that without feeling --

514
00:31:14,817 --> 00:31:17,396
I mean, I- I suppose you're
always gonna feel nervous the

515
00:31:17,396 --> 00:31:19,406
first time you do something, but
hopefully we can, you know, help

516
00:31:19,406 --> 00:31:22,886
you kind of get a -- go along
and- and- and do it. And so

517
00:31:22,892 --> 00:31:26,700
that's- that's one of our other
... I don't know. One of- one of

518
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,700
the other things that we- we try
to, like, concentrate on is-

519
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,500
is just helping

519
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,951
people kind of start that
journey, you know? Cuz once-

520
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:35,300
once you get a couple under your
belt, it becomes -- i-it, like,

521
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,011
it opens

521
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:38,622
your eyes to all the things you
can do. And everything else

522
00:31:38,622 --> 00:31:40,692
becomes a little more possible
if- if you've done it a couple

523
00:31:40,696 --> 00:31:43,301
times, you know? Maybe in a
controlled environment like

524
00:31:43,692 --> 00:31:44,281
at Virtual Coffee?

525
00:31:45,442 --> 00:31:48,642
Bekah: Well, it's nice too that
we have maintainers who are

526
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:53,951
members. Because they might be
maintaining a project for fun,

527
00:31:53,957 --> 00:31:56,801
for Hacktoberfest to help
people get in. Or they might be

528
00:31:56,951 --> 00:32:02,142
maintaining a larger project for
work. But I think that when you

529
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:06,700
see other people who you know in
those larger projects, let's

530
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,700
say. And you have some
experience doing the things that

531
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,000
we do at Virtual Coffee,

531
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,402
then it helps to, like, create
that path to being able

532
00:32:15,406 --> 00:32:18,791
to take on things that maybe you
would've been too scared of

533
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:22,271
before, or, you know, to go
outside of Virtual Coffee to do

534
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:24,500
the things. And I think that,
you know, decreasing those

535
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,000
barriers to entry, providing
support and mentorship, and that

536
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,300
community excitement around
things goes a long way to

537
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,500
improving the experience of
everybody who's involved in open

538
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,551
source contributions.

538
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:44,833
Kirk: Yeah, it reminds me not to
get to Meta [??]. But ... I've

539
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,000
been, like, re-binging -- I've
been binging like all the

540
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,623
episodes of

540
00:32:47,623 --> 00:32:55,000
the podcast. And I was listening
the one with Julia. Which is

541
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,500
one, as I to- it's- it's the
most chaotic episode [chuckles].

542
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,000
It's just like, the first 20
minutes is so off the rails.

543
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,700
It's Doubloon, Dan, which

543
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:08,837
is my -- one of my favorite
Dans [??], you know? But you all

544
00:33:08,837 --> 00:33:11,417
were talking about like teaching
and concept of teaching. What

545
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:14,500
feels good about teaching,
right? And like, the -- that

546
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,000
moment where you helped

546
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,472
somebody else, like, truly gain
insight, right? Not just

547
00:33:22,472 --> 00:33:24,212
like you told them something,
they're like, "Yeah, okay." But

548
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:26,000
like, you, like, explain
something, or you show them

549
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,522
something or

549
00:33:26,522 --> 00:33:28,500
you help them, and they like-
they like, say like, "I get it."

550
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,700
And like, this real moment of,
like, pride and joy. And just,

551
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,300
like, self-validation. That
feels really good, you know?

552
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,000
That feels like a ...

552
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,468
it almost like -- I almost wanna
say that it's like an almost

553
00:33:42,468 --> 00:33:45,738
fundamental human experience.
You feel it like when you're

554
00:33:45,738 --> 00:33:48,498
with your kids or with family or
like, you know, like, young

555
00:33:48,498 --> 00:33:50,500
people where it's like, "I
helped you figure out a thing

556
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,317
and I can, like,

556
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:55,188
watch that happen." So I feel
like Hacktoberfest also has a

557
00:33:55,188 --> 00:33:58,038
lot of those moments where like,
you're on either side of it. But

558
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:01,488
it's like, we both did this, and
now there's like a real --

559
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:05,208
something just got like better,
you know? Like, this person

560
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:07,700
learned something. Like, I
helped them. I love that

561
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,700
feeling, you know? Like, I
would -- I'd do that all day. Or

562
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,557
I wanna do that

562
00:34:12,557 --> 00:34:17,500
all day. So, that -- I think
that's like my fave- I love,

563
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:23,000
like, it -- that -- it's- it's
a real -- a lot of like --

564
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,047
Hacktoberfest for me is like

564
00:34:24,077 --> 00:34:27,347
really, like, vicarious. Like,
I can't always, like, jump into

565
00:34:27,347 --> 00:34:29,800
stuff. But if I'm just hanging
out in the Slack it sounds like,

566
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,378
"Hey, this

566
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:32,867
person helped this person figure
this out." They're like, "Hey, I

567
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:35,000
didn't know Git stuff. Can
someone help me with Git?"

568
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
This is great. Like, I could
just -- I'm just --

568
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,500
this is like [laughs] -- this
is my television. I don't know.

569
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,000
This is like my ... I can't
think of like a thing that I

570
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,300
like more than just like
watching people go, "Oh, I

571
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:47,853
figured this

571
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:50,700
thing out." And then, like, the
double up like, "Oh, someone

572
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:56,000
else helped me figure this thing
out." That feels- that feels

573
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
like all of it really -- and
like everything we do from, you

574
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,700
know, the- the podcast, or like
the videos, or even having like

575
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,697
the- the one big pairing thing,
or doing stuff together, or like

576
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:11,177
the website, it gets all seemed
-- like, we're all funneling

577
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:14,800
towards making that moment,
like, super achievable for

578
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,157
people, right?

578
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:19,000
Cuz like that's the thing where
you go like, "Oh, actually I'm

579
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,700
not, like, worse than everybody
else." "Oh, actually I think I

580
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,500
do like this-

580
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,807
this work and this field that
I've chosen to do," you know?

581
00:35:26,807 --> 00:35:29,688
"I do feel like I belong in this
space." Like, it's those moments

582
00:35:29,688 --> 00:35:33,500
to make this happen. And we
talked about a little bit in VC

583
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,652
today of like,

583
00:35:35,612 --> 00:35:40,532
you know, so much- so much
for a lot of people of the

584
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:43,382
developer experience, especially
when it gets -- it's like, just

585
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:46,322
developing alone. Just, like,
figuring it out by yourself.

586
00:35:46,322 --> 00:35:48,700
It's just like you, you're
online, and it's all by

587
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,672
yourself. And there's nothing,

587
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:55,472
like, wrong with that. But it
also feels really good when

588
00:35:55,472 --> 00:35:58,500
you can do stuff with other
people. And I feel like

589
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,000
sometimes that's the difference
between ... yeah, I wanna keep

590
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
going at this, or, yeah, I
don't. It's not like you

591
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
couldn't have done it or you're
not capable.

591
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,500
But just ... things are better
sometimes if there's other

592
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,577
people to work on. Like, it's
just, I'm trying to think of

593
00:36:13,577 --> 00:36:16,700
what if ... football — not
saying soccer. You can't make

594
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,000
me — which is like a one on one
sport [chuckles],

594
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,700
same 90 minutes, same field, but
just one person.

595
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,077
And that's kind of how it feels
when you're working on a

596
00:36:27,077 --> 00:36:30,887
problem by yourself sometimes.
Just like, "This is so ... much.

597
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:34,700
I can't finish." But if like 10
other people, then it feels

598
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,700
better. The football, that is.
Not- not soccer. For anyone

599
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,927
else. Football.

599
00:36:42,818 --> 00:36:46,300
Dan: I- I like that analogy 
[chuckles]. I do. I'm getting

600
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:46,898
distracted cuz, like,

600
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:50,737
Bekah seems like she really has
something to say, or is --

601
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:53,000
maybe there's an animal loose in
her room. I'm not sure [Dan and

602
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,518
Bekah chuckle]. But

602
00:36:54,518 --> 00:36:56,797
if you're listening to this
later, Bekah is just like

603
00:36:56,802 --> 00:36:59,128
losing her mind, while Kirk
is talking [laughs].

604
00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:02,500
Bekah: It's just- it's just --
I'm- I'm struggling because I'm

605
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,788
really tired and I didn't

605
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:08,000
get a cup of coffee before this.
And like, I'm- I'm definitely

606
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,907
into this conversation and I'm
just having a hard time

607
00:37:12,913 --> 00:37:17,498
with -- dealing with the
physical symptoms of tiredness.

608
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:24,248
Sorry. I'm sorry. I might go get
a cup of coffee [chuckles].

609
00:37:27,487 --> 00:37:28,157
Dan: [Laughs] Oh, man.

610
00:37:29,557 --> 00:37:33,398
Bekah: Well, also, this is -- I
had a meeting today, and then I

611
00:37:33,402 --> 00:37:37,000
live streamed, and this is the
second livestream. And I- I am

612
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,700
sorry that I -- this is the
third- third person -- people

613
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,788
interaction that

613
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:46,688
I've done of the day because you
got -- they had me at my best in

614
00:37:46,688 --> 00:37:54,398
the first meeting. Now I'm ...
whatever this two-o'clock-Bekah.

615
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:58,146
Kirk: Dan, when she give her the
jacket, she needs the coffee.

616
00:37:58,146 --> 00:37:58,500
Bekah: Thank you.

616
00:37:58,378 --> 00:38:00,967
Dan: Hmm. Pass [chuckles].

617
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:07,000
Kirk: You pass? [Chuckles] Maybe
think about it for more than two

618
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,641
seconds, Dan.

618
00:38:07,887 --> 00:38:09,958
Dan: Hmm ... pass.

619
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:14,007
Bekah: Tom Cudd has given me
permission to go get coffee. So

620
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:19,197
that's what I'm going to do. So,
you can talk, and I will mute,

621
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:21,257
and go get my coffee. And then
I will be fine.

622
00:38:23,157 --> 00:38:25,213
Dan: Okay. This is ... that's
fine [laughs].

623
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:32,501
Kirk: Ooh, Julia. Hollywood. So,
Julia just mentioned Hollywood

624
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:36,356
Squares in a chat. And I feel
like I've spent the last two

625
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,266
years not seeing the parallels
between every Zoom meeting and

626
00:38:39,266 --> 00:38:42,300
Hollywood Squares. And it's
weird that there hasn't been,

627
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,000
like, more of an intersection
between those two concepts. But

628
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,436
we can explore that at another
time.

629
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:55,242
Dan: [Chuckles] Alright. Well,
Bekah is gone. So, Kirk would --

630
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,000
Kirk: She's [unintelligible].
I'm like [??] -- I guess I'm

631
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,626
Bekah now.

631
00:38:58,722 --> 00:38:59,500
Dan: No, you're- you're- you're-

632
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,000
Kirk: Again.

633
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Dan: -Kirk. Should we just talk
about TypeScript?

632
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,693
TypeScript Tuesday's takeover
[laughs]?

633
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:07,000
Kirk: [Laughs] Now we're here.
We're just [inaudible]

635
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
TypeScript Tuesdays. I mean, we
can talk about TypeScript in

636
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,581
the- in the frame

636
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:16,061
of reference of Hacktoberfest.
Sort of like a manifestation of

637
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:18,550
everything we've been talking
about, right? You and I have been

638
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:21,700
sort of learning how to use
TypeScript together in a

639
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,001
codebase and we've been working
on it. Bekah really changed.

640
00:39:25,108 --> 00:39:30,958
Dan: [Laughs] A wild Jesse
sighting.

641
00:39:35,425 --> 00:39:39,000
Kirk: This remind me ... there
was a time -- see, I feel like

642
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,000
in the early days of Virtual
Coffee, eons ago, I feel like we

643
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,700
did not go one VC meeting
without Bekah being, like,

644
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,000
Ashton Kucher punked by at least
one of her kids.

645
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:58,500
Dan: Yeah.

646
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,130
Kirk: And there was a day where
you locked

645
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,590
your door, you're like, "I've
locked the door. They can't come

646
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,501
in." And then they opened the
window. And you could just hear

647
00:40:05,505 --> 00:40:09,280
the sounds of children spilling
in through the windows.

648
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:13,527
Bekah: So, my- my bedroom has
doors to it. But they don't go

649
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:16,797
anywhere. They open up and
there's like a railing there. So

650
00:40:16,797 --> 00:40:21,358
you can't get through. And so
they climbed up the house. They

651
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,438
pushed like a playset, and
climbed a story up, opened the

652
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:29,487
door, and came into the bedroom
because I locked them out.

653
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:33,568
Kirk: It's called manifesting
your dreams.

654
00:40:33,568 --> 00:40:37,500
Bekah: Yesterday I had a
meeting. And my 6-year-old came

655
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,500
in to tell me during the meeting
that my 8-year-old was twerking

656
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:48,000
at her. I'm like [laughs].
Hashtag momlife [chuckles].

657
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,500
Dan: Oh, god. That is amazing.
Is that the new-

658
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
Kirk: That's [unintelligible].

658
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,500
Dan: -is that the new 
my-sister's-staring-at-me? For-

659
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,277
for the modern day?

659
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:04,000
Bekah: I -- it must be. It must
be. Yeah. I hate when people

660
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,038
twerk at me too.

661
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:10,088
Kirk: With me is fine. But acne
is unaccept.

662
00:41:10,585 --> 00:41:13,346
Bekah: I -- so, I'll take you on
a tangent. I might have told

663
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:17,300
this story before, but never on
a recording. When I was in

664
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,000
college, I went

664
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,056
to Prague for spring break with,
like, the business group, and

665
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:26,936
we went to this dance club. And
this guy was tickling my armpit

666
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,000
while I was dancing. And I was
like, "Is this some kind of

667
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
thing that they do in Prague?"
And I don't know who was at

668
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,985
Virtual Coffee

668
00:41:33,985 --> 00:41:36,496
when I told the story. And
they're like, "This is- this is

669
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:40,315
definitely not something that-
that they do in Prague. That guy

670
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:46,000
was just really weird." Cool
[laughs]. Now you all know about

671
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,556
it too.

671
00:41:46,556 --> 00:41:50,500
Kirk: [Unintelligible] say
[laughs]. I'm just -- I don't

672
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,000
know what I thought you were
gonna say, but that- that wasn't

673
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
it. I particularly marked it
wasn't what I thought-

673
00:41:55,956 --> 00:41:56,500
Bekah: I- I don't even know-

674
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,000
Kirk: -and you thought.

675
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,500
Bekah: -how to respond to that.
I still don't know. And this is,

674
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,000
like ... many years later 
[chuckles]. How do you respond

675
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,300
to someone tickling your armpit
on the dance floor? Go ahead and

676
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,755
throw that in the chat.

677
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:15,068
Kirk: That's an interesting
question. Maybe when he was

678
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:20,096
six and his sibling was eight,
they twerk at him. And he --

679
00:42:20,096 --> 00:42:21,500
Dan: That's a good question.
Were you- were you twerking at

680
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,000
him? It's in response to some
of the, you know?

680
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,880
Bekah: I was most assuredly not
twerking at him [chuckles].

681
00:42:31,606 --> 00:42:33,000
Dan: [Laughs] I mean, yeah.
There's different kind -- I

682
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,500
mean, there- there's, like,
twerking at somebody where you

683
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,800
want them to dance with you, and
there's twerking at somebody

684
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,700
where you're trying to bother
them, right? And so-

685
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,000
Bekah: I don't-

686
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:42,500
Dan: -I feel like there's --

687
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,900
Bekah: -I don't know how to
twerk, okay? [Laughs]

686
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:47,500
Dan: [Chuckles] Well, obviously
you have somebody in your house

687
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:47,700
that could teach-

688
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,700
Kirk: Dan, wait.

689
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,655
Dan: -you. So --

688
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,500
Kirk: Hold on [??]. Dan, it
feels like you're saying that

689
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,300
of like -- I mean, like- like
the- the sort of like father-kid

690
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,733
moment. Well, there's different
types of twerks.

690
00:42:59,126 --> 00:42:59,635
Dan: That's right.

691
00:43:01,994 --> 00:43:02,483
Kirk: This one will twerk at
you, menacing you.

692
00:43:02,576 --> 00:43:02,936
Dan: Right.

693
00:43:03,653 --> 00:43:05,300
Kirk: But then there's one
people twerk at you, in a

694
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,000
positive way.

694
00:43:05,545 --> 00:43:06,500
Dan: Yeah. Invitingly, right?

695
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,500
Kirk: You know? And it's
[inaudible].

695
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,175
Dan: That's when you tickle
their armpits [laughs].

696
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:14,000
Bekah: [Laughs] You should just
never tickle someone's armpits.

697
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:22,795
I'm a firm believer in not
tickling armpits. [Dan laughs]

699
00:43:22,795 --> 00:43:23,500
So, hopefully nobody-

00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,000
Dan: Yeah.

700
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Bekah: -is tickling your
proverbial armpits on your 

701
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,846
Hacktoberfest repository
[laughs].

701
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,000
Dan: There she is. The master of
segues [laughs].

702
00:43:37,344 --> 00:43:40,000
Kirk: But also, like, your real
-- I -- like, not -- it doesn't,

703
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,500
you know,

703
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,300
metaphorically or not, probably-
probably, no? I don't think you

704
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:50,000
need to, like, put it in a code
of conduct. But ... [Bekah

705
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,500
laughs] maybe, after that guy
went to that- that dance place

706
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,500
in Prague, they put it on their
code of con- you know, on the

707
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,500
door, like, you know, no --
like, 'Must wear

707
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:04,000
shirt, no armpit tickling', you
know, 'Don't torture people'.

708
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,700
Proverbial Armpit is an
excellent band name, Tom. You

709
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:14,000
are right. I think, when we
decided to do this- this one

709
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,300
live, we thoroughly did not
anticipate

710
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,108
the fact that we would have to
talk while reading chat.

711
00:44:20,528 --> 00:44:23,889
And as everyone here knows,
that is very difficult for us.

712
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,121
Dan: I- I mean ... yeah. I- I,
you know, we -- there's been a

713
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:34,000
couple comments in the- in the
chat about ... yes. You

714
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,300
shouldn't -- just-

714
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,221
just in general life rule, don't
tickle strangers armpits,

715
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:42,700
you know? You want them -- any
armpit tickling to be ...

716
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,700
consensual [Dan and Bekah
laugh]. All right, hold on.

717
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,496
There's a delivery person
walking in right now [laughs].

718
00:44:51,068 --> 00:44:51,659
Kirk: That's perfectly --

719
00:44:51,835 --> 00:44:53,000
Dan: That was really well timed.

720
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Kirk: Okay, cool.

720
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,300
Dan: Well, I got my package 
delivered. Well, hopefully he

721
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:57,700
walked out with the-

722
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,000
Kirk: He --

723
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:00,700
Dan: -knowledge -- you know,
the- the wisdom to not tickle

722
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:04,496
people's armpits that haven't
given- given prior consent.

723
00:45:05,186 --> 00:45:06,500
Bekah: Can -- we need --

724
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,500
Kirk: Same [unintelligible].

725
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,700
Bekah: Listen. We need a sticker
in the Virtual Coffee store

724
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,246
that- [laughs] that talks about
that.

725
00:45:17,155 --> 00:45:19,500
Dan: [Chuckles] If somebody
makes that sticker, I will put

726
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,000
it on the store.

727
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,000
Bekah: Yes.

728
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,545
Dan: I- I promise.

727
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,300
Bekah: And we also need a
structured YOLO sticker. We're

728
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,000
about to run a contest or
something to get those in there.

729
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,700
Dan: Ooh.

729
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,300
Bekah: Ooh, make an issue for
arm tickling [laughs]. I really

730
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,425
enjoy derailing the
conversation.

730
00:45:37,826 --> 00:45:41,425
Dan: [Chuckles] Yes. No. Kirk-
Kirk said, yes. Imagining the

731
00:45:41,425 --> 00:45:43,496
delivery person walking in,
seeing my jacket, and talking

732
00:45:43,496 --> 00:45:47,815
about armpit tickling ... in- in
a stream. Yeah, no. I- I imagine

733
00:45:47,815 --> 00:45:51,300
that- that gentleman will be
sharing that story [laughs] when

734
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,155
he gets back f-from the shift.

735
00:45:55,193 --> 00:45:58,000
Kirk: I'm gonna say -- so, I
mean, you're probably, like, you

736
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,700
don't even place on, like, the
weirdest events that have

737
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,000
happened while he's delivering
things, right? Like, so-

738
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,500 
Dan: Yeah. That's true.

738
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Kirk: -you know? I always, like,
to remind myself of that

739
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,300
sometimes whenever I'm like,
"Oh, was that weird or awkward?"

740
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:14,300
I'm like, "It doesn't even rank
on the things happening in the

741
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,500
world." Bekah got armpit-tickled
in real-life. In Prague. You

742
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,000
know?

742
00:46:19,706 --> 00:46:20,300
Bekah: Real armpit-

743
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:20,500
Dan: What?

744
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:20,876
Bekah: -tickled.

745
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,500
Kirk: Bekah, again, the segue
thing. I don't know how to-

746
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,700
I don't know how to say --

744
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:29,724
Bekah: I used my segue. And
then, nobody followed it up.

745
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:33,516
Kirk: It- it didn't take, you
know, like some -- when you have

746
00:46:33,516 --> 00:46:33,500
like a lighter-

00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:33,700
Bekah: Yeah.

00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,700
Kirk: -and you do the first
flick, and like, it just does

747
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,177
[inaudible] like the matches --

748
00:46:37,289 --> 00:46:40,344
Bekah: It's hard to have two
armpit tickling segues though.

749
00:46:42,907 --> 00:46:45,088
Kirk: If anyone can do it, it's
you. I believe in you.

750
00:46:45,088 --> 00:46:45,759
Dan: I have faith.

751
00:46:47,963 --> 00:46:49,500
Bekah: Speaking of armpit
tickling-

752
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,300
Dan: There it is [laughs].

752
00:46:50,543 --> 00:46:53,000
Bekah: -what have been your
uncomfortable moments ... in

753
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,293
your Hacktoberfest history?

753
00:46:57,817 --> 00:46:58,206
Kirk: Oh.

754
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:00,300
Dan: Oh, you know, actually
that's a -- that's ... hey,

755
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:00,849
Bekah. That's

755
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:04,000
a really good question and a
wonderful segue. Thank you.

756
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,688
This is actually something I was
gonna talk about before you

757
00:47:07,693 --> 00:47:11,318
left to get a cup of coffee in
the middle of our stream

758
00:47:11,768 --> 00:47:12,500
[laughs]. It was- it was --

759
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,000
Bekah: You said I could.

760
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,449
Dan: Yeah, okay. Well, that's
fair. Is ... you said

759
00:47:19,509 --> 00:47:22,000
uncomfortable moments, eh. And
there- there are some, like --

760
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,039
so, we were talking about the
positive sides of, you know,

761
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:29,559
becoming a maintainer, and- and-
and open sourcing your project,

762
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:32,079
and- and doing that things. And
it's from a- from a maintainer

763
00:47:32,469 --> 00:47:35,500
standpoint. There are, like, you
know, it- it- it can be hard

764
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:40,000
too, you know? It- it can be,
like, difficult to navigate

765
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
sometimes. And again, here's,
like, the social issues are more

766
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,409
of problem

766
00:47:44,409 --> 00:47:47,438
than, like, the technology or
code parts of it. You know what

767
00:47:47,438 --> 00:47:52,989
I mean? Is how to ... navigate
some of that stuff. And- and

768
00:47:52,989 --> 00:47:57,000
like, as a person who is not
always the best ... I don't

769
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,500
know. Like, I alway- [laughs] I-
I- I don't know. My reactions to

770
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,309
things are, you

770
00:48:03,309 --> 00:48:04,700
know- you know, usually --
sometimes, like, my reactions

771
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,648
come out, like, you

771
00:48:05,648 --> 00:48:07,599
know, you have a gut reaction
to something, and then you,

772
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,300
like, realize that, "Oh, okay.
Let's, you know, think about

773
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:09,878
this for a

773
00:48:09,878 --> 00:48:11,918
little bit." And, you know, it
took me a while to figure out

774
00:48:11,918 --> 00:48:17,000
that I needed to pause before I,
[chuckles] you know, before I

775
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,978
let any gut

775
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,018
reactions, like, come through or
whatever, and think through some

776
00:48:20,018 --> 00:48:22,974
things, and, you know, help-
help communicate with that. But

777
00:48:22,974 --> 00:48:26,153
it's like, I- I- I think, the
biggest part of that is- is

778
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,583
communication. Alright. I'm
sorry. I glanced at the chat in

779
00:48:28,733 --> 00:48:31,700
[unintelligible] just like
[laughs] ... Bekah, you are the

780
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,700
one that was trying to segue us
back over here. And the -- I

781
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,500
feel like, you know, you're not-
you're not helping us for --

782
00:48:36,858 --> 00:48:38,469
Bekah: I didn't say anything. It
was Kirk.

783
00:48:38,664 --> 00:48:42,000
Dan: Oh, yes. You were giggling,
and chatting [chuckles], and ...

784
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,700
you know? It's just sometimes
hard to- hard to concentrate.

785
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,824
But, you know. I don't really
have any idea what I was saying.

786
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:53,500
Bekah: Responding to people
in communication and taking-

787
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,500
Dan: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

787
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:59,329
Bekah: -a step back before going
with your gut feeling. See?

788
00:49:00,744 --> 00:49:04,673
Dan: Yes. Exactly. So, anyway,
communication skills important.

789
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:08,000
But it is a very good place to
do practice those and get

790
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,300
better. I've be- I have become
a- a much better -- I mean,

791
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,204
certainly a much

791
00:49:12,204 --> 00:49:17,094
better open source maintainer
since the first time I did it,

792
00:49:17,094 --> 00:49:22,700
was when we started this thing
three years ago. And, you know,

793
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,494
over the last three years have-
have, like, learned a ton, you

794
00:49:25,494 --> 00:49:28,700
know? And I'm -- I feel much
better about doing it now than I

795
00:49:29,994 --> 00:49:29,994
... looking

795
00:49:29,994 --> 00:49:31,853
back, than I did, you know? I
felt confident about it going

796
00:49:31,853 --> 00:49:34,463
into it in the first place. But
that's where you- you just like,

797
00:49:35,153 --> 00:49:37,974
i-it's just one of those things
where the only way to really get

798
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:42,534
good at it is to do it. And
that's why -- that- that's just

799
00:49:42,534 --> 00:49:44,500
why I'm- I'm always, like,
behind Kirk. Like, what Kirk was

800
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,700
saying was, you know,

800
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,844
it's a great time to -- like,
this is a great time to do

801
00:49:47,844 --> 00:49:50,844
it because we have, like, all of
our resources are pointing

802
00:49:50,844 --> 00:49:53,213
towards that. I mean, not our,
like, resources on our site. But

803
00:49:53,213 --> 00:49:56,664
all of Virtual Coffee right now
is doing Hacktoberfest stuff, you

804
00:49:56,668 --> 00:50:00,054
know what I mean? And we have a
ton of support for

805
00:50:00,353 --> 00:50:04,764
maintainers and stuff as well.
And those- those -- that's --

806
00:50:04,824 --> 00:50:07,193
that support exists all- all
year round, you know? If you're

807
00:50:07,193 --> 00:50:08,994
thinking about open sourcing a
project, doesn't have to be

808
00:50:08,998 --> 00:50:12,384
right now, obviously. But it's a
good time to do it and you'll

809
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:17,000
have -- probably have --
instantly have people that wanna

810
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,188
contribute if you have a project
that's open source during

811
00:50:21,878 --> 00:50:24,500
Hacktoberfest. So, I dunno.
That's- that's my little bit is

812
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,059
... you know-

812
00:50:25,074 --> 00:50:26,900
Bekah: My goal this year is to
maintain-

813
00:50:26,563 --> 00:50:27,099
Dan: -jump in and do it.

814
00:50:27,534 --> 00:50:31,134
Bekah: -the momentum beyond
Hacktoberfest, right? Like, to

815
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:36,054
continue to do open source
projects and to work with other

816
00:50:36,054 --> 00:50:41,364
people at Virtual Coffee or, you
know, outside of our community,

817
00:50:41,364 --> 00:50:45,700
and keep moving these things
that I'm really excited about

818
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,000
forward. And I think that, you
know, hopefully we can build

819
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,494
some of

819
00:50:49,494 --> 00:50:52,884
that accountabi- some of that
accountability into Virtual

820
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:56,724
Coffee for other maintainers who
want that support and

821
00:50:56,963 --> 00:51:02,304
contributors beyond Virtual
Coffees VCHI — Virtual Coffee

822
00:51:02,304 --> 00:51:06,114
Hacktoberfest Initiative, and-
and just keep going with it.

823
00:51:06,114 --> 00:51:10,313
Because I think it is a really
great way to learn more about

824
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:13,704
how to contribute, how to be a
maintainer, to work on that

825
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:16,000
communication because
communication can be really

826
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
hard. And so, you know, this is-
this is the start of it. And

827
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,063
we're gonna keep going.

828
00:51:20,873 --> 00:51:23,700
Kirk: We call VCHI [v-chai],
VCHI, also because it's- it's

829
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:28,224
a reference to the word chai as
like another coffee time?

830
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:29,231
Bekah: Yep.

831
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:29,905
Dan: No, I don't --

832
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:30,500
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

833
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:30,700
Dan: Yep [laughs].

834
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,460
Bekah: That's exactly what were
thinking.

833
00:51:34,253 --> 00:51:37,000
Kirk: Great. That's a great
idea. And we were super smart

834
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,494
for thinking

834
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:43,000
about that. But also, yes so --
to everything that- that you

835
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,300
said, like, the sustain ... I
don't know. I- I think, I spend

836
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:53,000
a lot of time thinking about,
like, sustainability in many

837
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:00,000
ways. I feel like a lot of the
things in my life, like, I can

838
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,998
get this, like,

838
00:52:00,998 --> 00:52:07,000
big burst of energy and do a
flurry of activity, and then --

839
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,700
but then, all that energy, like,
goes away and then I'm like, "Oh

840
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,688
no. What do I do now? That thing
I used to do, all this stuff is

841
00:52:13,688 --> 00:52:19,000
gone." And you know, like, that
sort of -- a lot of the stuff

842
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,443
we've been talking about in this
community just in general, and

843
00:52:21,443 --> 00:52:26,000
reading, like, about, like,
having to not rely on, like,

844
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,500
inspiration slash motivation,

844
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,000
and how to, like, turn things
into processes and routines

845
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,733
that either, like, provide you
what you need to make things

846
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:40,284
sustained or like, just lowering
the barrier on yourself for what

847
00:52:40,284 --> 00:52:42,623
you have to put into things to
get, like, the outcomes that you

848
00:52:42,713 --> 00:52:46,000
want. So, yeah. I feel like
that's a really good ... I

849
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
dunno. That feels like a really
good goal and I should probably

850
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:57,300
do the same thing. Yeah. And you
know, if we also -- if Segway

851
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,438
wants to sponsor, I'm not --
today, do they still make those?

852
00:52:59,606 --> 00:53:03,266
Bekah: Yeah. I saw people, like,
riding around them in a Segway

853
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:04,525
pack in Pittsburgh.

854
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,000
Dan: [Whisper] Segway pack?
[Chuckles]

855
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,389
Kirk: [Chuckles] I don't know.
That's the collective noun.

855
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:12,161
Bekah: The flock? [Chuckles]

856
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:16,989
Kirk: A herd.

857
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:17,960
Bekah: A herd. A herd of Segway.

858
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,500
Kirk: A herd of Segways. It's
like when Dan was in that- that

859
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:30,500
group of his when he was a kid.
The ... Little [??] Kids of Bad

860
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,278
Town. I dunno. That sounds [??]
fun.

860
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,190
Dan: Yeah, that's it. What did
you say it was? [Dan and Bekah

861
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:37,000
laugh]

861
00:53:40,643 --> 00:53:43,014
Kirk: I've been -- every time I
mention -- I think this is like

862
00:53:43,014 --> 00:53:46,000
the fifth time. And every time
[laughs] I try and say a new

863
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
name, it's like Benedict ...
Cumberbatch. Like, you can't

863
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,700
say his real name. You have to
say, like, Bumblebee Pumpkin

864
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,300
Patch. Like, you -- there's no
-- why would you -- you know,

865
00:53:54,300 --> 00:54:59,000
I mean, you know, like, you're
not -- the whole point ...

866
00:54:59,000 --> 00:54:02,844
anyway. It's fine. Dan was in a
scooter gang.

867
00:54:03,036 --> 00:54:05,300
Dan: It was not a scooter gang.
At that point, I'm going to --

868
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:08,500
I'm not gonna yes on that. I've
-- I don't ride scooters. I am

869
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,865
not interested in that. It's a
mountain bike gang called the

870
00:54:13,195 --> 00:54:17,000
Sugar Hill Pumpkin Patch Crew
[Dan and Bekah laugh]. I dunno.

871
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:23,500
I try to remember what you said.
But we were awesome. So, you

872
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,700
know ... what are you gonna do?
Yes. Rebecca says mountain bike

873
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,291
for the win. Yes. Agree.

873
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:35,851
Kirk: No, maybe Bekah was right
about getting more coffee. I saw

874
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:41,700
MTV, and I was like, "Major
Trifecta Baseball?" I- I could

875
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:47,851
not put that together. Okay. Now
the chat's just talking about

876
00:54:48,331 --> 00:54:50,700
bikes, and Jesse says the bikes-

877
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,838
Dan: Jesse, how dare you?
[Dan and Bekah laugh]

878
00:54:50,882 --> 00:54:51,601
Kirk: -are just low --

879
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:57,349
Dan: Jesse says, "Bikes are just
low tech scooters, right?" And I

880
00:54:57,378 --> 00:54:58,668
did that say, "How dare you,
sir." [Chuckles]

881
00:55:01,427 --> 00:55:06,436
Kirk: Bikes are just overly
engineered unicycles, you know?

882
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:06,916
Like --

883
00:55:08,673 --> 00:55:12,273
Bekah: Yeah. It's interesting
how bikes are so much like open

884
00:55:12,273 --> 00:55:14,700
source contributions, right?

885
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:14,900
Dan: No.

886
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,100
Kirk: [Chuckles] That's --

887
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:15,300
Dan: No.

00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,000
Bekah: Like, you gotta learn how
to get on the bike, learn how to

885
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,300
ride the bike, and how to
maintain momentum. And that's

886
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,300
what we're trying to do here
[chuckles]. C'mon! It wasn't too

887
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:26,884
bad [laughs].

887
00:55:27,409 --> 00:55:30,858
Dan: I wish I had- I wish I had
my soundboard here. Yes, I

888
00:55:30,858 --> 00:55:32,809
would've air horned that one.
That one was awesome [chuckles].

889
00:55:36,226 --> 00:55:38,000
Kirk: I mean, [inaudible] just
for Bekah segues, we would like

890
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,237
[inaudible] a very specific
sound.

890
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:44,000
Dan: Just like a crowd cheering-

891
00:55:43,577 --> 00:55:43,907
Kirk: I wonder --

892
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:45,228
Dan: -sound or something, you
know?

893
00:55:47,974 --> 00:55:48,700
Bekah: I'm here for it.

894
00:55:48,436 --> 00:55:50,500
Kirk: Is it possible to do,
like, an entire presentation of,

895
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:55,700
like, only segue? I guess you
can't be only segue, right?

896
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,700
Because, like, a segue is like
a conjunction. So, like, you-

00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,300
you need-

00:55:59,300 --> 00:55:59,500
Dan: Yeah.

897
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,000
Kirk: -things to combine --

898
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,300
Dan: Right.

899
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,700
Bekah: Well, I think I beg you
--

897
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,139
Dan: You could write an awesome
segue between each slide

898
00:56:03,139 --> 00:56:04,909
or something if you're doing a
talk, if that's what we're

899
00:56:04,909 --> 00:56:05,719
talking about, you know?

900
00:56:05,884 --> 00:56:10,000
Bekah: I think you -- I- I would
argue that you only need to

901
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,300
start with one ... thing. And
then, the entire rest of the

902
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,974
presentation could be rolling
segues.

903
00:56:20,302 --> 00:56:24,300
Kirk: Right. Because a segue can
segue from one segue to another

904
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:24,661
segue.

904
00:56:24,918 --> 00:56:26,179
Dan: S-s-speaking of rolling
segues [laughs] --

905
00:56:29,702 --> 00:56:30,061
Kirk: Functional programming.

906
00:56:30,259 --> 00:56:39,000
Dan: Functional programming.
Yeah. I -- segues make me think

907
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,500
of the "White & Nerdy" — Weird
Al — music video, which is

908
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,500
amazing if you ... listen.

908
00:56:43,813 --> 00:56:47,554
Bekah: My 8-year-old listens
to that, like, every single day.

909
00:56:48,634 --> 00:56:50,000
Julia- Julia is going to --

910
00:56:49,351 --> 00:56:50,311
Kirk: That's where you run to
tour.

911
00:56:50,643 --> 00:56:53,434
Bekah: Great. Julia's got some
really good extensions here.

912
00:56:53,434 --> 00:56:56,000
It's easy to buy a bike. But you
need someone to help you learn

913
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,583
how to

913
00:56:56,583 --> 00:57:01,384
maintain it. Absolutely right.
It's easier to keep up the

914
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:04,653
routine maintenance and get the
most out of your bike investment

915
00:57:04,804 --> 00:57:08,300
if you have other cyclists
around to mentor you and ride

916
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:12,500
with you. This is great. There's
an entire blog post right here

917
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,393
in the chat. Somebody just needs
to put it together.

918
00:57:17,206 --> 00:57:20,266
Kirk: And then you can tie in
that phrase to tech people say

919
00:57:20,266 --> 00:57:23,686
sometimes. Bike shedding. And
it all --

920
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Bekah: Is that really a thing?

920
00:57:24,543 --> 00:57:26,914
Dan: We're bike shedding- we're
bike shedding the segue.

921
00:57:26,956 --> 00:57:27,347
Kirk: Yeah.

922
00:57:27,347 --> 00:57:27,600
Dan: Yeah.

922
00:57:28,083 --> 00:57:28,503
Bekah: I don't know what mean.

923
00:57:28,503 --> 00:57:30,500
Dan: Just like dog fooding.
And --

924
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,000
Bekah: Ooh.

924
00:57:32,206 --> 00:57:34,157
Kirk: Well, see. I specifically 
didn't say that one.

925
00:57:34,293 --> 00:57:37,300
Dan: I wouldn't say that one.
Shotgun food. Food- food

926
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:37,800
gunning.

927
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,000
Bekah: Cat treating?

928
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:45,137
Dan: Cat treating. And ...
[chuckles] no.

---

926
00:57:45,137 --> 00:57:47,700
Kirk: No, no. Like, bike
shedding is real. It's a real

927
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:52,000
phrase that people actually say.
It is far more tolerable than-

928
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,300
than [inaudible].

928
00:57:52,684 --> 00:57:55,000
Dan: I'm very curious to know
why it's a bike shed and not,

929
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,773
like, some other

929
00:57:55,773 --> 00:57:58,474
kind of shed. So bike shedding,
for those of you who don't know,

930
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:00,994
is in computer — when- when
you're talking about it with

931
00:58:00,994 --> 00:58:03,300
development — it's, like,
spending all of your time and

932
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,023
resources on

932
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:06,963
this thing that's sitting on the
side instead of your house,

933
00:58:06,969 --> 00:58:09,333
right? Like, so, like in the
metaphor, your house is like the

934
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:12,364
actual app or whatever you're
working on. And the bike shed is

935
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:15,393
just this, like, little thing on
the side. And you're, you know,

936
00:58:15,634 --> 00:58:17,853
you're making your bike shed
really fancy, but not working on

937
00:58:17,853 --> 00:58:21,000
your house. Like, that's the-
that's the -- I don't use the

938
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
term, but that's what the term
means [chuckles].

939
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Kirk: Yeah. [Inaudible]-

940
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,719
Dan: But, like, why bike shed
and not, you know --

941
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Kirk: -[inaudible] doing it.

939
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:34,429
Dan: But like, is a bike shed a
thing? Do people have?

940
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:36,500
I suppose they probably do
somewhere.

941
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,500
Kirk: I'm guessing
[unintelligible] wash.

941
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:42,300
Dan: I dunno. But like, yeah.
Well ... I'm just saying. Of all

942
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:46,300
the things to choose for that
metaphor, why a bike shed, is my

943
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:46,759
... question.

943
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:50,000
Bekah: Because maybe they're
up for-

944
00:58:49,099 --> 00:58:50,148
Dan: Speaking of bike sheds
[laughs] --

945
00:58:50,248 --> 00:58:51,329
Bekah: -a bike ... gang
[chuckles].

946
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:57,528
Dan: Oh, yeah. Yak shaving. I
don't remember what that one

947
00:58:57,528 --> 00:58:58,500
means. I have to [inaudible]
that one.

948
00:58:57,889 --> 00:59:00,000
Bekah: Don't ... use that out
loud. That's -- this is a-

949
00:59:00,289 --> 00:59:00,500
Dan: Oh, is that-

949
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,300
Bekah: -family podcast
[chuckles].

949
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,228
Dan: -is that a -- am I- am I
getting code of conducted?

950
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:05,858
[Chuckles] Alright. Alright.

---

951
00:59:05,902 --> 00:59:09,700
Kirk: I think, my next
Hacktoberfest project will be a

952
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:14,300
bot that just takes like random amount [??] [chuckles], and then

953
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,700
one of these things, and just
puts it together, and then just

954
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:21,000
makes up some sort of nonsense
definitions. It's like these are

955
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,777
all the tech terms. I put them
all in this bot, you know?

956
00:59:24,184 --> 00:59:24,664
Dan: I love that.

957
00:59:25,067 --> 00:59:26,956
Kirk: What was that one you said
earlier? Cat feeding?

958
00:59:28,204 --> 00:59:29,594
Dan: Cat treating. I think she
said.

959
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:31,039
Bekah: Yes, that's what I said.

960
00:59:34,077 --> 00:59:39,300
Kirk: Yeah. Now we -- that'll be
my next project. I feel like we

961
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:43,000
can -- slowly but surely, I feel like we have managed to talk a

962
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,300
little bit about OSS and open source. And I feel like, for

963
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:51,500
those of you listening and
watching, if you take anything

964
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,577
away from this, it

964
00:59:52,577 --> 00:59:58,637
is that ... we really enjoy this
time. And in many ways,

965
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:03,692
Hacktoberfest is the thing that,
like, really solidified a lot of

966
01:00:03,692 --> 01:00:09,601
parts of Virtual Coffee. It was
how the maintainers sort of like

967
01:00:09,601 --> 01:00:15,000
became the maintainers. It
was how we, like, normalized a

968
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,500
ton of things. It was how we,
like, set the direction for a

969
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,000
ton of things.

969
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,996
It was how I think a lot of us
made the decision to -- this

970
01:00:22,996 --> 01:00:26,000
wasn't -- like, this was like,
oh, this is -- VC is like a

971
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:26,700
thing that we

971
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,016
wanna keep doing. And like, it-
it exists as, like, a space that

972
01:00:30,016 --> 01:00:32,600
can do a lot of good, you know?
In addition to, like, the

973
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:32,927
personal

973
01:00:32,931 --> 01:00:36,586
good was doing for us, but just
like- just like a really good

974
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:41,686
thing to be, like, kept and
maintained. So we- we care about

975
01:00:41,686 --> 01:00:44,000
it a lot. And we're really
excited that it's still

976
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,047
happening. We're

976
01:00:45,047 --> 01:00:47,536
still sort of feeling the way we
felt about it at the beginning.

977
01:00:48,137 --> 01:00:51,500
Because at the end of the
day, like, Hacktoberfest really

978
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,000
isn't about the, like,
individual projects we're

979
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
working on. It's about the collaboration with other people.

980
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,500
And the only reason I managed to
get through any of that is

981
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,700
because I explicitly did not
read whatever Julia just posted

01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,700
about ostriches. I saw that
word, and I turned away. And you

983
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:06,884
should be proud of me.

982
01:01:06,884 --> 01:01:08,673
Dan: I'm proud of you. It's
impressive.

983
01:01:09,108 --> 01:01:12,858
Bekah: You did an excellent job,
Kirk. You did a much better job

984
01:01:12,858 --> 01:01:16,500
than Dan and I normally do on
the podcast wrapping things up.

985
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,700
So, I- I think-

986
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,000
Dan: Yeah.

987
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,500
Bekah: -it's probably a good
time to wrap up and think about

986
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,358
what Kirk said.

987
01:01:24,634 --> 01:01:27,300
Dan: I always think about what
Kirk said. I spend the most of

988
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,594
my time [inaudible]-

988
01:01:27,842 --> 01:01:28,561
Kirk: I never think about
[inaudible].

989
01:01:28,594 --> 01:01:32,434
Dan: -about what Kirk says.
Yes, I know. I mean, I just also

990
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:36,889
like to add, I mean, thank you
to everybody that is here

991
01:01:36,889 --> 01:01:38,500
today, and thank you to
everybody who's been

992
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,619
contributing to

992
01:01:39,619 --> 01:01:42,259
Ha-hacktoberfest, and listen to
our podcast, and hanging out in

993
01:01:42,259 --> 01:01:46,159
Virtual Coffee. Like Kirk said,
this is like -- I mean, this

994
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:49,000
is my favorite time of the year
for- for Virtual Coffee stuff.

995
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,708
The Hacktoberfest stuff is
really exciting for me. I love

996
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,500
open source stuff in general.
I'm gonna say stuff a few more

997
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:58,000
times in this sentence, and then
I'll wrap it up. But [chuckles]

998
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,878
I don't know.

998
01:01:58,878 --> 01:02:01,938
It's- it's just a good time and,yeah, has- has a special

999
01:02:01,938 --> 01:02:04,989
place in my heart too. Because
of the reasons Kirk said,

1000
01:02:05,148 --> 01:02:07,668
sort of the genesis of a lot of
the things that are actually

1001
01:02:07,668 --> 01:02:11,119
happening in Virtual Coffee now.
And it's the-

1002
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,588
Bekah: Including the podcast?

1003
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,289
Dan: -a good -- including the
podcast and the website itself

1004
01:02:15,289 --> 01:02:18,259
didn't exist. We -- I made it so
that we could have that issue

1005
01:02:18,829 --> 01:02:23,449
to have people add themselves
as members. And so, like, a

1006
01:02:23,454 --> 01:02:26,148
lot of stuff- a lot of stuff
came out from- from- from

1007
01:02:26,148 --> 01:02:29,119
Hacktoberfest v1. VCHI v1. So --

1008
01:02:30,259 --> 01:02:33,539
Bekah: We are grateful for
everyone here and for this

1009
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:34,668
Hacktoberfest season.
