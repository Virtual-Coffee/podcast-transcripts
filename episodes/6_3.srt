00:00:05,136 --> 00:00:08,696
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season six, episode three of the

2
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:13,746
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:13,746 --> 00:00:17,527
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:20,527
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:23,196
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:26,137
stories in what they've learned.
And we are here to share with you

7
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:28,867
here with me. Today is my co-host
Dan

8
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,207
Dan: Wuddup, Bek!, how's it
going?

9
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:33,726
Bekah: It is amazing.

10
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:37,356
Dan: I'm serious. It, it, uh, it
just gives me so much energy

11
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:40,087
coming in like that. I can't,
can't, uh, I can't do anything

12
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:40,656
else anymore.

13
00:00:42,832 --> 00:00:44,121
Bekah: it is what it is,

14
00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:51,606
Dan: Um, yeah. So today we are
continuing our streak of awesome

15
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:55,996
guests. Um, that started season
one, episode, one um, with, uh,

16
00:00:56,046 --> 00:01:01,597
Seth Hall, Seth is a technical
product owner at Uniform and, um,

17
00:01:02,152 --> 00:01:04,941
So one of the questions you might
ask is what does a technical

18
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:08,391
product owner mean? And I'm glad
you asked that because Seth

19
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:10,852
talked about it, he explained
what that means and why he's so

20
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:15,412
happy in that role is sort of a
organic transition for him, um,

21
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:19,162
from being, um, you know, a, I
was gonna say regular developer,

22
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:22,162
but that's not, fair, but you
know, being an individual

23
00:01:22,162 --> 00:01:26,962
contributor developer to, um,
this new role as a product owner,

24
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:28,552
it was really cool to hear. Yes,

25
00:01:28,686 --> 00:01:31,927
Bekah: well, and I love too, he
talked about his transferable

26
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:36,516
skills as a creative producer. So
his background in filmmaking and

27
00:01:36,516 --> 00:01:40,537
how he brought that over to what
he's doing now, which for me was

28
00:01:40,537 --> 00:01:43,746
a really interesting exploration
of, you know, overlapping that

29
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:47,677
creative process with what he's
doing as a technical product

30
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:47,956
owner.

31
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:53,751
Dan: absolutely. The, um, the
idea of a producer in, you know,

32
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:56,242
everybody's heard of a producer
in, in the entertainment industry

33
00:01:56,242 --> 00:02:00,816
and movies and TV. Of course,
there's not always a lot of

34
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:04,387
clarity about what a producer
does, in it for a movie. Um, but,

35
00:02:04,777 --> 00:02:08,796
but the, uh, oh man, now I can't
remember what kind of producer he

36
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,287
said is the one that does what
he's doing. Do you

37
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:11,752
Bekah: Creative

38
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:15,097
Dan: Creative producer. Okay. And
so a creative producer is a

39
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:18,007
person who's kind of responsible
for shepherding a, the, the

40
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,736
project, you know, from beginning
to end and make a lot, make

41
00:02:20,736 --> 00:02:24,937
connections between people and,
um, doing a lot more than. You

42
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,396
know, maybe a project manager or
something like that role kind of

43
00:02:27,396 --> 00:02:32,766
role. Um, and it was really cool.
And I, I love the, uh, I love

44
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:36,157
that idea and I, I love like
placing these, these, uh,

45
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:39,037
frameworks, mental frameworks
from other industries on top of

46
00:02:39,037 --> 00:02:43,507
dev stuff and, and seeing how we
either have a role that's like

47
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:45,787
that. And it's just name
something different or, or maybe

48
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:50,257
something, you know, the, the dev
can actually use to be become

49
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:53,287
better. You. And I think, I feel
like creative producer here is

50
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:56,796
like one of those, one of those,
like really cool. It, it, like, I

51
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:59,467
dunno, it seemed like a very cool
idea to me. Yeah,

52
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:01,641
Bekah: And I love how he talked
about, he used the phrase,

53
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:05,872
intimate collaboration, and I
think that that sums up what

54
00:03:05,872 --> 00:03:10,342
really makes somebody good at
that job. But that's one of those

55
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:13,731
things that it's, it's not a
common phrase or a common idea

56
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:18,442
when you're thinking about what a
technical product donor does or a

57
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:22,132
producer. but that those
connections are what really allow

58
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:23,301
people to be successful.

59
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:27,336
Dan: absolutely. Uh, it was, it
was cool. It was very good

60
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:27,637
talking to.

61
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,461
Bekah: Yeah. And we start this
episode of the podcast. Like we

62
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,602
start every Virtual Coffee with
our names where we're from what

63
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:39,711
we do and answering a random
checking question. So we hope you

64
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:51,300
enjoy this episode. Today's
random. Check-in question is

65
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:55,110
describe a time you laughed so
hard. You thought you would cry

66
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,419
or when you did cry. I'm not sure
if that makes sense. What was so

67
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,810
funny? Um,

68
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,889
Dan: Did you read that question
before? Just now? what is,

69
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:10,860
Bekah: did, when we were setting
up the, the podcast, when

70
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,060
scheduling everybody, I put
questions in all of them. So it's

71
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,735
been a minute. Um, My name is
Bekah. I am a technical community

72
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:29,925
builder and laugh so hard that I
cried. I feel like these, those

73
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:34,305
moments are great and I can
remember them happening and who

74
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:39,285
they happened with, but I cannot
remember why they happened. So

75
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:45,360
like normally. With people I'm
very close friends with or with

76
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,589
my brothers, usually it's my
brothers. Um, and I'm usually

77
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:55,230
laughing at them and not with
them. so I don't know. I'll have

78
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:59,819
to think about that more, but I
guess I'm laughing, so, oh, I'm

79
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,310
trying to think. There was one
that was recently I was laughing

80
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,500
so hard. I don't know. I have to
come back to it. Send it over to

81
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:07,980
you, Dan.

82
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,834
Dan: Um, alright. Hello. My name
is Dan. I am. From Lakewood,

83
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:17,375
Ohio, the first suburb west of
Cleveland, I do web development.

84
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:20,555
And, uh, yeah, I have, I have
these, I have these laughing

85
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:23,964
issues from time to time. Um,
honestly, mostly with my family.

86
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:27,235
I don't, I don't know exactly
why, but, uh, yeah. And my mom

87
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:29,725
gets it too. So sometimes I'll
just like have to cover my face

88
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:34,254
and, you know, be laughing a lot
and probably crying again. Uh,

89
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:41,300
the one time that really, um, uh,
comes to mind, uh, Have you guys

90
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,680
seen the, like the screaming goat
videos, uh, like that were like a

91
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,990
popular a while ago. And, um,
there's so there's one, that's

92
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,589
like a, so people started mixing
'em into songs, you know? And

93
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:55,339
the, and there's like this, the,
the Taylor swift song, the, um,

94
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:00,199
that's like the, I know you were
trouble or how's that song go

95
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:02,600
some there's some, but there's.

96
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,230
Bekah: in.

97
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,615
Dan: There's some part of that
hook and then there's the

98
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,185
screaming goat. And, uh, it like
just kills me every time. And I,

99
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:12,004
we were like playing it on my
phone, you know, with my family

100
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,495
in like the living room. And I
just like, I could, like, I was

101
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,134
laughing for probably like 15
minutes. Cause my sister started

102
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:19,384
just every time I'd calm down,
she'd played again,

103
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,170
Bekah: There, there was a, um, I,
it was an Instagram real, or a

104
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,139
TikTok that was similar where
somebody was going to film

105
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,279
themselves. And while before they
got started, they accidentally

106
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:35,750
like threw their hip into the
side of a bed and they screamed

107
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,470
out and then everybody remixed
it. So they screamed like, ah,

108
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,040
and so then people are like, eh,
you know, like staying alive. Ah,

109
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,500
it would start with that. And
then somebody would go on. That

110
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,519
was really good.

111
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:51,274
Dan: All right. Wait, I think I
can, uh, I, I think I can, oh,

112
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:54,485
can I change my microphone while
we're recording? Is that

113
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:58,834
possible? Might not be possible.
Uh, I was gonna play it for

114
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,305
everybody, but I don't think

115
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:01,865
Bekah: Link link in the show
notes.

116
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,970
Dan: I'll put the link in the
show notes so that we don't I'll

117
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,540
have to listen to me breaking
down again. probably a good call.

118
00:07:08,884 --> 00:07:12,574
Bekah: I used to laugh so hard
when we started the podcast.

119
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:17,600
Dan: Yes. That was always fun. It
was fun making that happen.

120
00:07:17,764 --> 00:07:18,185
Seth: maybe or

121
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:19,910
Bekah: It was, it was like
straight up

122
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:20,779
Seth: light syndrome.

123
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,050
Bekah: Dan would be like, go and
I'd start. The intro could not

124
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,079
hold it together. Could not, it
took me like, even if I was

125
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:30,680
recording it by myself, it took a
really long time. Maybe season

126
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:32,329
two is when I finally calmed
down.

127
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:33,125
Dan: Yeah.

128
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:33,800
Seth: yep.

129
00:07:34,535 --> 00:07:38,045
Dan: Yeah. I also like the like
times where you are really not

130
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:40,444
supposed to laugh, but you're
like standing in front of

131
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:43,235
somebody, whatever. But you make
eye contact with one of your

132
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:45,694
friends or, you know, somebody
who knows you're trying not to

133
00:07:45,694 --> 00:07:47,884
laugh or whatever. Those are
always really fun for me too.

134
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:49,055
Except when I'm.

135
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,230
Seth: good, that's a good segue
into mine. My name is Seth hall.

136
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,521
I'm a technical product owner at
Uniform. And for me, laughter has

137
00:07:56,521 --> 00:08:00,841
been a huge part of my life. Um,
just with all my friends, you

138
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:03,120
know, I think it initially
started as a coping mechanism

139
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,380
just from my childhood. Uh, but I
was always like cracking up in

140
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,490
school. I remember one time, my
cousin and I were at a funeral or

141
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,860
something, we were like eight
years old at a funeral. And like,

142
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,560
we had to be separated. We were
laughing so hard, but we like

143
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,920
found each other through the
pews, you know, across the whole

144
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,071
church and we're still cracking
up, you know? And so, uh,

145
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:26,430
laughter has been a great
medicine for me, but it's got me

146
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,201
in trouble a lot. Um, but, uh,
but yeah, so it's just like such

147
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:34,951
a healing thing for me and I, and
I still have great friends. We

148
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:38,730
just instantly crack up with,
with our inside humor. Right? I

149
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,770
mean, no one else think it would,
no one else would think it was

150
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,801
funny, but, but yeah, so I I'm
like Bekah, I can't think of a

151
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:47,341
specific time, you know, another
specific time, but it's always

152
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:52,770
been a constant kind of thing for
me. And, and it, if I can laugh

153
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,221
with you, then I'm already feel
like halfway, like you're my best

154
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:58,831
friend, you know what I mean? and
then if we can talk about like

155
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:02,160
deep stuff, like real authentic
stuff, then we're like, we're

156
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,051
best mates. So, but. Yeah.

157
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,301
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

158
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,850
Bekah: That reminded me of a
time. I was at church with a

159
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,561
classmate and one of us, we were
like singing in church. Right.

160
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,181
And saying the wrong verse.
Right. And like very loudly. And

161
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:24,841
then there was like, no, no,
coming back, laughing so hard. We

162
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:27,990
were definitely crying. Somebody
had to get up and leave because

163
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,870
it was. Totally inappropriate and
disruptive, which like makes it

164
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,730
even funnier. I feel like.

165
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:36,931
Seth: Yeah. I mean, I hate to
even think about what my, I put

166
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:42,931
my teachers through in school. I
mean, I just was like, for me,

167
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:47,671
like if I had known comedy was
actually a, a, a career. Back in

168
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:51,900
then like nowadays people, people
like, oh, you got improv and all

169
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,880
these different YouTube things.
And like, people go, I wanna be a

170
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,941
comedian. They go and they pursue
that. But I never even knew it

171
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:59,551
was a career, but I listened to
comedy constant constantly

172
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:03,061
growing up. And then the thrill
of making people laugh, which was

173
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,811
what I did a ton of. It just
like, was like a huge like

174
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:09,571
thrill. I mean, it was great. And
I like couldn't get enough of it.

175
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:13,051
And to the point where I said it
was, it was. Disrespectful, you

176
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:16,951
know, now that I look back but
that's, that's part of being part

177
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:19,081
of growing up, I guess, being
young and immature and stuff.

178
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,686
Bekah: Always, I always, if there
were a personality trait that I

179
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:27,076
could just like download into my
brain, it would be making people

180
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:29,176
laugh. I don't know. That's not
really a personality trait, but

181
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:32,775
you go I always would love to
make people laugh. My grandma was

182
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,061
really great at it, and I always
wish that like, I had that same

183
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:39,990
ability because it kind of what
you're saying, set that idea of

184
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,921
you. If you can laugh together
with somebody, then you're

185
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:47,370
friends and then that does often
lead to that opportunity to dive

186
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,640
deeper into things, because
there's this almost like built in

187
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:54,480
trust that happens when you can
get into that deep laughter

188
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,051
together.

189
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,966
Seth: That's right. Totally.
That's a good question.

190
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:02,311
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. I now I'm
like, what is the neurobiology of

191
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:07,171
laughing together? Um, Uh, thanks
for being here with us today,

192
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:10,321
Seth. Uh, we are very excited to
have you on the podcast.

193
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,046
Seth: Thanks for having me.
This's awesome.

194
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:16,110
Bekah: yeah, we always like to
start with origin stories. So how

195
00:11:16,115 --> 00:11:21,030
have you got to this point in
your world of your, your journey

196
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:22,561
of Seth being Seth hall?

197
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,666
Seth: Yeah, sure. I'll, I'll give
you the, uh, I'll give you the

198
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:31,245
short version. um, yeah, so for
me, let's just, I'll just start

199
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:36,216
with kind. how I ended up in
development. Like when I was I'd

200
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:40,096
I always liked creative stuff
growing up. I was always, I grew

201
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,096
up in a single family home. I had
a lot of like time to myself and,

202
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:47,145
and music was a big escape for
me. So when I became an adult,

203
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:51,375
you know, I just say in my
twenties, I was like, I am gonna

204
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,691
do something different. I'm not
gonna do a typical path. You

205
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:58,530
take, or you're told that you're
supposed to take. So I, um,

206
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,321
graduated from college and then
went and pursued music. So I

207
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:06,331
played independent music for, you
know, for a long time. Um, I also

208
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:08,711
did video production and film
production during all that time.

209
00:12:09,571 --> 00:12:13,500
And then I continued, uh, you
know, did music for about pretty

210
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,280
hardcore for 15 years. Then I
just kind of transitioned into

211
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,370
the video film. And then I kind
of got into digital stuff, got my

212
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,831
first computer and was like, you
know, graphic design learning,

213
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:26,461
how to log into web apps and all
that kind of stuff back in 2006

214
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:30,841
and then 2011 in the middle of my
film and video pursuits, I

215
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:33,750
started making websites and it
wasn't really planned. It just

216
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,091
kind of happened. And so I
started teaching myself,

217
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:39,091
WordPress and all that, all.
Stuff, you know, that kind of

218
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:44,760
normal story. I got my first tech
job in 2013. Uh, during that job,

219
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,091
I, I decided I wanted to go get
my, uh, master's in film

220
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,150
producing. So I went to a film
school here in North Carolina

221
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:54,961
called, uh, university of North
Carolina school of the arts. Um,

222
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:59,941
and. That was a great experience.
I loved it. I took a break from

223
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:02,850
coding for a while to produce
videos for the school, actually

224
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,191
in their marketing department, I
made like three or four short

225
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:09,240
films. Um, but then I got to a
point where I was like, okay, I

226
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,181
don't really want to make videos
anymore. Cause I've done that so

227
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:15,811
much. Filmmaking doesn't pay. I
thought, well, maybe I'll do like

228
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:19,171
a. You know, go back into
development or maybe I'll maybe

229
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:21,841
do something developer adjacent.
So I like thought about being a

230
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:24,421
scrum master, you know, I was
like, I've worked in agile. And

231
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,941
so I kind of pursued that a
little bit. And then I realized,

232
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:30,150
you know, what? I really like
development. So, so two thou and

233
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,360
it just, you know, it's, it's.
Um, a lot of opportunities and it

234
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,890
pays well and it's fun and
challenging. So back in 2019

235
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:41,400
December, I jumped back in full
force and shortly after I joined

236
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,211
Virtual Coffee, you know, and,
and so for all of 2020 and all of

237
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:49,380
2021, I basically was doing front
end development, uh, multiple

238
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,640
contracts, some of 'em were
toxic. Um, some of 'em were.

239
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:57,676
Didn't value me. Like they
weren't great experiences. Um,

240
00:13:58,096 --> 00:14:01,155
but I just kept pursuing, kept
pursuing, kept pursuing. And then

241
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:07,306
I found a job at Uniform, uh, a
job posting at Uniform. I, it

242
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:10,005
sounded just like me. It was, it
was working in the jams stack as

243
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:15,015
a front end developer. It wasn't
a product. It was like demos. So

244
00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:19,066
like our internal team demos our
product with like fake websites

245
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,225
essentially. So I was like, oh,
that's great. I can make,

246
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:24,586
basically make client websites
without the client. You know, I

247
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:28,096
can make, uh, I can be a part of
a product team without being on

248
00:14:28,096 --> 00:14:31,816
the product team, you know? Um,
and so I got hired as a demo

249
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:35,025
engineer, um, and I've been
working for them for about four

250
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:39,586
months now, maybe five months,
but shortly after I got hired, it

251
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:44,041
was, it became evident that what
they really needed. Someone to

252
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,490
own the demos, like product own
the demos, not actually code the

253
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,821
demos. So I transitioned to a
technical product owner where I'm

254
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:55,971
working with, um, designers, uh,
uh, tech lead for developers,

255
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,270
marketers, sales, engineers, like
I'm working with a lot of people

256
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,211
to kind of guide all the demo
tracks and demo initiatives. We

257
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:07,306
have. But I'm, I'm like now I'm
planning, roadmaps. I'm I'm, I'm

258
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,696
basically producing. Like I, like
I did in film, like, cause with

259
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:14,265
film, I used to do camera sound,
editing, all the stuff. Then I

260
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:17,836
moved to producing where I was
like hiring those people and knew

261
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:20,265
what they were doing. And I was
planning the project. Well, now

262
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,905
it's, it's an interesting
equivalent is I, I used to be in

263
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:25,426
the trenches of front end as
y'all know, cause we've talked

264
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:29,311
many times about. But now I'm
like planning that stuff. So I'm,

265
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,971
I'm not the developer, but I'm a
developer adjacent. So my

266
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:36,451
initial, you know, thought back
in 2019 where maybe I could do

267
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:39,900
something developer adjacent has
like come to fruition, like on

268
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,681
accident and I am absolutely
loving it. So, so that's kind of

269
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:47,581
where, how I ended up here. You
know, to me, development is very

270
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:52,230
much aligns with my, um, my goals
in life. It's like, it's, it's

271
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,801
creative, it's challenging. It's
fun. It's flexible. It doesn't

272
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:59,581
rule my life. You know, I get to
go to work in my office and get

273
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:02,130
to leave and be with my family.
So like everything I wanted when

274
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:06,030
I was 20, when I pursued music
and film, I have found that I

275
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:13,081
have found autonomy, uh, good
pay, satisfactory work. And I'm

276
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:16,471
not like it's very unique too,
in, in a way, even though there's

277
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:18,571
a lot of developers, it's still a
unique way to make a living. Cuz

278
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:22,321
most people I talk to don't do
what I do. So it, it fit, checks

279
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:25,576
all the boxes for me. so, yeah,
that's, that's kind of my origin

280
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:29,655
story and, and, and a
professional origin story. Um,

281
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:33,946
and I'm very happy where I am.
I'm I haven't been happier in

282
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:36,916
the, in the, in the tech, in my
tech career than I am now. So

283
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:41,456
Bekah: Yeah, I love that. Um, I
wanna backtrack just a second.

284
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,971
And so you've done a lot of
different things. I love how you

285
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,610
say that this kind of like mimics
some of the things that you were

286
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:52,500
doing before with producing and
how those skills lead here, but

287
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:56,490
was there like a pivotal moment
for you when you decided that you

288
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:59,490
were ready to make this
transition? Because, you know, I

289
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,120
think it's sometimes hard to,
you're kind of toying with the

290
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,631
idea, or maybe you take on a
little bit of side work, but at

291
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:11,010
some point you have to say
there's a career transition. Now

292
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,540
I'm going to go all in.

293
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:17,701
Seth: Yeah. So from like film to
web was literally wasn't planned

294
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:22,066
at all. It was, it was, I sort of
just felt. Call on this draw to

295
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:25,185
do it. And all of a sudden I had
four clients, four WordPress

296
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:29,086
clients, and this is like, had no
experience. So I was doing all

297
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:31,365
the stuff you do to learn
WordPress. And of course that's

298
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:33,826
not the best platform to learn
on. Cause it's super confusing,

299
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,125
but I mean, but that's good. I
was in the trenches, so it was

300
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:39,586
never a conscious effort. It was
just something that I ended up

301
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:43,516
doing and I just did it cuz I
liked it and I worked nights and

302
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:46,846
weekends cause I liked it. And
then it started paying. Then I

303
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:50,266
got my first tech job, you know,
and, and so, but the transition

304
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:55,036
between, uh, uh, a front end
engineer to a product owner that

305
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:59,865
was very much a welcome
transition because as y'all have

306
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:04,996
seen or know, like front end
development, parts of it are

307
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:11,296
easy, quote, unquote easy, but a
lot of it is really difficult and

308
00:18:11,296 --> 00:18:15,736
I just found. was getting tired
of the grind. I was getting tired

309
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:20,086
of like not breaking through and
not, you know, not still not

310
00:18:20,086 --> 00:18:22,546
knowing stuff and still not
knowing how to learn stuff. I

311
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:25,185
don't know. And, and yeah, I
could, you know, put together a

312
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:29,086
JAMstack site. I could do some
product feature work and stuff,

313
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:33,766
but it just got to be exhausting.
And my skillsets are, are very

314
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:38,776
much relational. Communicate,
communicative, um, listening,

315
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:44,655
validating, planning, I mean, I'm
engineering. There's a, in my

316
00:18:44,655 --> 00:18:47,355
personal life, I'm like producing
the biggest thing I've ever done,

317
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:52,455
which might come up, but like my
mindset and my default is like to

318
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:56,296
dig in there and organize a big
thing. And that could be a movie

319
00:18:56,445 --> 00:19:00,675
that could be now it's a three
different demo tracks, you know,

320
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:04,276
and in my life, it's a, you know,
other personal stuff that I'm

321
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:08,671
producing Essent. And so, so
yeah, so it was the initial

322
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,550
thing. Wasn't a conscious effort.
It really was outta nowhere. And

323
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,800
I was kinda like, what? Like,
this doesn't make any sense. I'm

324
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,590
trying to pursue film. What, what
do you mean what's going on here?

325
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:20,191
But it, it quickly became
something like, okay, this is

326
00:19:20,195 --> 00:19:22,171
really good for me. Um, yeah,

327
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:26,355
Dan: So you used the word
producing a few times there, and

328
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,566
that's a word that you don't
usually hear in the development,

329
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:32,415
like side of things. Right. But
you hear it a lot in

330
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:35,596
entertainment. Uh, and, uh, so I
was just wondering if, if your

331
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:39,601
experience with, uh, In film
school and stuff like that. Um,

332
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,471
you know, the producer of I'm not
in entertainment, I listen to

333
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:46,351
some podcasts and stuff, you
know, but like, if, if there's,

334
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:51,181
if there's some bit of that you
took away, uh, from the, from

335
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:54,391
film school to guide your work
now as a, as a sort

336
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:57,810
Seth: hundred percent. Totally,
totally. You know, in software,

337
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,540
we'd call it project management,
I guess, you know,

338
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:03,270
Dan: Yeah, right. But that's not.
Yeah, that's the, I don't feel

339
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,510
like that covers every to me,
the, the word producer has, has

340
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,701
a, a bit of a different connot
it's close, you know, there's

341
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:10,891
overlap, but like a bit of a
different connotation. I think

342
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:13,770
it's a good word, uh, to use, but
I'd like to hear what you like,

343
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:15,580
Seth: yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so I
got.

344
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:15,691
Dan: of that.

345
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:19,066
Seth: Yeah, that's a good
question. Uh, I got my master's

346
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:22,155
in creative producing, which so
in film, there's a lot of

347
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,526
different producers. There's like
your boots on the ground

348
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:27,826
producer. There's, there's
associate producers, there's

349
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:31,546
executive producers who like fund
it or make a connection and they

350
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:34,246
get a credit. But then the
creative producer is the one that

351
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:39,016
like comes up with the idea or
like options of script Bekah you

352
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:41,986
know about this. And then they,
they hire the writer. They, they,

353
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:45,135
they develop the script and then
they take the script into.

354
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,871
Raising money or, or making a
pitch deck to raise money. And

355
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:51,391
then they take that money and
they go into pre-production and

356
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:54,270
then they keep going through
production and post and marketing

357
00:20:54,276 --> 00:20:57,661
and distribution. So creative
producer is like the unsung hero

358
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,951
essentially, um, in film, because
most film, it falls on the

359
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:04,921
director or the star of the
movie. It, but the producer

360
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:07,471
doesn't get much credit, but
without the producer, it wouldn't

361
00:21:07,471 --> 00:21:12,961
even exist. And so all through
that process, really that process

362
00:21:12,961 --> 00:21:16,875
is all about. It's all about
like, you know, for example, like

363
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:22,336
what are we trying to say? Like,
you know, and in a who's who's

364
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,086
our audience, right? Both of
those things can translate to, to

365
00:21:26,145 --> 00:21:29,596
a product in, in software. And
then like, who are the people I'm

366
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,596
working with? How do I
communicate with them that

367
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:36,885
translates to software. And then,
then the nuts and bolts of it all

368
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:40,695
which is let's let's let's plan
the project and actually do the

369
00:21:40,695 --> 00:21:45,750
work, same thing in software. And
so. It, it, I just, it just seems

370
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,411
like a perfect thing for me
because it's like already what I

371
00:21:49,411 --> 00:21:52,411
was good at. And I've already got
all the experience in it and it,

372
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,280
100% is transferable over to
software. It's just different,

373
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,671
um, different, medium and
different ways to do it. Like you

374
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:03,540
don't have. Editors and, you
know, and software, but you have

375
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,300
QA, you know, quality and
assurance or whatever. You don't

376
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,280
have sound audio mixers, but you
have, you know, front end

377
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,391
developers or back end or
security or whatever. So, so I

378
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:19,171
learned a ton going to school.
Like I learned, I, I took what I

379
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,830
had already learned in life and
then like just applied it to, uh,

380
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:27,211
intimate collaboration and then
like different personalities and

381
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:30,766
different cultures and different
ages. And. Genders and everything

382
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,046
like cuz when I went to art
school, I was like 20 years older

383
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:35,655
than most people. And there was a
ton of people that were just

384
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:40,875
different than me, but I really
just got to respect them and see

385
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,945
what they were about and learn
how to be with them and learn how

386
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:47,655
to deal with conflict and, and,
and learn how to persevere on a

387
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:51,405
giant project that seems never
ending. And that is software

388
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:55,336
development in many ways. So
that's kind of what I transferred

389
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:58,560
over and it feels. It's just same
skill set. Just different

390
00:22:58,711 --> 00:22:59,881
application, essentially.

391
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:03,855
Dan: I love that. I love that a
lot. And you hit one of our, uh,

392
00:23:03,976 --> 00:23:06,976
Virtual Coffee, bingo words,
which is intimate. And I think

393
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:09,796
you used the phrase intimate
collaboration, which I love. And,

394
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:13,635
um, and it's, it paints such a
different picture that from that

395
00:23:13,635 --> 00:23:16,665
mindset, uh, paints such a
different picture than. Some of

396
00:23:16,665 --> 00:23:19,125
the software, like when you come
at it from the software land,

397
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:24,556
everybody software developers,
lots of times, uh, want to remove

398
00:23:24,826 --> 00:23:28,425
the human aspects of things.
Right. And they build tools to

399
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:32,145
like plug things in or project
management tools or, you know,

400
00:23:32,151 --> 00:23:35,236
everybody has stacks of cards to,
oh, sorry. Everyone has stacks of

401
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:39,796
cards to get through. And, uh, I
know he's always bothering me.

402
00:23:41,205 --> 00:23:41,685
uh,

403
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:42,570
Seth: is he like bringing you a

404
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,346
Dan: special guests. Yeah, I
know. He's yeah. Yeah. He's he's

405
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,286
he brings me my, my, uh, my
scotch at the, you know, under my

406
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:51,316
desk at the end of the day,
except it's the middle of the

407
00:23:51,316 --> 00:23:55,605
day. Anyway. uh, what was I
saying? So, um, yes, I think

408
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:58,516
that, I think that's probably
another connection between you,

409
00:23:58,546 --> 00:24:04,546
the, um, your experience within
the entertainment, you know, in

410
00:24:04,546 --> 00:24:09,675
film, in the film realm is, is.
Making these connections is such

411
00:24:09,675 --> 00:24:11,865
an important thing. And it's,
it's very important in software

412
00:24:11,865 --> 00:24:14,746
too, but I, I think it gets,
people tend to abstract it away.

413
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,715
Uh, people tend to abstract away
the human connection aspect of

414
00:24:17,776 --> 00:24:22,155
anything. And, um, I feel like
work, everybody, all we're all

415
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:26,415
doing. And, uh, everybody sort of
naturally does a Virtual Coffee,

416
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:30,766
whether they are officially doing
it or not. Um, and I'm seeing

417
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:33,465
other people start to swing this
way too, is, uh, lots of people

418
00:24:33,465 --> 00:24:37,141
talk about community these days.
Building communities in your

419
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:40,381
company and, and things like
making connections like that. And

420
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:43,800
I think we're finding out, like,
it's, it's so important to, uh,

421
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:46,590
foster those sort of intimate
connections. And obviously you

422
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:51,181
can go probably too far but like
remembering that all the people

423
00:24:51,181 --> 00:24:53,971
are people, right. And everybody
that works on a project is, has

424
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:56,490
their own stake in it. And you
know, it it's, the project's

425
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,010
gonna be better if you have
somebody like that, have somebody

426
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,971
like you, you know, um, fostering
these intimate, you know,

427
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,661
connections and

428
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,510
Seth: Yeah. I mean, that's
exactly right. I mean, and part

429
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:10,381
of that is like, you know, we. Is
giving shouts out to people,

430
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,651
shoutouts to people, whatever you
wanna say, like acknowledging

431
00:25:13,651 --> 00:25:17,111
people and, and, and celebrating
them. Now you had mentioned

432
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:23,711
community and how it's kind of
becoming. Prevalent in software

433
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:26,560
and I'm, to me, that's great. Cuz
that's what it is. That's what

434
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,451
it's about for me, just in many
ways is, is friendship and

435
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:39,941
authenticity and you know,
intimate, know, friendships that

436
00:25:39,945 --> 00:25:44,441
are real, that, that like bring
the joy to life and bring, bring,

437
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,840
you know, bring things to life.
That's what it is for me. And,

438
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:51,056
and so part of that is. You know,
at work, I like to do shout outs

439
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,806
to people and like really just
celebrate people and, and, you

440
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:57,895
know, I'm, I'm a super positive,
you know, I don't wanna have any

441
00:25:57,901 --> 00:26:01,645
conflict if there is conflict,
I'll deal with it. But like, and

442
00:26:01,651 --> 00:26:04,645
I've had so many jobs where it's
just like, not like that at all.

443
00:26:04,645 --> 00:26:08,455
And it's so makes me so anxious
and nervous, and I, I don't know

444
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:12,385
how to find my footing and, and
like, I just feel like

445
00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:17,336
undervalued and, and. Not in the
right place. And so at Uniform,

446
00:26:17,336 --> 00:26:20,425
like it's the exact opposite.
Like everybody is super friendly,

447
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:26,096
super laid back. Um, just very
welcoming and, and community it's

448
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:31,375
like culturally at Uniform is the
culture at Uniform is very, uh,

449
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:35,846
like on point. It's great and it
fits my personality and I feel

450
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:39,026
and say from that I feel valued
and I feel empowered to do really

451
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:42,520
good. I mean, that's how it
works. You appreciate people and

452
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,730
you're, you're, you're a nice
pleasant people to be around.

453
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,550
You're gonna wanna work hard and
collaborate together to do things

454
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:51,250
as opposed to feeling like you
can't, you're walking on thin ice

455
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:51,830
or whatever you.

456
00:26:52,705 --> 00:26:55,556
Bekah: I, I love that. And I
think that one of the things that

457
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,066
you, one of the words you used,
uh, authenticity is so important

458
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:01,586
because I think that there are a
number of companies out there

459
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:07,135
that recognize that community
within the company is good and

460
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:10,675
can be really useful, but they
come at it from a, not an

461
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:15,276
authentic approach. We're gonna
make this company a community.

462
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:18,846
Right. And then there's this
forcefulness, like, we're gonna

463
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:22,145
be a community. Now you have to
go to this fun thing that we're

464
00:27:22,145 --> 00:27:27,066
all doing together, right? Like,
no, I don't wanna do that fun

465
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:33,701
thing all together. Um, there,
there has to be. That

466
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:38,171
authenticity there that allows
for vulnerability and openness.

467
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:42,191
And, you know, I've also seen a
number of leaders in positions

468
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:48,280
that kind of, um, I don't know
the right word for this. They

469
00:27:48,286 --> 00:27:55,451
perform authenticity. So they act
in a way that appears to be

470
00:27:55,451 --> 00:27:57,881
authentic, but like the further.

471
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,006
Seth: not authentic. Yeah.

472
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:02,125
Bekah: Yeah. And the further you
get into it, then it, it just

473
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:06,145
like, then, then the like
suspicious radar goes up. Like,

474
00:28:06,236 --> 00:28:10,645
uh, I don't know that you are a
person that I can really trust

475
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:14,215
and talk to. And then that
creates more of a divide. And

476
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:16,945
when you have that, when you
don't have somebody who's

477
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,185
authentic or vulnerable, or, you
know, even getting back to that,

478
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:24,586
like intro question of somebody
that you can laugh. Then you,

479
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:28,096
there's this distance, there's
this guard that you can put up or

480
00:28:28,096 --> 00:28:33,375
that you might put up that makes
it harder for you to be effective

481
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:37,155
at your job, or to communicate
with other people, because

482
00:28:37,155 --> 00:28:42,885
there's always this like, um,
Lees about where you stand in

483
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:48,685
that, you know, Relationship or
in that, um, collaboration or, or

484
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,655
whatever it is. So I think that,
you know, having someone

485
00:28:51,655 --> 00:28:58,105
authentic, leading a team is so
important in forming those bonds

486
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,905
that you need for your company.

487
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,580
Seth: Totally. We just
implemented this thing called,

488
00:29:03,586 --> 00:29:08,441
uh, 15 five. It's a online web
service that allows for like, it

489
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:13,151
manages one on ones. It manages,
um, like high fives you can give,

490
00:29:13,181 --> 00:29:17,681
you know, you know, internal high
fives and it, and it really, um,

491
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:21,520
opens it, fosters that kind of
community and that kind of

492
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,605
culture. And so that's why my, my
company is. Series a funded

493
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:30,115
startups. They're just beginning
to like hire and work on culture

494
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:32,816
and work on all that stuff that
they, in the beginning, you don't

495
00:29:32,816 --> 00:29:35,155
do that cuz you're building a
product to get the funding. But

496
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:37,885
now that they have the funding,
all these things are lock into

497
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:41,336
place and it is just such a
relief to, to know that that's

498
00:29:41,336 --> 00:29:44,546
there and it like to not walk
into, to walk into work and not

499
00:29:44,546 --> 00:29:51,573
be anxious and not be nervous.
You know? I'm not dreading like

500
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:55,022
how am I gonna make this
JavaScript thing happen?

501
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:56,357
Bekah: Oh,

502
00:29:56,553 --> 00:29:57,992
Seth: you know what I mean? Like,
how am I gonna do this? Like I

503
00:29:57,992 --> 00:30:00,212
should, and then start beating
myself up. I should know this

504
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:04,053
already. I've been doing this for
this long and, and anyway, and.

505
00:30:04,712 --> 00:30:07,593
That's just to kind of highlight
the importance of, of community.

506
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:10,383
And I will say that, you know,
when I discovered Virtual Coffee,

507
00:30:10,383 --> 00:30:14,103
I don't even remember how I
discovered it. I think it was

508
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,073
through Drew Clemons somehow. I
remember.

509
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:17,988
Bekah: that's true.

510
00:30:18,272 --> 00:30:22,323
Seth: I forget, I somehow found
him and then found Virtual Coffee

511
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:24,153
and it was like a huge breath of
fresh

512
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:26,807
Bekah: He was doing Protege. So
was it through Protege,

513
00:30:26,853 --> 00:30:28,173
Seth: Yeah, it was probably
through that. I was probably

514
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:32,373
looking for jobs and I saw him
through Protege and then I saw

515
00:30:32,377 --> 00:30:34,728
Virtual Coffee through him. And
then I ended up working on

516
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:39,018
Protege through that too, which
was interesting, but, um, it was

517
00:30:39,018 --> 00:30:45,048
such a, when I discovered Virtual
Coffee, it was a godsend,

518
00:30:45,528 --> 00:30:48,317
essentially, cuz we were in the
middle of pan. I was in the

519
00:30:48,317 --> 00:30:49,817
middle of the pandemic. Right. We
were all in the middle of the

520
00:30:49,817 --> 00:30:53,688
pandemic. I had moved out to the
mountains, which I like my, I

521
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:56,627
like being out in the mountains,
but I also like people, you know,

522
00:30:57,077 --> 00:31:01,758
um, and I just, it was, it saved,
it saved me in many ways, cuz it

523
00:31:01,758 --> 00:31:04,307
helped me keep going as a
developer and it helped me

524
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:08,087
develop friendships and, and
it's, you know, and that's,

525
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:10,097
that's it that's community.
Right? That's what community does

526
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:16,667
it, it, it kind of, it gives, um,
it, it, it, uh, a lot of things

527
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:20,417
start to bloom, right? All the
different, these beautiful things

528
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:23,508
start blooming from it and we can
see it every day on, on our, on

529
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:27,633
our slack team is. People are
doing this and doing that. And

530
00:31:27,633 --> 00:31:29,373
there's support here. There's
support there. And then you got

531
00:31:29,373 --> 00:31:32,673
in person meetups and it just,
and that's just a beautiful thing

532
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:35,492
about the Virtual Coffee, I
think. And I'm sure you never

533
00:31:35,492 --> 00:31:38,012
even expected that when you
started it, you know, you might

534
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:41,732
have thought something like, like
it, but yeah, it just, it just,

535
00:31:41,792 --> 00:31:44,883
all of us coming together to
support each other really makes

536
00:31:44,913 --> 00:31:47,343
the, makes industry makes our
lives better, but it makes the

537
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:48,482
industry better. I think.

538
00:31:50,252 --> 00:31:53,792
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. I, I
think that any opportunity that

539
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:56,732
you have for that close
collaboration with people,

540
00:31:57,182 --> 00:32:02,702
openness with other people can
be. Just a, I don't know. I mean,

541
00:32:02,702 --> 00:32:05,163
yeah, you can be more productive
that way, but that's just a

542
00:32:05,163 --> 00:32:08,373
really beautiful part of the
human experience. And I think

543
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:13,893
that we often don't think about
that, that we it's complicated,

544
00:32:13,893 --> 00:32:16,952
right. Because we want our jobs
stop. We don't want them to go on

545
00:32:16,952 --> 00:32:21,153
all the time and to feel like we
can never leave our computers,

546
00:32:21,153 --> 00:32:25,863
but there's something to be said
for finding time to pause and

547
00:32:25,867 --> 00:32:31,593
make meaningful. Relationships
with the people who are on your

548
00:32:31,593 --> 00:32:36,573
team. Um, That helps you to be
better, everybody to be better at

549
00:32:36,573 --> 00:32:39,603
their jobs. But, you know,
ultimately we are not our jobs.

550
00:32:39,603 --> 00:32:43,923
We are human beings. And so what
helps us to become better at

551
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:48,992
that, or to grow or to become the
people that we want to be our

552
00:32:48,992 --> 00:32:52,292
jobs take up a big portion of our
lives. So finding something that

553
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:56,103
allows you to continue on that
path of being the person that you

554
00:32:56,103 --> 00:32:58,893
want to be, and to be able to do
the things that you wanna do

555
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,442
outside of work is really
important.

556
00:33:02,538 --> 00:33:05,208
Seth: Yeah. Yep. A hundred
percent. That was that's

557
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:09,347
basically what my 20 year old
self was saying to myself. is

558
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:12,827
just like, there's gotta be more
like, I, I need something

559
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:17,778
meaningful. I need something.
That's just not like just a

560
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:21,948
typical middle of the road, you
know? And, and I'm not saying

561
00:33:21,948 --> 00:33:26,147
this for everybody, but it's
pursuing, I've always pursued my

562
00:33:26,147 --> 00:33:29,298
dreams and my heart and, and, and
for good, you know, for better or

563
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:33,978
for worse. And, but it's got me
this far, right. It's gotten me

564
00:33:35,478 --> 00:33:39,678
in a career that I love being
with my family every day. Well

565
00:33:39,678 --> 00:33:44,702
paid well respected and creative.
and like you said, it's not my

566
00:33:45,002 --> 00:33:51,363
life, my life is outside of work,
um, in many ways. So, you know,

567
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,593
yeah. I feel like I won the
lottery essentially in some ways,

568
00:33:56,012 --> 00:34:02,163
but I got, but I spent a lot of
money on lottery tickets and went

569
00:34:02,163 --> 00:34:04,303
through a lot to get here. Um,
but.

570
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:08,237
Bekah: And it's all part of the
journey, right? I mean, I, I

571
00:34:08,237 --> 00:34:12,108
certainly never if five and a
half years ago, if you would've

572
00:34:12,347 --> 00:34:16,097
asked me where I expected to be,
it certainly was not here. Um,

573
00:34:16,728 --> 00:34:20,027
there, there was a lot that went
into this journey and a lot of

574
00:34:20,027 --> 00:34:23,297
like, really hard things to
navigate, but, you know, I

575
00:34:23,297 --> 00:34:27,228
wouldn't take any of those hard
things back because it shaped me

576
00:34:27,228 --> 00:34:32,222
into the person I am and I'm, I'm
happy. With who I am right now,

577
00:34:32,222 --> 00:34:34,563
probably more than I ever have
been in my life. And,

578
00:34:35,177 --> 00:34:35,418
Seth: Yep.

579
00:34:35,822 --> 00:34:38,163
Bekah: you know, all of those
circumstances and all of the

580
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:42,422
people that I've met, especially
in the last three years have been

581
00:34:42,427 --> 00:34:45,422
on that journey with me and
allowed me to, you know, kind of

582
00:34:45,572 --> 00:34:49,414
embrace this, this Bekah that I
am right now. Um, so,

583
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:51,478
Seth: Yeah. That's a good place
to be.

584
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:56,123
Bekah: okay. So as you're going
through this, you have mentioned

585
00:34:56,123 --> 00:35:01,643
a couple of times, The, you had
some experiences with other

586
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:04,943
companies that weren't so great.
You went through some difficult

587
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:08,152
interviewing experiences and now
you're, you're at this really

588
00:35:08,152 --> 00:35:12,862
great place, but I wonder if you
could give yourself some advice

589
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:16,163
looking back now. So when you
were going through these hard

590
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:21,023
experiences, what would you tell
yourself to kind of give you that

591
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:23,483
hope that you needed to make it
to this point?

592
00:35:24,983 --> 00:35:27,983
Seth: Yeah, I would just say, I
mean, off the top of my head that

593
00:35:27,983 --> 00:35:34,882
like, um, rejection's part of the
process and perseverance is key

594
00:35:36,262 --> 00:35:42,862
and just, it's really hard to do
this, but most of the time things

595
00:35:42,862 --> 00:35:47,992
aren't personal, right. It's
just. In terms of interviewing,

596
00:35:48,052 --> 00:35:50,213
it's just, you want a good fit or
you bomb the interview or

597
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:53,753
whatever, but to like separate
your identity from that and

598
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:58,222
separate your, um, how you feel
about yourself and stuff. It's

599
00:35:58,228 --> 00:36:00,563
really hard when you need money,
you need a job and you have a

600
00:36:00,563 --> 00:36:03,742
family and stuff you're super
stressed about it. And, and then

601
00:36:03,748 --> 00:36:07,733
you gotta go do more interviews
and stuff. But, um, but yeah,

602
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:11,603
like don't be hard on yourself.
Like don't just trust. I mean,

603
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:16,913
this is a big part of my life. Is
is trust the process, right?

604
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:21,233
Whether that be any films that I
produce or all that day in and

605
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:24,893
day out of what I'm doing for my
work, or even my family, it's

606
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:28,612
just like, just do the work
that's ahead of you for the day,

607
00:36:29,092 --> 00:36:32,572
clock out, enjoy your life, go
back the next day and do the work

608
00:36:32,572 --> 00:36:34,913
that's ahead of you. And just
trust that that's the process and

609
00:36:34,913 --> 00:36:40,253
you will eventually get
somewhere. Um, and then I also am

610
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:44,632
a big. Or I'm a big advocate in
advocating for myself, but, uh,

611
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:53,152
I'm a big, um, believer in like
standing up for yourself,

612
00:36:53,362 --> 00:36:57,742
believing in yourself, knowing
what you want, like going to get

613
00:36:57,742 --> 00:37:02,213
it. Um, and that's not in like a
greed, like, uh, you know, way.

614
00:37:02,213 --> 00:37:04,523
It's just like, I want to do
this. I'm gonna work really hard

615
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:09,427
to do this thing, whatever that
is. And, um, So like believing

616
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:15,637
yourself, you know, extending
grace to yourself, um, a hundred

617
00:37:15,637 --> 00:37:19,418
percent fine people find your
people who can help you AKA

618
00:37:19,418 --> 00:37:25,447
Virtual Coffee. um, so yeah, I
think, I think off the top of my

619
00:37:25,447 --> 00:37:29,438
head, those would be some things
I would say to myself. Um, I

620
00:37:29,438 --> 00:37:34,237
would also be. When you have a
community, you can talk, you can

621
00:37:34,237 --> 00:37:37,628
run red flags by people. You can
say, Hey, is this a red flag? Or,

622
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:40,418
you know, and if, if someone's
mistreating, you stand up for

623
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:43,777
yourself. I know that's not, I
know that's easy for me to say

624
00:37:44,197 --> 00:37:49,927
for who I am, but not everybody
can do that, but, and I'm just

625
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:54,697
happened to be comfortable with
discomfort, I guess you could

626
00:37:54,697 --> 00:38:01,538
say. So like, if, if someone's
treating me bad, I'm. Um, stand

627
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:06,068
up for myself and try not to be a
jerk about it. Try not to be

628
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:10,117
combative, but, um, just believe
in myself and, and know what's

629
00:38:10,117 --> 00:38:13,717
right. And what's wrong in a
situation. Um, but I mean, you

630
00:38:13,722 --> 00:38:18,878
guys know it's so hard to when
you're navigating interviews. It

631
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:22,987
it's like soul sucking. It's it's
it sucks.

632
00:38:24,577 --> 00:38:27,577
Bekah: Yeah, I remember. Um, I
think it was last summer.

633
00:38:27,577 --> 00:38:30,458
Actually at this time I was
interviewing with two companies

634
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:35,108
and I had heard people say that
the interview process was soul

635
00:38:35,108 --> 00:38:37,748
crushing. And I was like, eh,
there's no way it's soul

636
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:40,688
crushing. And then I was invited
to apply to two of these

637
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:45,873
positions and it was. Still so
crushing. I'm like, is the worst.

638
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:50,882
I never want to do this ever
again. And it is, I mean, it just

639
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:56,552
requires so much out of you in,
in a number of different ways.

640
00:38:56,552 --> 00:39:01,592
And kind of is, um, I don't know,
puts you through this furnace and

641
00:39:01,802 --> 00:39:05,313
how you come out of that. It can
be, you know, you, you might be.

642
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:11,932
Burnt or, you know, maybe you
come out a diamond. I felt like

643
00:39:11,938 --> 00:39:13,193
that was really cheesy.

644
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,047
Dan: Yeah, that wouldn't, that
was a little rough

645
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:29,603
Bekah: I don't know. Sorry. Sorry
for the bad metaphor. Um, but

646
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:31,822
the, but the point is kind of
like what you were saying, set

647
00:39:31,822 --> 00:39:36,592
this idea of don't take it
personally, um, and think about

648
00:39:36,592 --> 00:39:41,333
it too, as part of that Right.
Um, I like to think of the hero's

649
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:45,413
journey and we're all the hero in
our own story and, and what the

650
00:39:45,443 --> 00:39:49,402
hero Right? And the hero in, in
the mythological structure of the

651
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:52,972
hero, first of all, there are
many, many challenges that the

652
00:39:52,972 --> 00:39:56,273
hero has to navigate and that
defines the trajectory of the

653
00:39:56,273 --> 00:40:00,157
journey, but also the hero never
does. It by themselves. There's

654
00:40:00,157 --> 00:40:04,748
always some type of mentor. There
are allies that they have. There

655
00:40:04,748 --> 00:40:09,967
are, um, resources or training or
different things that enable them

656
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:15,023
to continue to move forward. And
in that way, you know, we can

657
00:40:15,023 --> 00:40:18,563
continue to push forward, but
recognizing that we're not on

658
00:40:18,563 --> 00:40:22,012
this journey alone, there are
other people that are there with

659
00:40:22,012 --> 00:40:26,512
us to support us through those
tough times. And when things do

660
00:40:26,512 --> 00:40:31,362
get tough, then, then rather
than. You know, pull away or try

661
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:34,932
and do it on your own, leaning on
some of those people or finding

662
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:38,893
your allies or mentors or
whatever can be the difference

663
00:40:38,893 --> 00:40:43,273
between being stuck in your
journey and continuing forward.

664
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:47,572
Seth: Hmm. Yeah, that's a great
point. Awesome.

665
00:40:49,222 --> 00:40:53,543
Bekah: So, um, your job, you are
the technical product owner, and

666
00:40:53,543 --> 00:40:57,362
I'm just kind of circling back a
little bit because I have never

667
00:40:57,713 --> 00:41:03,532
heard of anyone being a technical
product owner before. So just to

668
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:07,643
kind of get a better sense of
what you're doing. Can you talk

669
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:11,932
us through like maybe one of the
projects that you're working on

670
00:41:11,932 --> 00:41:15,443
or the things that you do find
really interesting about that?

671
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:21,302
Seth: Sure. Yeah, I think it's,
uh, it could be even considered a

672
00:41:21,572 --> 00:41:25,773
product manager, right? Not a
project manager, but a product

673
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:31,233
manager. So it's, it's an agile
term, um, product owner. And it

674
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:37,088
is basically, I mean, again, it's
the creative producer of, um, Of

675
00:41:37,088 --> 00:41:41,347
software or whatever, cuz it's,
it's communicating with all the

676
00:41:41,347 --> 00:41:44,498
stakeholders, figuring out what
you need, figuring out the

677
00:41:44,498 --> 00:41:49,057
direction of the product. Um,
what's the roadmap, what are the

678
00:41:49,057 --> 00:41:54,757
priorities? Um, you know,
breaking all that, all that down

679
00:41:54,757 --> 00:42:00,398
into tickets, communicating all
that. Communicating all those

680
00:42:00,398 --> 00:42:03,728
needs to developers, right?
That's a special transition there

681
00:42:04,387 --> 00:42:08,858
and also working with multiple
stakeholders. So, so it's very,

682
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:12,427
it's, it's a, it's an agile term.
It could also be pro product

683
00:42:12,427 --> 00:42:16,717
manager, I guess, maybe PM or
whatever. But the technical side

684
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:21,697
of it is because I was a front
end developer and I was

685
00:42:21,697 --> 00:42:24,367
originally hired to be a front
end developer in the trenches

686
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:29,302
building out JAMstack sites. And
when this transition came, I was

687
00:42:29,302 --> 00:42:32,152
like, okay, I can see that. I was
like, but I still like have all

688
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:35,922
this technical knowledge. And my
CTO's the one that said it, it

689
00:42:35,922 --> 00:42:37,643
was like, we look at you more
like a technical product owner. I

690
00:42:37,648 --> 00:42:40,643
was like, great. Let's do it. You
know? And what that means is I

691
00:42:40,648 --> 00:42:44,123
just understand what's happening
on the development side. I

692
00:42:44,123 --> 00:42:48,202
understand what it takes to do a
feature or understand what's

693
00:42:48,202 --> 00:42:51,322
happening. I'm just not the one
doing it. And if, and I, but I'm

694
00:42:51,322 --> 00:42:54,952
still like spinning up, you know,
I'm still doing front end stuff

695
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:58,342
where I'm like, you know, I'm
doing all the repo stuff and

696
00:42:58,347 --> 00:43:00,592
doing the readme and going
through all the steps of the

697
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:03,023
readme and installing MPN
packages and all that kind of

698
00:43:03,023 --> 00:43:08,092
stuff. So I'm still in the
technical area. I'm just not a

699
00:43:08,092 --> 00:43:13,193
front end developer, like I used
to be. Um, and you know, what I

700
00:43:13,193 --> 00:43:16,987
love about it is the different
communi the D. Groups. I work

701
00:43:16,987 --> 00:43:20,737
with, like, I get to hang out
with designers and talk about UX

702
00:43:20,737 --> 00:43:26,318
and UI. I get to review designs.
I get to offer tweaks and you

703
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:29,047
know, and I get to think of it as
a developer, cuz I know, oh, this

704
00:43:29,047 --> 00:43:32,648
image is huge. We, you know how
let's figure out what image size

705
00:43:32,648 --> 00:43:35,603
we need or whatever that comes
up. From the developer mindset

706
00:43:35,603 --> 00:43:38,273
when talking to designers and
then I get to talk to like

707
00:43:38,273 --> 00:43:41,932
marketers and that that's a
little bit out outside of my

708
00:43:41,963 --> 00:43:45,143
comfort zone, but I'm a people
person, so I can talk to them and

709
00:43:45,503 --> 00:43:48,922
ask what they need and what you
know, like what, what do you,

710
00:43:49,012 --> 00:43:52,043
what do you need to demo? Like,
what are you trying to what, like

711
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:54,713
the first thing I did when I got
to this job was I talked to,

712
00:43:54,713 --> 00:43:59,077
like, I had like 20 meetings or
something and. No time at all.

713
00:43:59,077 --> 00:44:01,208
And I was talking to everybody
about what are the pain points

714
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:04,088
of, of the current demo, the
current demo ecosystem, like

715
00:44:04,447 --> 00:44:08,257
you're taking this product
Uniforms platform and you're

716
00:44:08,257 --> 00:44:11,768
demoing it to people. What, what
are you missing? Like what are

717
00:44:11,773 --> 00:44:15,398
they asking for? What do you
wanna see? And, and what it ended

718
00:44:15,398 --> 00:44:17,378
up being was like, well, we got
like three or four different

719
00:44:17,378 --> 00:44:20,648
demos that are all doing random
things, and we need all those

720
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:24,338
features and functionalities in,
into, uh, consolidated

721
00:44:25,057 --> 00:44:31,777
redesigned. Redeveloped demos,
you know, so, so I get to, and,

722
00:44:31,782 --> 00:44:35,137
and I, I really do look at it as
like basically making client gems

723
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:39,097
stack sites. My, my client just
happens to be my, my coworkers.

724
00:44:39,532 --> 00:44:42,833
Right. So they're asking me for
stuff and I'm saying, well, I, I

725
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:46,103
can, or can't do that, this
sprint or, okay, cool. I'll work

726
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:48,952
that in. And then I'm going over
to, um, tech lead and saying,

727
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:51,742
Hey, we need to do this. And he
goes, okay, cool. Well, I'll,

728
00:44:51,802 --> 00:44:55,373
I'll work up the techs of the
tech side of that. And we'll,

729
00:44:55,373 --> 00:44:57,682
we'll pass the issues down to the
developers and then developers

730
00:44:57,682 --> 00:45:00,802
deliver it to me. And I do user
assurance testing where I'm like,

731
00:45:00,802 --> 00:45:03,777
okay, that's what I wanted.
That's what. What we need and, or

732
00:45:03,777 --> 00:45:07,407
I'll say, Hey, this responsive,
you know, layout is wrong or,

733
00:45:07,648 --> 00:45:10,858
Hey, you know, we need to do this
different. And so I like the

734
00:45:10,862 --> 00:45:14,097
idea, or I like the, my, my job
in the sense that I get to talk

735
00:45:14,097 --> 00:45:16,557
to all these different people.
Right? When I was a front end

736
00:45:16,557 --> 00:45:19,887
developer, it was me by myself,
banging my head against the wall,

737
00:45:20,097 --> 00:45:24,117
reading tutorials and, you know,
then I would, then I would ping

738
00:45:24,117 --> 00:45:27,027
Virtual Coffee people and have,
you know, different co-working

739
00:45:27,027 --> 00:45:30,728
sessions and stuff. But most of
the time it was me by myself. And

740
00:45:30,757 --> 00:45:37,297
so I love that part of it. Um, I
love that. I get to understand

741
00:45:37,327 --> 00:45:40,478
these big features and understand
how to make them happen, but I

742
00:45:40,478 --> 00:45:45,608
don't have to be the one coding
it. I really like that. Um, and

743
00:45:45,612 --> 00:45:48,907
that's just because it was, like
I said before, it was, it could

744
00:45:48,907 --> 00:45:53,467
be super difficult to solve these
technical problems. And I like

745
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:58,057
being the one who's guiding it,
encouraging, getting people

746
00:45:58,057 --> 00:46:03,623
stoked. Updating our progress,
you know, um, knowing what they

747
00:46:03,623 --> 00:46:06,413
accomplished, like, man, you guys
did a really hard feature, good

748
00:46:06,413 --> 00:46:10,253
job, you know, and, and, and the
way I communicate my tickets to

749
00:46:10,253 --> 00:46:13,132
them, my get up issues to them,
they know that I know that stuff,

750
00:46:13,822 --> 00:46:15,802
you know what I mean? Cause I'm
able to be like, Hey, can you,

751
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:18,983
can you change? Just tell when
class to so and so and so of, so

752
00:46:18,983 --> 00:46:21,742
and so because of whatever, you
know, so it's like I'm getting

753
00:46:21,742 --> 00:46:26,693
to, to be developer adjacent. And
so, so a product owner really

754
00:46:26,697 --> 00:46:32,213
just sees the product from. It,
it takes everything in, it plans

755
00:46:32,213 --> 00:46:35,902
the whole thing out, and then it
like releases stuff out to the

756
00:46:35,902 --> 00:46:39,563
client. And then it takes
feedback, puts that into the

757
00:46:39,623 --> 00:46:42,152
roadmap and keeps the cycle
going.

758
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:46,838
Bekah: Yeah. I really love that
because, well, for a number of

759
00:46:46,842 --> 00:46:49,807
reasons, but there are so many
people that are coming into tech

760
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,407
right now that it's oversaturated
with people looking for junior

761
00:46:53,407 --> 00:46:58,027
positions. But what you've done
is you've leveraged all of your

762
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:03,353
non-technical skills or non.
Coding skills and transferred

763
00:47:03,652 --> 00:47:08,242
them over into a job that makes
you really good at that job. And

764
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:12,563
so I think that, you know,
sometimes people are developers

765
00:47:12,568 --> 00:47:16,463
and, and they move over into
different positions that are

766
00:47:16,702 --> 00:47:20,813
management and maybe they're not
well suited for those. They're

767
00:47:20,813 --> 00:47:24,983
really good at being a developer,
but also it's, that's not the

768
00:47:24,983 --> 00:47:29,003
only job that you can have if
you've gone to a bootcamp or if

769
00:47:29,003 --> 00:47:31,913
you've taught yourself how to. Or
if you have a CS degree,

770
00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:36,052
whatever, you know, there are
these tech adjacent jobs that

771
00:47:36,052 --> 00:47:40,432
require you to have this
knowledge and understanding, but

772
00:47:40,438 --> 00:47:45,983
also give you space to bring all
of the past history that you have

773
00:47:45,983 --> 00:47:52,487
doing production producing stuff
and make you really. Give you the

774
00:47:52,487 --> 00:47:55,577
ability to really Excel at what
you're doing. And I think that

775
00:47:55,788 --> 00:47:59,387
I'm glad that you're here talking
about that because I think that

776
00:47:59,807 --> 00:48:02,208
it would be great to have more
people talking about that and

777
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:06,858
getting more people in positions
like you are en enabling those

778
00:48:06,862 --> 00:48:11,568
intimate collaborations to
happen. So more people feel

779
00:48:11,568 --> 00:48:14,628
supported in tech because we also
hear so many stories at Virtual

780
00:48:14,628 --> 00:48:17,177
Coffee of people who are in
terrible jobs.

781
00:48:17,813 --> 00:48:18,413
Seth: Yes.

782
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:23,858
Bekah: and this, this. Having
more people doing what you're

783
00:48:23,858 --> 00:48:29,347
doing, I think helps to create
tech, create a much more

784
00:48:29,347 --> 00:48:30,668
welcoming tech community.

785
00:48:31,793 --> 00:48:34,672
Seth: Yeah. I appreciate you
saying that. I mean, like, like I

786
00:48:34,672 --> 00:48:37,373
said, it's, I mean really by the,
by the grace of God, honestly,

787
00:48:37,378 --> 00:48:40,943
that it even happened. Cause I.
While I was interested in it and

788
00:48:40,943 --> 00:48:45,202
I was, I was, I, I could say that
would be cool to do. I didn't

789
00:48:45,202 --> 00:48:47,543
really plan. It just kind of
happened. And at first I was

790
00:48:47,543 --> 00:48:50,302
like, what do you mean I'm not
gonna be coding out this stuff. I

791
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,762
thought you hired me as an
engineer. And it just, it was

792
00:48:52,762 --> 00:48:56,512
just a classic startup. Well, now
we know we need this and we have

793
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:59,592
a marketing engineering team,
which handles the website. Our

794
00:48:59,592 --> 00:49:05,992
integrations handles demos. So we
want you to just, we like what

795
00:49:05,998 --> 00:49:09,112
they said, this one thing they
said to me, they said, The

796
00:49:09,202 --> 00:49:12,713
technical skills you have a lot
of people have, but not many

797
00:49:12,713 --> 00:49:16,762
people have the other skills you
have. And I was like, awesome.

798
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:20,512
Like that's, that's why I believe
in developing those kind of

799
00:49:20,512 --> 00:49:25,492
skills. I call 'em relational
skills, but, um, I find it a

800
00:49:25,492 --> 00:49:28,492
little bit easier to develop
relational skills than tech

801
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:32,483
skills sometimes. And I also find
it more natural to have to be

802
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:37,538
organizational seeing the big
picture planning. but I happen to

803
00:49:37,538 --> 00:49:40,867
have a tech background, so it
helps me understand how to talk

804
00:49:40,867 --> 00:49:45,757
to designers and developers and
stuff. Um, so yeah, I just feel

805
00:49:45,757 --> 00:49:50,168
like I like, after all these
years of like wandering around

806
00:49:50,168 --> 00:49:53,467
and trying to figure it out and
like sacrificing and not giving

807
00:49:53,472 --> 00:49:57,967
up and like just pushing,
pushing, pushing I'm I'm in the

808
00:49:57,967 --> 00:50:01,387
most comfortable place I've been
in the, and I'm, I feel the

809
00:50:01,387 --> 00:50:08,018
happiest I've been in my career
maybe ever. Um, and so that's

810
00:50:08,018 --> 00:50:11,257
just such a blessing. I'm very
thankful for that. And I really

811
00:50:11,347 --> 00:50:15,068
don't know how much control I had
over it. I think it just, I, I

812
00:50:15,072 --> 00:50:18,097
don't know. You could say, you
know that, well, if you put

813
00:50:18,097 --> 00:50:20,137
yourself out there, things will
happen or whatever. There's a lot

814
00:50:20,137 --> 00:50:22,148
of philosophies you could and
beliefs, you could say, but

815
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:25,327
really to me, it's just, it's
just a natural progression that,

816
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:29,257
that happen happened. And I was
able to see what it was and go,

817
00:50:29,288 --> 00:50:33,998
ah, yes, this is it. This is,
this is it. This is it. I feel

818
00:50:33,998 --> 00:50:36,967
like I'm thriving. And I, and
like I said before, I feel

819
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:42,248
valued. I feel empowered because
of my company. And because I'm

820
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:46,947
in, I'm of a comfort zone where
before front end development,

821
00:50:46,947 --> 00:50:49,108
there were often times I was out
of my comfort zone.

822
00:50:50,135 --> 00:50:51,275
Bekah: Yeah, I love that.

823
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:55,014
Dan: Yeah, so, I mean, I pretty
much just wanna wrap up here. I

824
00:50:55,014 --> 00:50:57,864
think, I think this seemed like a
good place to stop in general.

825
00:50:57,894 --> 00:51:01,434
Um, I, I mean, I personally
really appreciated hearing your

826
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,724
story. I, and I, I liked about
hearing about product owners and,

827
00:51:05,724 --> 00:51:08,184
you know, I, I love this idea of
the producer, like the creative

828
00:51:08,184 --> 00:51:12,699
producer and applying to. um, to
tech, I think it's, I think it's

829
00:51:12,699 --> 00:51:15,190
a fantastic approach and there's
probably, there's probably plenty

830
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,369
of people that are doing it and
not, uh, using that name, you

831
00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:18,760
know, or not

832
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:19,750
Seth: exactly. Yeah.

833
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:24,489
Dan: Um, you know, I think that,
that, uh, your instincts behind

834
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:26,980
doing all that is, um, are really
spot on and I think you're gonna

835
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,869
be really valuable. Um,

836
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:30,849
Seth: Yeah. I appreciate that,
man.

837
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:34,579
Dan: I think it's really cool.
And, um, I think it's a, I think

838
00:51:34,579 --> 00:51:38,090
it's a very cool skill set and. I
don't know if you wanna call it

839
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:41,599
talent or whatever, but like, uh,
just a valuable thing for, for

840
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,909
any company, you know, anybody
that's producing software, um,

841
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:45,590
to, to have somebody like that.

842
00:51:46,445 --> 00:51:49,355
Seth: well, I mean, it's, it
takes so much to do anything,

843
00:51:49,355 --> 00:51:52,684
right. Even a basic website.
It's, it's a lot to wrangle

844
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:56,434
together and it's a lot to think
about and it, so it helps to have

845
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:59,315
a team of people who have
different, I guess you could say

846
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:03,574
skill sets or leanings or
whatever, but I. Because not

847
00:52:03,574 --> 00:52:06,364
everybody is gonna be, you know,
a great backend developer, but

848
00:52:06,364 --> 00:52:08,434
you're gonna need backend
development. So it's, it's just a

849
00:52:08,434 --> 00:52:12,125
part of the team I look at as a
team, as a whole, just, just like

850
00:52:12,275 --> 00:52:15,155
when I was doing film, like it
takes a village to make something

851
00:52:15,664 --> 00:52:20,284
in, in software and, you know,
web development is the exact same

852
00:52:20,434 --> 00:52:23,324
in most cases, but there are some
people out there who can just do

853
00:52:23,324 --> 00:52:26,465
it by themselves. And I've always
looked at them in amazement, but,

854
00:52:26,465 --> 00:52:29,405
uh, I'm a big believer in just
the team, the collaboration.

855
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:33,155
Someone to bounce ideas off of
you don't feel alone. The burden

856
00:52:33,155 --> 00:52:34,894
is shared, you know, all those
things.

857
00:52:36,815 --> 00:52:40,985
Bekah: I love that. Well, before
we wrap up, is there any last

858
00:52:40,985 --> 00:52:44,565
words of wisdom or any projects
that you wanna talk about?

859
00:52:46,094 --> 00:52:49,655
Seth: Um, not really any
projects. I mean, I just, I did

860
00:52:49,655 --> 00:52:54,034
have a, a little win, uh, this
week I had my first release ever

861
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:57,364
in, in this role, this kind of
role, like I was responsible for.

862
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,800
Everything that comes with the
release. Now, granted it's

863
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,920
internal, right? I'm I'm not
running a product, you know, or

864
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,360
we have users, but so it's a
little bit, uh, little bit less

865
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,880
pressure maybe cuz it's internal
and you got people who are

866
00:53:10,885 --> 00:53:12,980
forgiving and you're working to
get it out and you don't have

867
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:16,730
users yelling at you on Twitter
or whatever. But, um, but no,

868
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:20,389
it's no particular projects.
Just, you know, I, I just, we've

869
00:53:20,389 --> 00:53:22,849
talked about this a lot in, in
Virtual Coffee, like transferable

870
00:53:22,849 --> 00:53:26,525
skills I think are really
important. So anybody. I think

871
00:53:26,525 --> 00:53:29,434
there's a lot of things that
people might know or might be

872
00:53:29,434 --> 00:53:33,695
good at. They don't realize they
could apply and, and it could be

873
00:53:33,699 --> 00:53:37,534
technical, but it's might be
mostly relational, you know,

874
00:53:37,534 --> 00:53:40,295
like, cuz you gotta remember
that. We're what we're doing.

875
00:53:41,434 --> 00:53:45,244
Like people will hire you based
on your, how you are as a person.

876
00:53:46,025 --> 00:53:49,625
More so than your technical
skills, cuz you can teach techno

877
00:53:50,074 --> 00:53:52,264
technical skills, but you can't
teach someone, teach someone to

878
00:53:52,264 --> 00:53:56,284
be nice or have integrity or have
good character. You know, that's

879
00:53:56,284 --> 00:53:59,135
a thing you people say. So I
don't know where I'm going with

880
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:00,155
this, but um,

881
00:54:00,492 --> 00:54:01,974
Bekah: think. Great advice.

882
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,518
Seth: Just, uh, keep going.
that's an easy, that's an easy,

883
00:54:06,668 --> 00:54:09,009
uh, you know, outro, just keep,
keep going and believe in

884
00:54:09,009 --> 00:54:12,338
yourself. And hopefully you'll,
if something will, something

885
00:54:12,344 --> 00:54:13,059
should pop up.

886
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,179
Bekah: yeah, it's so great.
Thanks so much for being here and

887
00:54:15,179 --> 00:54:15,960
sharing your story with

888
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:17,280
Dan: Thanks, Seth.

889
00:54:17,474 --> 00:54:19,425
