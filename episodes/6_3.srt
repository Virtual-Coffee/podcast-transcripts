00:00:05,136 --> 00:00:06,916
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 6, Episode 3

2
00:00:06,916 --> 00:00:08,696
of

3
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:11,223
the Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

4
00:00:11,223 --> 00:00:13,745
that

5
00:00:13,746 --> 00:00:17,527
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

6
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:19,027
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

7
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:20,527
their

8
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:23,196
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

9
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:25,000
stories, and what they've
learned. And we're here to

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,137
share it with you.

11
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:28,867
Here with me today is my
co-host, Dan.

12
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,207
Dan Ott: Wuddup, Bek! How's it
going?

13
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:33,726
Bekah: [Chuckles] It is ...
amazing.

14
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:35,946
Dan: [Laughs] I'm serious. It-
it- it just gives me so much

15
00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:37,356
energy

16
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:40,087
coming in like that. I-I- I
can't- I can't- I can't do

17
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:40,656
anything else anymore.

18
00:00:42,832 --> 00:00:44,121
Bekah: I-it is what it is.

19
00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:51,606
Dan: [Laughs] Yeah. So today we
are continuing our streak

20
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:55,996
of awesome guests that started
Season 1 Episode 1 [laughs] with

21
00:00:56,046 --> 00:01:01,597
Seth Hall. Seth is a Technical
Product Owner at Uniform. And --

22
00:01:02,152 --> 00:01:03,546
so, one of the questions you
might ask is, what is a

23
00:01:03,546 --> 00:01:04,940
technical

24
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:08,391
product owner mean? And I'm glad
you asked that because Seth

25
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:10,852
talked about it. He explained
what that means, and why he's

26
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:15,412
so happy in that role. It's sort
of a organic transition for him,

27
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:19,162
from being a, you know, a -- I
was gonna say regular developer,

28
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:21,000
but that's not- that's not fair.
But, you know, being an

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
[chuckles] individual
contributor developer to this

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,962
new role as a product owner.

31
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:27,471
Bekah: Yeah.

32
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:28,552
Dan: It was really cool to hear
about.

33
00:01:28,686 --> 00:01:31,927
Bekah: Well, and I love, too, he
talked about his transferable

34
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:36,516
skills as a creative producer.
So his background in filmmaking

35
00:01:36,516 --> 00:01:39,000
and how he brought that over to
what he's doing now, which

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,537
for me was

37
00:01:40,537 --> 00:01:43,746
a really interesting exploration
of, you know, overlapping that

38
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:47,677
creative process with what he's
doing as a technical product

39
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:47,956
owner.

40
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:53,751
Dan: Yes. Absolutely. The- the
idea of a producer in, you know,

41
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:56,242
everybody's heard of a producer
in- in the entertainment

42
00:01:56,242 --> 00:02:00,000
industry, and movies, and TV.
And, of course, there's not

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,816
always a lot of

44
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:03,000
clarity about what a producer
does [chuckles] in -- for a

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,387
movie, but-

46
00:02:04,777 --> 00:02:08,796
but the ... oh, man. Now I can't
remember what kind of producer

47
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,000
he said is, the one that does
what he's doing. Do you remember

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,287
what it is?

49
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:11,752
Bekah: Creative producer.

50
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:15,097
Dan: Creative producer. Okay.
And so a creative producer is a

51
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:18,007
person who's kind of responsible
for shepherding a -- the- the

52
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,374
project, you know, from
beginning to end, and make a lot

53
00:02:19,374 --> 00:02:20,736
-- make

54
00:02:20,736 --> 00:02:24,937
connections between people, and
doing a lot more than, you

55
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,396
know, maybe a project manager or
something like that role -- kind

56
00:02:27,396 --> 00:02:32,766
of role. And it was really cool.
And I- I- I love the ... I love

57
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:34,461
that idea. And I lo- [chuckles]
I love, like, placing these-

58
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:36,156
these

59
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:39,037
frameworks -- mental frameworks
from other industries on top of

60
00:02:39,037 --> 00:02:41,272
dev stuff, and- and seeing how
we either have a role that's

61
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:43,507
like

62
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:44,647
that, and it's just name
something different, or- or

63
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:45,787
maybe

64
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:49,000
something, you know, the- the
dev industry can actually use

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,257
to be- become

66
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:52,500
better, you know? And I think --
I feel like creative

67
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,287
producer here is

68
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:56,796
like one of those- one of those,
like, really cool -- it- it,

69
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:59,467
likes, I dunno. It seemed like a
very cool idea to me [chuckles].

70
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:00,756
Bekah: Yeah. And I love how he
talked about — he used the

71
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:01,640
phrase

72
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:05,872
'intimate collaboration', and I
think that that sums up what

73
00:03:05,872 --> 00:03:08,107
really makes somebody good at
that job. But th-that's one of

74
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:10,342
those

75
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:13,731
things that -- it's- it's not a
common phrase or a common idea

76
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:16,086
when you're thinking about what
a technical product owner does,

77
00:03:16,086 --> 00:03:18,441
or a

78
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:20,442
producer, but that -- those
connections are what really

79
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:22,132
allow

80
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:23,301
people to be successful.

81
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:27,336
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. It was-
it was cool. It was very good

82
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:27,637
talking to Seth.

83
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,461
Bekah: Yeah. And we start this
episode of the podcast like we

84
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,531
start every Virtual Coffee. With
our names, where we're from,

85
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:35,601
what

86
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:37,658
we do, and answering a random
check-in question. So we hope

87
00:03:37,658 --> 00:03:39,710
you

88
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:51,300
enjoy this episode. Today's
random check-in question is,

89
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:55,110
describe a time you laughed so
hard you thought you would cry

90
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,419
or when you did cry. I'm not
sure if that makes sense. What

91
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,810
was so funny? [Laughs] Did you
ge-

92
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,889
Dan: Did you read that question
before ... just now? What is-

93
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:09,000
what is happening?

94
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:10,860
Bekah: I did! When we were
setting up the- the podca- when

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,060
scheduling everybody. I put
questions in all of them. So

96
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,500
it's been a minute.

97
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,000
Dan: Okay, okay, okay.

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,867
Bekah: [Giggles] My name is
Bekah. I am a technical

99
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:21,734
community

100
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:29,000
builder. And laugh so hard ...
that I cried. I feel like these

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,925
-- those

102
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:34,305
moments are great, and I can
remember them happening and who

103
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:39,285
they happened with, but I cannot
remember why they happened. So,

104
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:45,360
like, normally, it's with people
I'm very close friends with or

105
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,589
with my brothers -- usually it's
my brothers. And I'm usually

106
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:55,000
laughing at them, and not with
them [chuckles]. So, I don't

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,230
know. I have

108
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:59,819
to think about that more. But I
guess I'm laughing so -- oh. I'm

109
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:01,064
trying to think, there was one,
that was recently. I was

110
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:02,309
laughing

111
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,000
so hard [silence] I don't know.
I have to come back to it.

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,980
Sending it over to you, Dan.

113
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,834
Dan: All right. Hello. My name
is Dan. I am from Lakewood,

114
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:17,375
Ohio, the first suburb west of
Cleveland. I do web development.

115
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:20,555
And, yeah. I have- I have these-
I have these laughing

116
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:23,964
issues from time to time.
Honestly, mostly with my family.

117
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:27,235
I don't- I don't know exactly
why. But, yeah. And my mom

118
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:29,725
gets it too. So sometimes I'll
just like have to cover my face

119
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:34,254
and, you know, be laughing a
lot, and probably crying in.

120
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:41,300
The one time that really ...
comes to mind ... ha- have you

121
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,000
guys seen the -- this, like, the
screaming goat videos?

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Seth Hall: Yes.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Dan: Like, they were, like,
popular a while ago. And,

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,990
there's -- so there's one that's

125
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,000
like a -- there -- so people
started mixing 'em into songs,

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,589
you know? And

127
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:55,339
the -- and there's like this --
the- the Taylor Swift song,

128
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:58,000
the ... that's like the ...
[singing] I know you were

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,001
trouble. Or how's that song go?

130
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:00,709
Bekah: [Singing] I know you --

131
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:02,600
Dan: Some -- there's some -- but
there's --

132
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,230
Bekah: [Singing] You walked in
--

133
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,615
Dan: There's some part of that
hook, and then there's the

134
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,185
screaming goat. And it, like,
just kills me every time. And I

135
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:11,500
-- we were like playing it on my
phone, you know, with- with

136
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,004
my family

137
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,000
in, like, the living room
[laughs]. And I just like --

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,495
I could, like -- I was

139
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,134
laughing for probably, like, 15
minutes [laughs]. Cuz my sister

140
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:19,000
started -- just every time I'd
calm down, she'd played it

141
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,060
again, you know? That was it.

142
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,000
Bekah: There- there was a --

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Dan: [Laughs] I cannot stand
this.

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,170
Bekah: I -- it was an Instagram
reel or a

145
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,139
TikTok, that was similar. Where
somebody was going to film

146
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,209
themselves, and while -- before
they got started, they

147
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:31,279
accidentally

148
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:35,000
like threw their hip into the
side of a bed, and they-

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Dan: Oh, yeah [chuckles]. I saw
that.

150
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Bekah: -screamed out, and then,
everybody remixed it. So they

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,470
screamed like, "Ah!" And

152
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,040
so then people are like, "Eh,"
you know, like, staying alive.

153
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,500
"Ah!" it would start with that,
and then somebody would go on?

154
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,519
[Seth laughs] That was really
good.

155
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:51,274
Dan: All right. Wait. I think I
can- I- I think I can -- oh,

156
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:54,485
can I change my microphone while
we're recording? That

157
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:58,834
possible? Might not be possible.
I was gonna play it for

158
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,305
everybody, but ... I don't think
I --

159
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:01,865
Bekah: Link- link in the show
notes.

160
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,970
Dan: Yep. I'll put the link in
the show notes so that we don't

161
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,000
-- I'll have to listen to me
breaking down again [chuckles].

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,540
Probably a good call.

163
00:07:08,884 --> 00:07:12,574
Bekah: I used to laugh so hard
when we started the podcast.

164
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:17,600
Dan: Yes. That was always fun.
It was fun making that happen.

165
00:07:17,764 --> 00:07:18,185
Seth: It was out of nervousness
maybe? Or out of fun?

166
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:19,910
Bekah: It was. It was, like,
straight up nerv-

167
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:20,779
Seth: The red light- red light
syndrome?

168
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,439
Dan: Yeah.

169
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,050
Bekah: Dan would be like, "Go!"
And I'd start the intro, could

170
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,079
not hold it together. Could not!
It took me -- like, even if I

171
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:30,680
was recording it by myself, it
took a really long time. Maybe

172
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:32,329
Season 2 is when I finally
calmed down [chuckles]. Like --

173
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:33,125
Dan: Yeah.

174
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:33,800
Seth: Yep, yep.

175
00:07:34,535 --> 00:07:38,045
Dan: Yeah. I- I also, like, the
-- like, times where you are

176
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:40,444
really not supposed to laugh,
but you're -- like, standing in

177
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:43,235
front of somebody, whatever, but
you make eye contact with- with

178
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:43,236
one of your friends or-

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Seth: Oh, yes. Sure.

180
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,694
Dan: -you know, somebody who
knows you're trying not to

181
00:07:45,694 --> 00:07:47,884
laugh or whatever, tho- those
are always really fun for me

182
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:49,055
too [chuckles]. Except when I'm
[unintelligible] --

183
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,000
Seth: That's a good- that's a
good segue into mine. My name

184
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,230
is Seth Hall.

185
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,521
I'm a Technical Product Owner at
Uniform. And for me, laughter

186
00:07:56,521 --> 00:08:00,841
has been a huge part of my life,
just with all my friends. You

187
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:03,120
know, I think it initially
started as a coping mechanism,

188
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,380
just from my childhood. But I
was always like cracking up in

189
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,000
school, in -- I mean, I remember
one time, my cousin and I were

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,490
at a funeral or something.

191
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,860
We were, like, eight years old
at a funeral. And, like,

192
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,560
we had to be separated. We were
laughing so hard. But we, like,

193
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,920
found each other through the
pews, you know, across the whole

194
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,071
church and we're still cracking
up, you know? And so,

195
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:26,430
laughter has been a great
medicine for me, but it's got me

196
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,201
in trouble a lot. But- but,
yeah. So it's just like such a

197
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:34,951
healing thing for me. And I- and
I still have great friends that

198
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:38,730
we just instantly crack up with-
with our inside humor, right? I

199
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,750
mean, no one else think it would
-- no one else would think it

200
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,770
was

201
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,801
funny, but- but, yeah. So I --
I'm like Bekah. I can't think of

202
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:47,341
a specific time, you know,
another specific time, but it's

203
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:51,000
always been a constant kinda
thing for me. And- and it --

204
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,770
if I can laugh

205
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,221
with you, then I'm already feel
like a halfway, like, you're my

206
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:58,831
best friend, you know what I
mean? And then if we can talk

207
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:02,160
about, like, deep stuff, like,
real authentic stuff, then

208
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,051
we're like, we're best mates. So
... but, yeah.

209
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:05,311
Bekah: Yeah. There --

210
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,301
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

211
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,850
Bekah: I -- that reminded me of
a time. I was at church with a

212
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,561
classmate. And one of us, we're
like singing in church, right?

213
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,181
And saying the wrong verse,
right? And it's, like, very

214
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:22,000
loudly. And then there was like,
no [Seth laughs], no,

215
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
coming back-

216
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Seth: Yeah. Yeah.

217
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,841
Bekah: -laughing so hard. We

218
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:27,990
were definitely crying. Somebody
had to get up and leave because

219
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,000
it was just, like, totally
inappropriate-

220
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Seth: Yeah.

221
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,870
Bekah: -and disruptive. Which,
like, makes it

222
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,730
even funnier [laughs], in a way?
I feel like- like --

223
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:35,000
Seth: Would be even funnier.
Yeah. I mean, I- I hate to

224
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,931
even think about what my to- put

225
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:40,000
my teachers through in school. I
mean ... I just was like --

226
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,931
it- it- it, for me,

227
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:47,671
like, if I had known comedy was
actually a- a- a career, back in

228
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,000
then -- like, nowadays people-
people, like, "Oh, you gotta

229
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,900
improv, and all

230
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,880
these different YouTube things,"
and, like, people go, "I wanna

231
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,941
be a comedian." They go and they
pursue that. But I never even

232
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:59,551
knew it was a career, but I
listened to comedy constant-

233
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:02,000
constantly growing up. And then
the thrill of making people

234
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,061
laugh, which was

235
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,811
what I did a ton of, it just,
like, was like a huge, like,

236
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:09,571
thrill. I mean, it was great.
And I, like, couldn't get enough

237
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:11,000
of it. And to the point where I
said it was- it was actually

238
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,051
disrespectful, you know,

239
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:16,000
now that I look back [chuckles].
But that's- that's part of being

240
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,951
-- part

241
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:19,081
of growing up, I guess. Being
young, and immature, and stuff.

242
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,000
Bekah: Yeah, always. I always --
if there were a personality

243
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,686
trait that I

244
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:26,000
could just, like, download into
my brain, it would be

245
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,076
m-making people

246
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:29,176
laugh. I don't know. That's not
really a personality trait.

247
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:29,176
Seth: Oh, yeah.

248
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:31,000
Bekah: But you know what?
[Chuckles] I always would love

249
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,775
to make people laugh. My grandma
was

250
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,061
really great at it. And I always
wish that, like, I had that same

251
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:39,990
ability because it kind of what
you're saying, Seth, that idea

252
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,921
of you -- if you can laugh
together with somebody, then

253
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:46,000
you're friends, and then that
does often lead to that

254
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,370
opportunity to dive

255
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,640
deeper into things. Because
there's this almost like built

256
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:52,000
in trust that happens when you
can-

257
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Seth: Yeah.

258
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,051
Bekah: -get into that deep
laughter together.

259
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,000
Seth: That's right. Totally.

260
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Bekah: Well, thanks --

261
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,966
Seth: It's a good question.

262
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:01,000
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah! I what --
now, I'm like, what is the

263
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,311
neurobiology of

264
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:07,171
laughing together? [Seth laughs]
Thanks for being here with us

265
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:08,000
today, Seth. We're very-

266
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Seth: My pleasure.

267
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,321
Bekah: -excited to have you on
the podcast.

268
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,046
Seth: Thanks for having me. It
is awesome.

269
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:16,110
Bekah: Yeah! We always like to
start with origin stories. So

270
00:11:16,115 --> 00:11:21,030
how have you got to this point
in your world -- of your- your

271
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:22,561
journey of Seth -- being Seth
Hall?

272
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,666
Seth: Yeah, sure. I'll- I'll
give you the- I'll give you the

273
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:30,000
short version [laughs]. Yeah.
So, for me ... let's just --

274
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,245
I'll just

275
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:34,000
start with kinda ... how I ended
up in development. Like,

276
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,216
wh-when I was --

277
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:38,000
I know -- I always liked
creative stuff growing up.

278
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,096
I was always ... I- I grew

279
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,000
up in a single family home. I
had a lot of, like, time to

280
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,096
myself and-

281
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:47,145
and- and music was a big escape
for me. So when I became an

282
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:49,000
adult, you know, all I just say
when -- in my 20s, I was like,

283
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,375
"I am gonna

284
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,691
do something different. I'm not
gonna do a typical path that you

285
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:58,530
take or you're told that you're
supposed to take." So, I

286
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,000
graduate- graduated from
college, and then went and

287
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,321
pursued music. So I played

288
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:06,331
independent music for, you know,
for a long time. I also

289
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:08,711
did video production and film
production during all that time.

290
00:12:09,571 --> 00:12:13,500
And then I continued, you know,
did music for about -- pretty

291
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,280
hardcore for 15 years. Then I
just kind of transitioned into

292
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,825
the video, film, and then I
kinda got into digital stuff,

293
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:20,370
got my

294
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,831
first computer, and was like,
you know, graphic design,

295
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,000
learning how to log into web
apps, and all that kind of

296
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,461
stuff, back in 2006.

297
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:30,841
And then 2011, in the middle of
my film and video pursuits, I

298
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:33,750
started making websites. And it
wasn't really planned. It just

299
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,091
kinda happened. And so I started
teaching myself

300
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:39,091
WordPress and all that- all that
stuff, you know? That kinda

301
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:44,760
normal story. I got my first
tech job in 2013. During that

302
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,091
job, I wa- I decided I wanna go
get my master's in film

303
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,150
producing. So I went to a film
school here, in North Carolina,

304
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:54,961
called University of North
Carolina School of the Arts.

305
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:59,000
And ... that was a great
experience. I loved it. I took

306
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,941
a break from

307
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:02,850
coding for a while to produce
videos for the school, actually,

308
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,191
in their marketing department. I
made like three or four short

309
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:09,240
films. But then I got to a point
where I was like, "Okay.

310
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,181
I don't really wanna make videos
anymore cuz I've done that so

311
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:15,811
much. Filmmaking doesn't pay." I
thought, "Well, maybe I'll

312
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:19,171
do like a -- go back into
development or maybe I'll --

313
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:21,000
maybe do something developer
adjacent." So I, like, thought

314
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,841
about being a

315
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:24,421
Scrum Master, you know? I was
like, "I've worked in Agile."

316
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,941
And so I kinda pursued that a
little bit. And then I realized,

317
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:30,150
"You know what? I really like
development." So I -- so two

318
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,000
thou- and it -- just, you know,
it's- it's -- a lot of

319
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,360
opportunities, and

320
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,890
it pays well, and it's fun, and
challenging. So back in 2019

321
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:39,735
December, I jumped back in full
force, and shortly after, I

322
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,399
joined

323
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,211
Virtual Coffee, you know? And-
and so, for all of 2020 and all

324
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:49,380
of 2021, I basically was doing
front-end development. Multiple

325
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,640
contracts, some of 'em were
toxic. Some of 'em were --

326
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:57,676
didn't value me. Like, they
weren't great experiences.

327
00:13:58,096 --> 00:13:59,625
But I just kept pursuing, kept
pursuing, kept pursuing. And

328
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,154
then

329
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:07,306
I found a job at Uniform -- a
job posting at Uniform. I -- it

330
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:10,005
sounded just like me. It was- it
was working in the Jamstack as

331
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:14,000
a front-end developer. It wasn't
a ... product. It was,

332
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,015
like, demos. So,

333
00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:19,066
like, our internal team demos
our product with, like, fake

334
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,000
websites, essentially. So I was
like, "Oh, that's great." I

335
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,225
can make --

336
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:24,586
basically make client websites
without the client, you know?

337
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:28,096
I can make -- I can be a part of
a product team without being on

338
00:14:28,096 --> 00:14:31,816
the product team, you know? And
so, I got hired as a demo

339
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:35,025
engineer, and I've been working
for them for about four

340
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:39,586
months now, maybe five months.
But shortly after I got hired,

341
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:42,000
it was -- it be-became evident
that ... what they really

342
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,041
needed was someone to 'own'

343
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,490
the demos. Like, product own the
demos, not actually code the

344
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,821
demos. So I transitioned to a
technical product owner where

345
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:55,971
I'm working with designers, tech
lead for developers,

346
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,000
marketers, sales engineers,
like, I'm working with a lot

347
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,270
of people

348
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,211
to kinda guide all the demo
tracks and demo initiatives we

349
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,000
have. But I'm- I'm -- like, now,
I'm planning roadmaps.

350
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,306
I'm- I'm- I'm basically

351
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,696
producing. Like I- like I did in
film, like, was -- with

352
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:14,265
film, I used to do camera sound,
editing all the stuff. Then I

353
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:17,836
moved to producing where I was,
like, hiring those people, and

354
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:20,265
knew what they were doing, and I
was planning the project. Well,

355
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,000
now, it's- it's -- an
interesting equivalent is I'll

356
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,905
-- I used to

357
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:25,426
be in the trenches of front-end
as y'all know, cuz we've talked

358
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:28,000
many times about it. But now
I'm, like, planning that stuff.

359
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,311
So I'm-

360
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,971
I'm not the developer, but I'm a
developer adjacent. So my

361
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:36,451
initial, you know, thought back
in 2019, where maybe I could do

362
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:39,900
something developer adjacent,
has like come to fruition, like,

363
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,681
on accident. And I am absolutely
loving it. So- so that's kind of

364
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:47,581
where and how I ended up here.
You know, to me, development is

365
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:51,000
very much aligns with my- my
goals in life. It's, like,

366
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,230
it's- it's

367
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,801
creative, it's challenging, it's
fun, it's flexible. It doesn't

368
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:59,581
rule my life, you know? I get to
go to work in my office, and get

369
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:02,130
to leave, and be with my family.
So, like, everything I wanted

370
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,000
when I was 20, when I pursued
music and film, I have f-found

371
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,030
that. I

372
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:13,081
have found autonomy, good pay,
satis- satisfactory work. And

373
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm not -- like, it's very
unique too, in- in- in a way.

374
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,471
Even though there's

375
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:18,571
a lot of developers, it's still
a unique way to make a living.

376
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:21,000
Cuz most people I talked to
don't do what I do. So it all

377
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,321
-- it fit -- checks

378
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:25,576
all the boxes for me. So- so,
yeah. That's- that's kind of

379
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:29,655
my origin story and- and- and --
a professional origin story.

380
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:32,000
And I'm very happy where I am.
I'm, like, I haven't been

381
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,946
happier in- in the-

382
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:36,916
in the- in the tech -- in my
tech career than I am now. So --

383
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:41,456
Bekah: Yeah, I love that. I
wanna backtrack just a second.

384
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,971
And so, you've done a lot of
different things. I love how you

385
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,000
say that this kind of, like,
mimics some of the things that

386
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,610
you were

387
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:52,500
doing before with producing, and
how those skills lead here. But-

388
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:52,561
Seth: Mm-hmm.

389
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:55,000
Bekah: -was there, like, a
pivotal moment for you when you

390
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,490
decided that you

391
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:59,490
were ready to make this
transition? Because, you know, I

392
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,120
think it's sometimes hard to --
you're kind of toying with the

393
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,631
idea or maybe you take on a
little bit of side work, but at

394
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:11,010
some point, you have to say,
"There's a career transition and

395
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,540
now I'm going to go all in."

396
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:17,701
Seth: Yeah. So from, like, film
to web was literally wasn't

397
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:20,000
planned at all. It was- it was
-- I sort of just felt this

398
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,066
call and this draw to

399
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:25,185
do it. And all of a sudden I had
four clients — four WordPress

400
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:28,000
clients. And this is, like, had
no experience. So I was

401
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,086
doing all of

402
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:31,365
the stuff you do to learn
WordPress. And of course, that's

403
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:33,826
not the best platform to learn
on because it's super confusing.

404
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:34,486
Bekah: Yes.

405
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,000
Seth: But I mean -- but that's
good. I was in the trenches.

406
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,125
So it was

407
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:39,586
never a conscious effort. It was
just something that I ended up

408
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:43,516
doing and I just did it cuz I
liked it. And I worked nights

409
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:46,846
and weekends cuz I liked it. And
then it started paying. Then I

410
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:50,266
got my first tech job, you know?
And- and so -- but the

411
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:55,036
transition between a- a
front-end engineer to a product

412
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:59,000
owner that was very much ... a
welcome transition. Because as

413
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,865
y'all have

414
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:04,996
seen or know, like, front-end
development ... parts of it are

415
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:09,000
... easy? Quote, unquote, easy.
But a lot of it is really

416
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,296
difficult. And

417
00:18:11,296 --> 00:18:14,000
I just found myself --  I was
just was getting tired of the

418
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,736
grind. I was getting tired

419
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:20,086
of like, not breaking through,
and not, you know, not -- still

420
00:18:20,086 --> 00:18:22,546
not knowing stuff, and still not
knowing how to learn stuff I

421
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:25,185
don't know. And- and, yeah. I
could, you know, put together a

422
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:29,086
Jamstack site. I could do some
product feature work and stuff,

423
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:32,000
but it just got to be ...
exhausting. And my skill sets

424
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,766
are- are very

425
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:38,776
much relational communicate-
communicative, listening,

426
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:43,000
validating, planning. I mean,
I'm engineering. The-there's a

427
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
-- my -- in my personal life,
I'm, like, producing the biggest

428
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,355
thing I've ever done,

429
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:52,455
which might come up. But, like,
my mindset and my default is

430
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:55,000
like to dig in there and
organize a- a big thing. And

431
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,296
that could be a- a-a movie,

432
00:18:56,445 --> 00:19:00,675
that could be -- now it's a
three different demo tracks, you

433
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:03,000
know? And in- in my life, it's
a, you know, other personal

434
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,276
stuff that I'm ...

435
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:08,000
producing, essentially. And so-
so, yeah. So it was --

436
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,671
the- the initial

437
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,550
thing wasn't a conscious effort.
It really was outta nowhere. And

438
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,800
I was kinda like, "What?" Like,
"This doesn't make any sense.

439
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm trying to pursue film. What-
what do you mean -- what's

440
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,590
going on here?"

441
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:20,191
But at -- it- it quickly became
something like, "Okay, this is

442
00:19:20,195 --> 00:19:22,171
really good for me." Yeah.

443
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:26,355
Dan: So you used the word
'producing' a few times there.

444
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,000
And that's a word that you don't
usually hear in the-

445
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,566
the development,

446
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:32,415
like, aside of things, right?
But you hear it a lot in

447
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:35,000
entertainment. And- and -- so, I
was just wondering if- if

448
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,596
there -- your

449
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:38,000
experience with ... you know,
in- in film school and stuff

450
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,601
like that ...

451
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,000
you know, the producer of ik-
I'm not in the entertainment

452
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,471
[laughs]. I- I listen to

453
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:45,000
some podcasts and stuff, you
know, but like-

454
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Seth: Yeah.

455
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Dan: -if- if there's- if there's
some bit of that you took away,

456
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,181
from the -- from

457
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:54,000
film school to guide your work
now a-as a- as a sort of

458
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,391
[unintelligible], you know?

459
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:57,810
Seth: 100%. Totally, totally.
You- you know, in- in-

460
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,000
in software, we'd call it
project management, I guess.

461
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,540
You know?

462
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,000
Dan: Yeah, right. But that's,
like, yeah. That's the -- I

463
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,270
don't feel

464
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,510
like that covers every -- to me,
the- the word 'producer' has-

465
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,000
has a- a bit of a different
connota- I mean, it's close,

466
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,701
you know? It's overlap.

467
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:08,705
Seth: Yeah.

468
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,891
Dan: But, like, a bit of a
different connotation, I think.

469
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:13,000
It's a good word to use, but I'd
like to hear what you --

470
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,770
like --

471
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:15,580
Seth: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So
I- so I got my ma-

472
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,691
Dan: Wh- what do you think of it
-- what do you think of that?

473
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:19,066
Seth: Yeah, it's a good
question. I got my master's

474
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:22,155
in creative producing, which --
so, in film, there's a lot of

475
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,526
different producers. There's,
like, your boots on the ground

476
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:27,826
producer, there's- there's
associate producers, there's

477
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:31,000
executive producers who, like,
fund it or make a connection,

478
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,546
and they

479
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:34,246
get a credit. But then the
creative producer is the one

480
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,000
that, like, comes up with the
idea or, like, options of

481
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,016
script. Bekah, you

482
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:40,501
know about this. And then they-
they hire the writer. They-

483
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:41,986
they-

484
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:43,590
they develop the script. And
then they take the script into

485
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,134
...

486
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,871
raising money or- or making a
pitch deck to raise money. And

487
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:51,391
then they take that money, and
they go into pre-production, and

488
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:52,830
then they keep going through
production, and post, and

489
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,269
marketing,

490
00:20:54,276 --> 00:20:55,968
and distribution. So creative
producer is like the unsung

491
00:20:55,968 --> 00:20:57,660
hero,

492
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,951
essentially ... in film. Because
most film, it- it falls on the

493
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:04,921
director or the star of the
movie. It -- but- but producer

494
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:07,471
doesn't get much credit. But
without the producer, it

495
00:21:07,471 --> 00:21:11,000
wouldn't even exist. And so ...
all through that process,

496
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,961
really, that- that process

497
00:21:12,961 --> 00:21:16,000
is all about, like ... it's all
about, like, you know, for

498
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,875
example, like,

499
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:22,336
what are we trying to say? Like,
you know, in a- in a- in a --

500
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,000
who's- who's our audience,
right? Both of those things

501
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,086
can translate to- to

502
00:21:26,145 --> 00:21:29,596
a product in- in software. And
then like, who are the people

503
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,596
I'm working with? How do I
communicate with them ... that

504
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:36,000
translates to software? And
then- then the nuts and bolts

505
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,885
of it all

506
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:40,695
which is let's- let's- let's
plan the project and actually

507
00:21:40,695 --> 00:21:45,000
do the work, same thing in
software. And so, it- it -- I

508
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,750
just -- it just seems

509
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,411
like a perfect thing for me
because it's, like, already

510
00:21:49,411 --> 00:21:51,000
what I was good at. And I've
already got all the experience

511
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,411
in it, and it

512
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,280
100% is transferable over to
software. It's just different-

513
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,671
different medium and different
ways to do it. Like, you

514
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:03,540
don't have editors and, you
know, in software, but you have

515
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,300
QA, you know, Quality and
Assurance or whatever. You don't

516
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,280
have sound audio mixers, but you
have, you know, front-end

517
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,391
developers or backend or
security or whatever. So- so I

518
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:19,000
learned a ton going to school.
Like, I learned -- I- I took

519
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,171
what I

520
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,830
had already learned in life and
then, like, just applied it to

521
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:27,211
intimate collaboration and then,
like, different personalities,

522
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:29,000
and different cultures, and
different ages, and different

523
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,766
genders, and everything.

524
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,906
Like -- cuz when I went to art
school, I was like 20 years

525
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:33,046
older

526
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:35,655
than most people. And there was
a ton of people that were just

527
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:40,000
different than me, but I really
just got to ... res- respect

528
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,875
them, and see what

529
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,945
they were about, and learn how
to be with them, and learn how

530
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:47,655
to deal with conflict, and- and-
and learn how to persevere on a

531
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:51,405
giant project that seems never
ending. And that is software

532
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:55,336
development in many ways. So,
that's kind of what I

533
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:57,000
transferred over and it feels --
it- it's just same skill

534
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,881
set. Just different application,
essentially.

535
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:03,855
Dan: I love that. I love that a
lot. And you hit one of our --

536
00:23:03,976 --> 00:23:06,976
Virtual Coffee bingo words,
which is intimate. And I think

537
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:07,000
you-

538
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Seth: Yes.

539
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,398
Dan: -used the phrase intimate
collaboration, which I love.

540
00:23:08,398 --> 00:23:09,796
And-

541
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:13,635
and it's -- it paints such a
different picture that -- from

542
00:23:13,635 --> 00:23:16,665
that mindset, paints such a
different picture than ... some

543
00:23:16,665 --> 00:23:19,125
of the software, like, when you
come at it from the software

544
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,000
land, everybody -- all --
software developers, lots of

545
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,556
times, want to ... remove

546
00:23:24,826 --> 00:23:28,425
the human aspects of things,
right? And they build tools to,

547
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:32,145
like, plug things in or project
management tools or, you know,

548
00:23:32,151 --> 00:23:34,000
everybody has stacks of cards to
-- oh, I'm sorry. Everyone

549
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,236
has stacks of

550
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:36,000
cards to get through [chuckles].
And --

551
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Bekah: What do you think he was
here [chuckles]?

552
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Dan: I know.

553
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Bekah: You didn't know there was
a guest [chuckles]?

554
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,796
Dan: He's always ... bothering
me [chuckles].

555
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:42,225
Seth: [Chuckles] Is he, like,
bringing you a drink or

556
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:42,569
something?

557
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,346
Dan: Special guest. Yeah, I
know. He's -- yeah, yeah. He's-

558
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,286
he's -- he brings me my- my- my
Scotch at the, you know, under

559
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:51,316
my desk, the end of the day.
Except, it's ... the middle of

560
00:23:51,316 --> 00:23:55,605
the day. Anyway [chuckles], what
was I saying? So, yes. I think

561
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:58,516
that- I think that's probably
another connection between you

562
00:23:58,546 --> 00:24:03,000
-- the ... your experience
within the entertainment, you

563
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,546
know, i-in

564
00:24:04,546 --> 00:24:09,675
film -- in the film realm is- is
making these connections is such

565
00:24:09,675 --> 00:24:11,865
an important thing. And it's-
it's very important in software

566
00:24:11,865 --> 00:24:14,746
too. But I- I think it gets --
people tend to abstract it away.

567
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,715
People tend to abstract away the
human connection aspect of

568
00:24:17,776 --> 00:24:21,000
anything. And, I feel like work
-- everybody -- all --

569
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,155
we're all

570
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:26,415
doing, and everybody sort of
naturally does at Virtual

571
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,000
Coffee, whether they are
officially doing it or not.

572
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,766
It's -- and I'm seeing

573
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:33,465
other people start to swing this
way too. It's -- lots of people

574
00:24:33,465 --> 00:24:37,141
talk about community these days,
and building communities in your

575
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:40,381
company, and- and things, like,
making connections like that.

576
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:43,800
And I think we're finding out,
like, it's so important to

577
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:46,590
foster those sort of intimate
connections. A-and obviously,

578
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,000
you can go probably too far
[laughs] but, like-

579
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Seth: Sure.

580
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,181
Dan: -remembering that all the
people

581
00:24:51,181 --> 00:24:53,971
are people, right? And everybody
that works on a project is --

582
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:56,490
has their own stake in it. And,
you know, it- it's -- the

583
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,000
project's gonna be better if you
have somebody like that,

584
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,010
have somebody

585
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,971
like you, you know? Fostering
these intimate, you know,

586
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,661
connections and stuff like that.

587
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,510
Seth: Yeah. I mean, that's
exactly right. I mean, and part

588
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:10,381
of that is like, you know, we --
is giving shouts out to people,

589
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,651
shoutouts to people, whatever
you wanna say. Like,

590
00:25:13,651 --> 00:25:16,000
acknowledging people and- and-
and celebrating them. Now you'd

591
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:21,000
mentioned community and ... how
it's kind of becoming more

592
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,711
prevalent in software.

593
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:26,560
And I'm -- to me, that's great.
Cuz that's what it is -- that's

594
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,451
what it's about for me, just in
many ways, is- is friendship,

595
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:39,000
and authenticity, and, you know
... intimate ... you know,

596
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,941
friendships that

597
00:25:39,945 --> 00:25:42,193
are real. That- that like bring
the joy in -- to life and bring-

598
00:25:42,193 --> 00:25:44,441
bring,

599
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,840
you know, bring things to life.
That's what it is for me. And-

600
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,000
and -- so, you know, part of
that is, like, you know, at

601
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,056
work, I like to do shoutouts to

602
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,806
people, and, like, really just
celebrate people, and- and, you

603
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:57,895
know, I'm- I'm a super positive,
you know, I don't wanna have any

604
00:25:57,901 --> 00:25:59,773
conflict. If there is conflict,
I'll deal with it. But like --

605
00:25:59,773 --> 00:26:01,645
and

606
00:26:01,651 --> 00:26:04,645
I've had so many jobs where it's
just, like, not like that at

607
00:26:04,645 --> 00:26:07,000
all. And it's so -- makes me so
anxious and nervous, and I

608
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,455
don't- I don't know

609
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:12,385
how to find my footing, and-
and, like, I just feel like

610
00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:16,000
undervalued and- and- and just
not in the right place. And

611
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,336
so at Uniform,

612
00:26:17,336 --> 00:26:20,425
like, it's the exact opposite.
Like, everybody is super

613
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:25,000
friendly, super laid back, just
very welcoming. And- and a

614
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,096
community, it's

615
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:29,000
like -- culturally at Uniform is
it -- the culture at Uniform

616
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,375
is very ...

617
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:35,000
like, on point. It's great. And
it fits my personality, and

618
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,846
I feel --

619
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:38,000
and, say, from that, I feel
valued and I feel empowered

620
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,026
to do really

621
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:41,000
good work, right? I mean, that's
how it works. You- you-

622
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Bekah: Yeah.

623
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,520
Seth: -appreciate people and

624
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,730
you're- you're- you're a nice
pleasant people to be around.

625
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,550
You're gonna wanna work hard and
collaborate together to do

626
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,000
things as opposed to feeling
like you can't -- you're

627
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,830
walking on thin ice or whatever,
you know?

628
00:26:52,705 --> 00:26:54,130
Bekah: I- I love that. And I
think that one of the things

629
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,555
that

630
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,313
you -- one of the words you
used, au- authenticity, is so

631
00:26:57,313 --> 00:26:59,066
important.

632
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:01,586
Because I think that there are a
number of companies out there

633
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:07,135
that recognize that community
within the company is good and

634
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:10,675
can be really useful, but they
come at it from a n-not an

635
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:14,000
authentic approach. Like, "We're
gonna make this company

636
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,276
a community,"

637
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:18,846
right? And then there's this
forcefulness, like, "We're gonna

638
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:22,145
be a community. Now you have to
go to this fun thing that we're

639
00:27:22,145 --> 00:27:24,000
all doing together," right?
Like-

640
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Seth: Yeah. Sure, sure.

641
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,066
Bekah: -no, I don't wanna do
that ... fun

642
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:33,701
thing all together. There- there
has to be ... that

643
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:38,171
authenticity there that allows
for vulnerability and openness.

644
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:42,191
And, you know, I've also seen a
number of leaders in positions

645
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:48,280
that kind of [silence] I don't
know the right word for this.

646
00:27:48,286 --> 00:27:50,000
They perform authenticity-

647
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Seth: Mm.

648
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,451
Bekah: -so they act in a way
that appears to be

649
00:27:55,451 --> 00:27:57,881
authentic, but, like, the
further --

650
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Seth: Yeah. Whi- which is,
inherently, not authentic.

651
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,006
Yeah [chuckles].

652
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:02,125
Bekah: Yeah! And the further you
get into it, then it- it just

653
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:06,145
like -- then- then the, like,
suspicious radar goes up. Like,

654
00:28:06,236 --> 00:28:10,645
"Uh, I don't know that you're a
person that I can really trust

655
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:14,215
and talk to." And then that
creates more of a divide. And

656
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:16,945
when you have that, when you
don't have somebody who's

657
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,185
authentic or vulnerable or, you
know, even getting back to that,

658
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:22,505
like, intro question of somebody
that you can laugh with, then

659
00:28:22,505 --> 00:28:24,585
you --

660
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:28,096
there's this distance. There's
this guard that you can put up

661
00:28:28,096 --> 00:28:33,375
or that you might put up that
makes it harder for you to be

662
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:37,155
effective at your job or to
communicate with other people,

663
00:28:37,155 --> 00:28:41,000
because there's always this,
like, leeriness about where you

664
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,885
stand in

665
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:48,685
that, you know, relationship. Or
in that collaboration or- or

666
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,655
whatever it is. So I think that,
you know, having someone

667
00:28:51,655 --> 00:28:57,000
authentic leading a team is so
important in-

668
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Seth: Yeah.

669
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,905
Bekah: -forming those bonds that
you need for your company.

670
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,580
Seth: Totally. We just
implemented this thing called

671
00:29:03,586 --> 00:29:08,441
15Five. It's a online web
service that allows for, like,

672
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:12,000
it manages one on ones, it
manages, like, high fives,

673
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,151
you can give,

674
00:29:13,181 --> 00:29:16,000
you know- you know, internal
high fives. And it- and it

675
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,681
really ...

676
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:21,520
opens -- it fosters that kind of
community and that kind of

677
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,605
culture. And so that's why my-
my company is series a funded

678
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:28,360
startups. They're just beginning
to, like, hiring, work on

679
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,115
culture,

680
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:32,816
and work on all that stuff that
they, in the beginning, you

681
00:29:32,816 --> 00:29:34,000
don't do that cuz you're
building a product to get the

682
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,155
funding. But

683
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:36,523
now that they have the funding,
all these things are locking

684
00:29:36,523 --> 00:29:37,885
into

685
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:41,336
place, and that -- it's just
such a relief to- to know that

686
00:29:41,336 --> 00:29:44,000
that's there, and it, like, to
not walk into -- to walk into

687
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,546
work and not

688
00:29:44,546 --> 00:29:48,059
be anxious, and not be nervous,
you know? I'm not dreading,

689
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:51,572
like,

690
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:53,972
"How am I gonna make this
JavaScript thing happen

691
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:55,021
[laughs]?"

692
00:29:56,553 --> 00:29:57,992
You know what I mean? Like, how
am I gonna do this? Like, I

693
00:29:57,992 --> 00:29:59,000
should kn- and then start
beating myself up. "I should

694
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,212
know this

695
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:03,000
already. I've been doing this
for this long," and- and,

696
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,053
anyway, a-a-and --

697
00:30:04,712 --> 00:30:07,000
and that's just kinda highlight
the importance of the --

698
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,593
of community.

699
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:10,383
And I will say that, you know,
when I discovered Virtual Coffee

700
00:30:10,383 --> 00:30:14,103
-- I don't even remember how I
discovered it. I think it was

701
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,073
through Drew Clements somehow. I
don't remember --

702
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,988
Bekah: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I
think that's true.

703
00:30:18,272 --> 00:30:22,323
Seth: I forget. I somehow found
... him, and then found Virtual

704
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:24,153
Coffee. And it was like a huge
breath of fresh air.

705
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:25,547
Bekah: He was doing Protege. So,
was it through Protege? I mean

706
00:30:25,547 --> 00:30:26,806
--

707
00:30:26,853 --> 00:30:28,173
Seth: Yeah, it was probably
through that. I was probably

708
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:31,000
looking thru- for jobs, and I
saw him through Protege, and

709
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,373
then I saw

710
00:30:32,377 --> 00:30:34,728
Virtual Coffee through him. And
then I ended up working on

711
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:39,018
Protege through that too, which
was interesting. But i-i-it was

712
00:30:39,018 --> 00:30:42,000
such a -- the -- when I
discovered Virtual Coffee, it

713
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,048
was a ... godsend,

714
00:30:45,528 --> 00:30:48,317
essentially. Cuz we were in the
middle of pan- I was in the

715
00:30:48,317 --> 00:30:49,817
middle of the pandemic, right?
We were all in the middle of the

716
00:30:49,817 --> 00:30:53,688
pandemic. I had moved out to the
mountains, which I like my -- I

717
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:55,157
like being out in the mountains,
but I also like people, you

718
00:30:55,157 --> 00:30:56,626
know?

719
00:30:57,077 --> 00:31:01,000
And I just -- it was -- it
saved- it saved me in many ways.

720
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,758
Cuz it

721
00:31:01,758 --> 00:31:04,307
helped me keep going as a
developer, and it helped me

722
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:08,087
develop friendships, and- and
it's, you know, and that's,

723
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:10,097
that's it. That's community,
right? That's what community

724
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:16,000
does. It- it- it kinda -- it
gives -- it- it- it -- a lot

725
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,667
of things

726
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:20,417
start to bloom, right? All the
different -- these beautiful

727
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:22,000
things start blooming from it.
And we can see it every day

728
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,508
on our- on

729
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:27,000
our Slack team is it -- like,
people are doing this and doing

730
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,633
that. And

731
00:31:27,633 --> 00:31:29,373
there's support here, there's
support there. And then you got

732
00:31:29,373 --> 00:31:32,673
in person meetups, and it just
-- and that's just a beautiful

733
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:35,492
thing about the Virtual Coffee,
I think. And- and I'm sure you

734
00:31:35,492 --> 00:31:37,000
never even expected that when
you started it, you know?

735
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,012
You ... might-

736
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,012
Bekah: [Chuckles] Nope.

737
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:40,000
Seth: -have thought something
like- like- like it, but ...

738
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,732
yeah. It just- it just,

739
00:31:41,792 --> 00:31:44,883
all of us coming together to
support each other really makes

740
00:31:44,913 --> 00:31:47,343
the -- makes the indus- makes
our lives better, but it makes

741
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:48,482
the industry better, I think.

742
00:31:50,252 --> 00:31:53,792
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. I- I
think that any opportunity that

743
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:56,732
you have for that close
collaboration with people,

744
00:31:57,182 --> 00:32:02,000
openness with other people can
be ... just a -- I don't know.

745
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,702
I mean,

746
00:32:02,702 --> 00:32:05,163
yeah, you can be more productive
that way, but that's just a

747
00:32:05,163 --> 00:32:08,373
really beautiful part of the
human experience. And I think

748
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:13,893
that we often don't think about
that, the -- we -- it's

749
00:32:13,893 --> 00:32:15,000
complicated, right? Because we
want our jobs-

750
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Seth: Mm.

751
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,952
Bekah: -to stop. We don't want
them to go on

752
00:32:16,952 --> 00:32:21,153
all the time and to feel like we
can never leave our computers,

753
00:32:21,153 --> 00:32:25,863
but there's something to be said
for finding time to pause and

754
00:32:25,867 --> 00:32:29,000
make meaningful ...
relationships with the people

755
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
who are on your team.

756
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Seth: Yeah.

757
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Bekah: That- that helps you to
be better, everybody to be

758
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,573
better at

759
00:32:36,573 --> 00:32:39,603
their jobs. But, you know,
ultimately we are not our jobs.

760
00:32:39,603 --> 00:32:41,000
We are human beings.

761
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Seth: Yep.

762
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,923
Bekah: And so, what helps us to
become better at

763
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:48,992
that or to grow or to become the
people that we want to be? Our

764
00:32:48,992 --> 00:32:51,000
jobs take up a big portion of
our lives. So finding something

765
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
that allows you to continue on
that path of being the person

766
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
that you want to be, and to be
able-

767
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Seth: Yes.

768
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,893
Bekah: -to do the things that
you wanna do

769
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,442
outside of work is really
important.

770
00:33:02,538 --> 00:33:05,208
Seth: Yep, 100%. That was --
that's

771
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:09,347
basically what my 20 year old
self was saying to myself

772
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:11,000
[chuckles]. He was just like,
"Seth, there's gotta be more."

773
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,827
Like, "I- I- I need something

774
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:17,778
meaningful. I- I need something
that's just not like ... just a

775
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:21,000
typical middle of the road," you
know? And ... and I'm-

776
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,948
I'm not saying

777
00:33:21,948 --> 00:33:26,147
this for everybody, but it's
pursuing -- I've always pursued

778
00:33:26,147 --> 00:33:28,000
my dreams, and my heart, and-
and- and for good, you know,

779
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,298
for better or

780
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:33,000
for worse. And -- but it's
gotten me this far, right? It's

781
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,978
gotten me ...

782
00:33:35,478 --> 00:33:39,678
in a career that I love, being
with my family every day, well

783
00:33:39,678 --> 00:33:42,190
paid, well respected, and
creative. And like you said,

784
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,702
it's not my

785
00:33:45,002 --> 00:33:49,000
life. My life is outside of work
... in many ways. So ...

786
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,363
you know?

787
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:54,512
Yeah, I feel like I won the
lottery, essentially, in some

788
00:33:54,512 --> 00:33:55,592
ways.

789
00:33:56,012 --> 00:33:59,000
But I got -- but I spent a lot
of money on lottery tickets

790
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,163
[all laugh].

791
00:34:02,163 --> 00:34:04,303
And went through a lot to get
here. But --

792
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:08,237
Bekah: And it's all part of the
journey, right? I mean, I- I

793
00:34:08,237 --> 00:34:12,108
certainly never -- if five and a
half years ago, if you would've

794
00:34:12,347 --> 00:34:16,097
asked me where I expected to be,
it certainly was not here.

795
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:16,728
Seth: Yeah.

796
00:34:16,728 --> 00:34:19,000
Bekah: There- there was a lot
that went into this journey

797
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,027
and a lot of,

798
00:34:20,027 --> 00:34:23,000
like, really hard things to
navigate. But, you know-

799
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,297
Seth: Yes.

800
00:34:23,297 --> 00:34:26,000
Bekah: -I wouldn't take any of
those hard things back because

801
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,228
it shaped me

802
00:34:27,228 --> 00:34:32,222
into the person I am, and I'm-
I'm happy with who I am right

803
00:34:32,222 --> 00:34:34,563
now, probably more than I ever
have been in my life. And-

804
00:34:35,177 --> 00:34:35,418
Seth: For sure. Yep.

805
00:34:35,822 --> 00:34:38,163
Bekah: -you know, all of those
circumstances and all of the

806
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:42,422
people that I've met, especially
in the last three years, have

807
00:34:42,427 --> 00:34:45,422
been on that journey with me and
allowed me to, you know, kind of

808
00:34:45,572 --> 00:34:49,414
em- embrace this- this Bekah
that ... I am right now.

809
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:51,478
Seth: Yeah. Yeah. That's a good
place to be.

810
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:56,123
Bekah: So, okay. So as you're
going through this, you have

811
00:34:56,123 --> 00:35:01,000
mentioned a couple of times. The
-- you had some experiences

812
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,643
with other

813
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:04,943
companies that weren't so great,
you went through some difficult

814
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:06,547
interviewing experiences, and
now you're- you're at this

815
00:35:06,547 --> 00:35:08,151
really

816
00:35:08,152 --> 00:35:12,862
great place. But I wonder if you
could give yourself some advice,

817
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:16,163
looking back now, so when you
were going through these hard

818
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:21,023
experiences. What would you tell
yourself to kind of give you

819
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:23,483
that hope that you needed to
make it to this point?

820
00:35:24,983 --> 00:35:26,483
Seth: Yeah. I would just say, I
mean, off the top of my head

821
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:27,983
that,

822
00:35:27,983 --> 00:35:31,432
like ... rejection's part of the
process, and perseverance is

823
00:35:31,432 --> 00:35:34,881
key,

824
00:35:36,262 --> 00:35:42,000
and just ... it's really hard to
do this. But most of the

825
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,862
time, things

826
00:35:42,862 --> 00:35:45,427
aren't personal ... right? It's
just ... in terms of

827
00:35:45,427 --> 00:35:47,992
interviewing,

828
00:35:48,052 --> 00:35:50,213
it's just, you wanna good fit or
you bomb the interview or

829
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:53,753
whatever. But to, like, separate
your identity from that, and

830
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:58,222
separate your ... how you feel
about yourself and stuff, it's

831
00:35:58,228 --> 00:36:00,563
really hard when you need money,
you need a job, and you have a

832
00:36:00,563 --> 00:36:03,742
family and stuff. You're super
stressed about it, and- and then

833
00:36:03,748 --> 00:36:07,733
you gotta go do more interviews
and stuff. But- but yeah,

834
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:11,603
like, don't be hard on yourself,
like, don't -- just trust -- I

835
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:15,000
mean, this is a big part of my
life. This is ... trust the

836
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,913
process, right?

837
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:21,233
Whether that be any films that I
produce or all the day in and

838
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:24,893
day out of what I'm doing for my
work, or even my family, it's

839
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:28,612
just like, just do the work
that's ahead of you for the day,

840
00:36:29,092 --> 00:36:32,572
clock out, enjoy your life, go
back the next day, and do the

841
00:36:32,572 --> 00:36:34,000
work that's ahead of you. And
just trust that that's the

842
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,913
process and

843
00:36:34,913 --> 00:36:40,253
you will eventually get
somewhere. And then I also am

844
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:43,000
a big adver- I'm a big advocate
in advocating for myself

845
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,632
[chuckles], but [cough]

846
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:53,152
I'm a big believer in ... like,
standing up for yourself,

847
00:36:53,362 --> 00:36:57,742
believing in yourself, knowing
what you want, like, going to

848
00:36:57,742 --> 00:37:02,213
get it. And that's not in, like
a greed, like, you know, a way

849
00:37:02,213 --> 00:37:04,523
of just like, "I wanna do this.
I'm gonna work really hard

850
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:09,427
to do this thing, whatever that
is." And so, like, believing

851
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:15,637
yourself, you know, extending
grace to yourself ... 100%

852
00:37:15,637 --> 00:37:19,418
find people -- find your people
who can help you, AKA

853
00:37:19,418 --> 00:37:25,000
Virtual Coffee [chuckles]. So
yeah, I think- I think is off

854
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,447
the top of my

855
00:37:25,447 --> 00:37:29,438
head, those would be some things
I would say to myself. I

856
00:37:29,438 --> 00:37:33,600
would also be ... when you have
a community, you can talk

857
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,237
a- you can

858
00:37:34,237 --> 00:37:37,628
run red flags by people. You can
say, "Hey, is this a red flag?"

859
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:39,000
Or, you know, and if- if
someone's mistreating you,

860
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,418
stand up for

861
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:43,777
yourself. I know that's not -- I
know that's easy for me to say,

862
00:37:44,197 --> 00:37:49,927
for who I am, but not everybody
can do that. But -- and I'm just

863
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:54,000
happened to be comfortable with
... discomfort, I guess

864
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,697
you could

865
00:37:54,697 --> 00:38:01,538
say. So like, if- if someone's
treating me bad, I'm gonna ...

866
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:05,000
stand up for myself. And try not
to be a jerk about it.

867
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,068
Try not to be

868
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:10,117
combative, but ... just believe
in myself and- and know what's

869
00:38:10,117 --> 00:38:13,717
right and what's wrong in a
situation. But, I mean, you

870
00:38:13,722 --> 00:38:16,000
guys know it's so hard to --
when you're navigating

871
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,878
interviews. It-

872
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:22,987
it's like soul sucking. It's-
it's -- it sucks.

873
00:38:24,577 --> 00:38:27,577
Bekah: Yeah. I remember — I
think it was last summer,

874
00:38:27,577 --> 00:38:30,458
actually, at this time — I was
interviewing with two companies

875
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:35,108
and I had heard people say that
the interview process was soul

876
00:38:35,108 --> 00:38:37,748
crushing. And I was like, "Eh,
there's no way it's soul

877
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:40,000
crushing." [Seth laughs] And
then I was invited to apply to

878
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,688
two of these

879
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:43,000
positions and it was still soul
crushing. I'm like-

880
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Seth: Mm.

881
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,873
Bekah: "This is ... the worst."

882
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:45,932
Seth: I know.

883
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:49,000
Bekah: "I never want to do this,
ever again."

884
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Seth: Yeah.

885
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,882
Bekah: And it is. I mean, it
just

886
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:55,000
requires so much ... out of you
in- in a number of

887
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,552
different ways. And-

888
00:38:56,552 --> 00:38:56,552
Seth: Mm.

889
00:38:56,552 --> 00:39:00,000
Bekah: -just kind of is ... I
don't know, puts you through

890
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,592
this furnace. And

891
00:39:01,802 --> 00:39:04,600
how you come out of that, it can
be, you know, you- you

892
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,313
might be very

893
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:11,000
burnt or, you know, maybe you
come out a diamond. I fe- I

894
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,193
felt like that was really cheesy
[laughs].

895
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,047
Dan: Yeah. That wouldn't -- that
was a little rough [laughs].

896
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:24,000
Bekah: I don't know. Sorry.
Sorry for the bad- [chuckles]

897
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,603
the bad metaphor. But

898
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:31,822
the- but the point is, kind of
like what you were saying, Seth,

899
00:39:31,822 --> 00:39:36,592
this idea of you -- don't take
it personally, and think about

900
00:39:36,592 --> 00:39:40,000
it, too, as part of that
journey, right? I like to think

901
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,333
of the hero's

902
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:45,413
journey, and we're all the hero
in our own story. And- and what

903
00:39:45,443 --> 00:39:48,000
the hero goes through, right?
And the hero -- in- in the

904
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,402
mythological structure of the

905
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:52,972
hero, first of all, there are
many, many challenges that the

906
00:39:52,972 --> 00:39:56,273
hero has to navigate. And that
defines the trajectory of the

907
00:39:56,273 --> 00:40:00,157
journey. But also the hero never
does it by themselves. There's

908
00:40:00,157 --> 00:40:02,452
always some type of mentor.
There are allies that they have.

909
00:40:02,452 --> 00:40:04,747
There

910
00:40:04,748 --> 00:40:07,357
are resources or training or
different things that enable

911
00:40:07,357 --> 00:40:09,966
them

912
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:15,023
to continue to move forward. And
in that way, you know, we can

913
00:40:15,023 --> 00:40:18,563
continue to push forward, but
recognizing that we're not on

914
00:40:18,563 --> 00:40:22,012
this journey alone. There are
other people that are there with

915
00:40:22,012 --> 00:40:26,512
us to support us through those
tough times. And when things do

916
00:40:26,512 --> 00:40:30,600
get tough, then- then rather
than, you- you know, pull away

917
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,362
or try

918
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,147
and do it on your own, leaning
on some of those people or

919
00:40:33,147 --> 00:40:34,932
finding

920
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:38,893
your allies or mentors or
whatever, can be the difference

921
00:40:38,893 --> 00:40:43,273
between being stuck in your
journey and continuing forward.

922
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:47,572
Seth: Mm. Yeah. That's a great
point.

923
00:40:49,222 --> 00:40:53,543
Bekah: So ... your job, you are
the technical product owner, and

924
00:40:53,543 --> 00:40:57,362
I'm just kind of circling back a
little bit because I have never

925
00:40:57,713 --> 00:41:01,000
heard of anyone being a
technical product owner before.

926
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,532
So just to

927
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:07,643
kind of get a better sense of
what you're doing, can you talk

928
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:11,932
us through, like, maybe one of
the projects that you're working

929
00:41:11,932 --> 00:41:15,000
on or the things that you do
find really interesting about

930
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,443
that work?

931
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:21,302
Seth: Sure. Yeah, I think it's
-- it could be even considered

932
00:41:21,572 --> 00:41:25,773
a product manager, right? Not a
project manager, but a product

933
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:31,233
manager. So it's- it's an Agile
term, 'product owner'. And it

934
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:34,160
is basically ... I mean, again,
it's the creative producer of-

935
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,087
of

936
00:41:37,088 --> 00:41:41,347
software or whatever, cuz it's-
it's communicating with all the

937
00:41:41,347 --> 00:41:44,498
stakeholders, figuring out what
you need, figuring out the

938
00:41:44,498 --> 00:41:49,057
direction of the product, what's
the roadmap, what are

939
00:41:49,057 --> 00:41:54,757
the priorities, you know,
breaking all that s- all that

940
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:59,000
down into tickets, communicating
all that to tech -- to --

941
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,398
communicating all those

942
00:42:00,398 --> 00:42:03,000
needs to developers, right?
That's a special tran-

943
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,728
transition there.

944
00:42:04,387 --> 00:42:08,858
And also, working with multiple
stakeholders. So- so it's very

945
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:11,500
-- it's- it's a -- it's an Agile
term. It could also be

946
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,427
pro- product

947
00:42:12,427 --> 00:42:16,717
manager ... I guess, maybe PM or
whatever. But the technical side

948
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:21,697
of it is because I was a
front-end developer. And I was

949
00:42:21,697 --> 00:42:23,032
originally hired to be a
front-end developer in the

950
00:42:23,032 --> 00:42:24,367
trenches

951
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:29,302
building out Jamstack sites, and
when this transition came, I was

952
00:42:29,302 --> 00:42:32,000
like, "Okay, I can see that." I
was like, "But I still, like,

953
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,152
have all this

954
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:35,922
technical knowledge." And my
CTO's, the one that said it, he

955
00:42:35,922 --> 00:42:37,000
was like, "We look at you more
like a technical product owner."

956
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,643
And I was

957
00:42:37,648 --> 00:42:40,643
like, "Great. Let's do it," you
know? And what that means is I

958
00:42:40,648 --> 00:42:44,123
just understand what's happening
on the development side, I

959
00:42:44,123 --> 00:42:48,202
understand what it takes to do a
feature or understand what's

960
00:42:48,202 --> 00:42:51,322
happening. I'm just not the one
doing it. And if -- and I -- but

961
00:42:51,322 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm still, like, spinning up,
you know, I'm still doing

962
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,952
front-end stuff

963
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:58,342
where I'm like, you know, I'm
doing all the repo stuff and

964
00:42:58,347 --> 00:43:00,592
doing the README, and going
through all the steps of the

965
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:03,023
README, and installing NPM
packages, and all that kind of

966
00:43:03,023 --> 00:43:08,092
stuff. So I'm still in the
technical area. I'm just not a

967
00:43:08,092 --> 00:43:13,193
front-end developer like I used
to be. And, you know, what I

968
00:43:13,193 --> 00:43:16,000
love about it is the different
communi- the different groups

969
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,987
I work

970
00:43:16,987 --> 00:43:20,000
with. Like, I get to hang out
with de- with designers and

971
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,737
talk about UX

972
00:43:20,737 --> 00:43:26,318
and UI. I get to review designs,
I get to offer tweaks and, you

973
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:28,600
know, and I get to think of it
as a developer. Cuz I know,

974
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,047
"Oh, this

975
00:43:29,047 --> 00:43:32,000
image is huge. We, you know, how
-- let's figure out what

976
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,648
image size

977
00:43:32,648 --> 00:43:35,603
we need," or whatever that comes
up from the developer mindset

978
00:43:35,603 --> 00:43:38,273
when talking to designers. And
then I get to talk to, like,

979
00:43:38,273 --> 00:43:41,932
marketers and that -- that's a
little bit out- outside of my

980
00:43:41,963 --> 00:43:45,143
comfort zone, but I'm a people
person. So I can talk to them

981
00:43:45,503 --> 00:43:48,000
and ask what they need, and
what, you know, like, "What-

982
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,922
what do you-

983
00:43:49,012 --> 00:43:50,000
what do you need to demo?" Like,
"What are you trying to

984
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,043
... what," -- like,

985
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:54,713
the first thing I did when I got
to this job was I talked to --

986
00:43:54,713 --> 00:43:58,000
like, I had like 20 meetings or
something and, like, in no

987
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,077
time at all.

988
00:43:59,077 --> 00:44:01,208
And I was talking to everybody
about what are the pain points

989
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:04,088
of- of the current demo -- the
current demo ecosystem. Like,

990
00:44:04,447 --> 00:44:08,257
"You're taking this product
Uniform's platform and you're

991
00:44:08,257 --> 00:44:11,000
demoing it to people. Wh-what-
what are you missing? Like,

992
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,768
what are

993
00:44:11,773 --> 00:44:15,398
they asking for? What do you
wanna see?" And- and what it

994
00:44:15,398 --> 00:44:16,388
ended up being was, like, "Well,
we got like three or four

995
00:44:16,388 --> 00:44:17,378
different

996
00:44:17,378 --> 00:44:20,648
demos that are all doing random
things, and we need all those

997
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:24,338
features and functionalities in-
into consolidated

998
00:44:25,057 --> 00:44:30,000
redesigned ... redeveloped
demos," you know? So- so I get

999
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,777
to -- and-

1000
00:44:31,782 --> 00:44:34,000
and I- I really do look at it
as, like, basically making

1001
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,137
client Jamstack

1002
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:39,097
sites. My- my client just
happens to be my- my coworkers-

1003
00:44:39,097 --> 00:44:39,532
Bekah: Yeah.

1004
00:44:39,532 --> 00:44:42,000
Seth: -right? So they're asking
me for stuff, and I'm saying,

1005
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,833
"Well, I- I

1006
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:46,103
can or can't do that this
sprint," or, "Okay, cool. I'll

1007
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:47,527
work that in." And then I'm
going over to tech lead and

1008
00:44:47,527 --> 00:44:48,951
saying,

1009
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:51,000
"Hey, we need to do this." And
he goes, "Okay, cool. We'll

1010
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,742
-- I'll-

1011
00:44:51,802 --> 00:44:55,373
I'll work up the techs of -- the
tech side of that." And we'll-

1012
00:44:55,373 --> 00:44:56,527
we'll pass the issues down to
the developers, and then

1013
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,681
developers

1014
00:44:57,682 --> 00:44:59,242
deliver it to me. And I do user
assurance testing where I'm

1015
00:44:59,242 --> 00:45:00,802
like,

1016
00:45:00,802 --> 00:45:02,700
"Okay, that's what I wanted.
That's what we- what we need,"

1017
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,777
and -- or

1018
00:45:03,777 --> 00:45:07,407
I'll say, "Hey, this responsive,
you know, layout is wrong," or,

1019
00:45:07,648 --> 00:45:10,858
"Hey, you know, we need to do
this different." And so, I like

1020
00:45:10,862 --> 00:45:13,500
the idea -- or I like the -- my-
my job in the sense that I

1021
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,097
get to talk

1022
00:45:14,097 --> 00:45:16,557
to all these different people,
right? When I was a front-end

1023
00:45:16,557 --> 00:45:18,222
developer, it was me, by myself,
banging my head against the

1024
00:45:18,222 --> 00:45:19,887
wall,

1025
00:45:20,097 --> 00:45:22,000
reading tutorials [chuckles].
And, you know, then I would-

1026
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,117
then I would p-ping

1027
00:45:24,117 --> 00:45:27,027
Virtual Coffee people and have,
you know, different co-working

1028
00:45:27,027 --> 00:45:30,728
sessions and stuff. But most of
the time it was me, by myself.

1029
00:45:30,757 --> 00:45:34,027
And so I love that part of it. I
love that I get to ...

1030
00:45:34,027 --> 00:45:37,297
understand

1031
00:45:37,327 --> 00:45:38,902
these big features, and
understand how to make them

1032
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,477
happen, but I

1033
00:45:40,478 --> 00:45:45,608
don't have to be the one coding
it. I really like that. And

1034
00:45:45,612 --> 00:45:47,259
that's just because it was, like
I said before, it was -- it

1035
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:48,906
could

1036
00:45:48,907 --> 00:45:51,187
be super difficult to solve
these technical problems. And I

1037
00:45:51,187 --> 00:45:53,467
like

1038
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:58,057
being the one who's guiding it,
encouraging, getting people

1039
00:45:58,057 --> 00:46:03,623
stoked, updating our progress,
you know? Knowing what they

1040
00:46:03,623 --> 00:46:05,000
accomplished, like, "Man, you
guys did a- a really hard

1041
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,413
feature. Good

1042
00:46:06,413 --> 00:46:08,333
job," you know? And- and- and
the way I communicate my tickets

1043
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:10,253
to

1044
00:46:10,253 --> 00:46:11,692
them, my get up issues to them,
they know that I know that

1045
00:46:11,692 --> 00:46:13,131
stuff.

1046
00:46:13,822 --> 00:46:15,802
You know what I mean? Cuz I'm
able to be like, "Hey, can you-

1047
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:18,983
can you change this Tailwind
class to so and so, instead of

1048
00:46:18,983 --> 00:46:21,000
so and so, because the
whatever," you know? So it's

1049
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
like I'm getting this --

1050
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,693
to be developer adjacent. And
so- so a product owner really

1051
00:46:26,697 --> 00:46:31,000
just sees the product from ...
it- it- it takes everything in,

1052
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,213
it plans the

1053
00:46:32,213 --> 00:46:35,902
whole thing out, and then it,
like, releases stuff out to the

1054
00:46:35,902 --> 00:46:39,563
client. And then it takes
feedback, puts that into the

1055
00:46:39,623 --> 00:46:42,152
roadmap, and keeps the cycle
going.

1056
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:46,838
Bekah: Yeah. I really love that.
Because, well, for a number of

1057
00:46:46,842 --> 00:46:49,807
reasons. But there are so many
people that are coming into tech

1058
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,000
right now that it's
oversaturated with people

1059
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,407
looking for junior

1060
00:46:53,407 --> 00:46:58,027
positions. But what you've done
is you've leveraged all of your

1061
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,875
non-technical skills or
non-coding skills, and

1062
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:03,352
transferred

1063
00:47:03,652 --> 00:47:08,242
them over into a job that makes
you really good at that job.

1064
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:12,563
And so I think that, you know,
sometimes people are developers,

1065
00:47:12,568 --> 00:47:16,463
and- and they move over into
different positions that are

1066
00:47:16,702 --> 00:47:17,000
management and-

1067
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Seth: Mm-hmm.

1068
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,813
Bekah: -maybe they're not well
suited for those. They're

1069
00:47:20,813 --> 00:47:21,000
really good-

1070
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Seth: Mm-hmm.

1071
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,983
Bekah: -at being a developer.
But also, it's -- that's not the

1072
00:47:24,983 --> 00:47:29,003
only job that you can have. If
you've gone to a bootcamp or if

1073
00:47:29,003 --> 00:47:31,913
you've taught yourself how to
code or if you have a CS degree,

1074
00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:36,052
whatever, you know, there are
these tech adjacent jobs that

1075
00:47:36,052 --> 00:47:40,432
require you to have this
knowledge and understanding, but

1076
00:47:40,438 --> 00:47:45,983
also, give you space to bring
all of the past history that you

1077
00:47:45,983 --> 00:47:46,000
have doing-

1078
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Seth: Mm-hmm.

1079
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Bekah: -production -- producing
stuff, and make you really --

1080
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,487
give you the

1081
00:47:52,487 --> 00:47:55,577
ability to really excel at what
you're doing. And I think that

1082
00:47:55,788 --> 00:47:59,000
-- I'm glad that you're here
talking about that. Because I

1083
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,387
think that --

1084
00:47:59,807 --> 00:48:02,208
it would be great to have more
people talking about that. And-

1085
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:02,208
Seth: Mm-hmm.

1086
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:05,300
Bekah: -getting more people in
positions like you are in

1087
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,858
enabling those

1088
00:48:06,862 --> 00:48:11,568
intimate collaborations to
happen. So more people feel

1089
00:48:11,568 --> 00:48:13,098
supported in tech because we
also hear so many stories at

1090
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:14,628
Virtual

1091
00:48:14,628 --> 00:48:17,177
Coffee of people who are in
terrible jobs [chuckles].

1092
00:48:17,813 --> 00:48:18,413
Seth: Yes.

1093
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:23,858
Bekah: And this- this -- having
more people doing what you're

1094
00:48:23,858 --> 00:48:29,347
doing, I think, helps to create
tech -- create a much more

1095
00:48:29,347 --> 00:48:30,668
welcoming tech community.

1096
00:48:31,793 --> 00:48:34,000
Seth: Yeah. I-I-I appreciate you
saying that. I mean, like-

1097
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,672
li-like I

1098
00:48:34,672 --> 00:48:36,022
said, it's -- I mean, really, by
the- by the grace of God,

1099
00:48:36,022 --> 00:48:37,372
honestly,

1100
00:48:37,378 --> 00:48:40,000
that it even happened. Cuz I
wasn't -- while I was interested

1101
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,943
in it and

1102
00:48:40,943 --> 00:48:44,600
I was- I was ... I- I could say
that would be cool to do.

1103
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,202
I didn't

1104
00:48:45,202 --> 00:48:47,543
really plan it. It just kinda
happened. And at first I was

1105
00:48:47,543 --> 00:48:50,302
like, "What do you mean I'm not
gonna be coding out this stuff?

1106
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,762
I thought you hired me as an
engineer." And it just -- it was

1107
00:48:52,762 --> 00:48:55,500
just a classic start-up, "Well,
now we now -- we need this.

1108
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,512
And we have

1109
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:59,592
a marketing engineering team,
which handles the website, our

1110
00:48:59,592 --> 00:49:05,000
integrations handles demos, so
we want you to just -- we,"

1111
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:05,992
like, what

1112
00:49:05,998 --> 00:49:07,555
they said -- this one thing they
said to me, they said, you know,

1113
00:49:07,555 --> 00:49:09,112
"The

1114
00:49:09,202 --> 00:49:12,713
technical skills you have, a lot
of people have. But not many

1115
00:49:12,713 --> 00:49:14,737
people have the other skills you
have." And I was like,

1116
00:49:14,737 --> 00:49:16,761
"Awesome."

1117
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:20,512
Like, that's- that's why I
believe in developing those kind

1118
00:49:20,512 --> 00:49:25,000
of skills. I call 'em relational
skills. But in- in this -- I

1119
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,492
find it a

1120
00:49:25,492 --> 00:49:28,492
little bit easier to develop
relational skills than tech

1121
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:32,000
skills sometimes. And I also
find it more natural to have-

1122
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,483
have -- to be

1123
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:37,538
organizational. Seeing the big
picture planning. But I happen

1124
00:49:37,538 --> 00:49:40,867
to have a tech background. So it
helps me understand how to talk

1125
00:49:40,867 --> 00:49:45,757
to designers, and developers,
and stuff. So, yeah. I just feel

1126
00:49:45,757 --> 00:49:47,962
like -- I -- like, after all
these years of like wandering

1127
00:49:47,962 --> 00:49:50,167
around,

1128
00:49:50,168 --> 00:49:51,817
and trying to figure it out, and
like, sacrificing, and not

1129
00:49:51,817 --> 00:49:53,466
giving

1130
00:49:53,472 --> 00:49:55,719
up, and like, just pushing,
pushing, pushing, I'm- I'm in

1131
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:57,966
the

1132
00:49:57,967 --> 00:50:01,387
most comfortable place I've been
in the -- and I'm -- I feel the

1133
00:50:01,387 --> 00:50:08,018
happiest I've been in my career.
Maybe ever. And so that's

1134
00:50:08,018 --> 00:50:11,257
just such a blessing. I'm very
thankful for that. And I really

1135
00:50:11,347 --> 00:50:13,000
don't know how much control I
had over it. I think it just

1136
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,068
... I- I

1137
00:50:15,072 --> 00:50:18,097
don't know. You could say, you
know, that -- well, if you put

1138
00:50:18,097 --> 00:50:20,137
yourself out there, things will
happen or whatever. There's a

1139
00:50:20,137 --> 00:50:22,148
lot of philosophies you could --
and beliefs you could say. But

1140
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:25,327
really, to me, it's just- it's
just a natural progression that-

1141
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:29,257
that happened. And I was able to
see what it was, and go,

1142
00:50:29,288 --> 00:50:32,000
"Ah, yes. This is it. This is-
this is it. This is it for me."

1143
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,998
And I feel

1144
00:50:33,998 --> 00:50:36,967
like I'm thriving. And I- and
like I said before, I feel

1145
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:42,248
valued. I feel empowered because
of my company. Because I'm

1146
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:46,000
in- I'm in a more comfort zone.
Where before, in

1147
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,947
front-end development,

1148
00:50:46,947 --> 00:50:49,108
there were often times I was out
of my comfort zone.

1149
00:50:50,135 --> 00:50:51,275
Bekah: Yeah, I love that.

1150
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:54,000
Dan: Yeah. So that -- I mean, I
pretty much just wanna wrap

1151
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,014
up here, I

1152
00:50:55,014 --> 00:50:57,864
think. I think this seemed like
a good place to stop in general.

1153
00:50:57,894 --> 00:51:01,434
I- I mean, I personally really
appreciated hearing your

1154
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,582
story. I -- and I- I liked about
hearing about product owners

1155
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:05,724
and,

1156
00:51:05,724 --> 00:51:08,184
you know, I- I love this idea of
the producer, like, the creative

1157
00:51:08,184 --> 00:51:09,000
producer and-

1158
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Seth: Mm.

1159
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,699
Dan: -applying it to- to tech. I
think it's- I think it's

1160
00:51:12,699 --> 00:51:13,000
a fantastic approach. And-

1161
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Seth: Yeah.

1162
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,190
Dan: -probably plenty- plenty

1163
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,369
of people are doing it and not
using that name, you

1164
00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:18,760
know, or not using --

1165
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:19,750
Seth: Exactly. Yeah.

1166
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:24,489
Dan: You know, I- I think that-
that your instincts behind

1167
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:26,980
doing all that is -- are really
spot on. And I think you're

1168
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,869
gonna be really valuable.

1169
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:30,849
Seth: Yeah. I appreciate that,
man.

1170
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:32,884
Dan: I- I think it's really
cool. And I think it's a- I

1171
00:51:32,884 --> 00:51:34,578
think

1172
00:51:34,579 --> 00:51:37,700
it's a very cool skill set and
... I don't know if you wanna

1173
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,090
call it

1174
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:40,500
talent or whatever, but like
[chuckles], just a valuable

1175
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,599
thing for- for

1176
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,909
any company, you know what I
mean? Anybody that's producing

1177
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:45,590
software to have somebody like
that, you know?

1178
00:51:46,445 --> 00:51:47,900
Seth: Yeah. Well, I mean, it's
-- it takes so much to do

1179
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,355
anything,

1180
00:51:49,355 --> 00:51:52,684
right? E-even a basic websites.
It's- it's a lot to wrangle

1181
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:56,434
together and it's a lot to think
about. And it -- so it helps to

1182
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:59,315
have a team of people who have
different ... I guess you could

1183
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:03,574
say skill sets or leanings or
whatever, but -- cuz not

1184
00:52:03,574 --> 00:52:06,364
everybody is gonna be, you know,
a great backend developer, but

1185
00:52:06,364 --> 00:52:08,000
you're gonna need backend
development. So it's just-

1186
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,434
it's just a

1187
00:52:08,434 --> 00:52:11,500
part of the team. I- I look it
-- as a team, as a whole. Just-

1188
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,125
just like

1189
00:52:12,275 --> 00:52:13,715
when I was doing film, like, it
takes a village to make

1190
00:52:13,715 --> 00:52:15,155
something.

1191
00:52:15,664 --> 00:52:17,974
In- in software, in, you know,
web development is the exact

1192
00:52:17,974 --> 00:52:20,284
same

1193
00:52:20,434 --> 00:52:22,000
in- in most cases. But there are
some people out there who

1194
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,324
can just do

1195
00:52:23,324 --> 00:52:26,465
it by themselves and I've always
looked at them in- in amazement.

1196
00:52:26,465 --> 00:52:29,405
But I'm a big believer in just
the team, the collaboration,

1197
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:33,155
someone to bounce ideas off of,
you don't feel alone, the burden

1198
00:52:33,155 --> 00:52:34,894
is shared, you know? All those
things.

1199
00:52:36,815 --> 00:52:39,000
Bekah: Yeah. I love that. Well,
before we wrap up, is

1200
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,985
there any last

1201
00:52:40,985 --> 00:52:44,565
words of wisdom or any projects
that you wanna talk about?

1202
00:52:46,094 --> 00:52:49,655
Seth: Not really on any
projects. I mean, I just -- I

1203
00:52:49,655 --> 00:52:54,034
did have a- a little win, this
week. I had my first release

1204
00:52:54,034 --> 00:52:55,000
ever in- in- in this role-

1205
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

1206
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,364
Seth: -this kind of role. Like,
I was responsible for the --

1207
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,800
everything that comes with the
release. Now, granted it's an

1208
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,000
internal, right? I'm- I'm not
running a product, you know,

1209
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,920
or you --

1210
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,360
we have users. But -- so, it's a
little bit- a little bit less

1211
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,620
pressure, maybe, cuz it's
internal, and you got people who

1212
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,880
are

1213
00:53:10,885 --> 00:53:12,980
forgiving, and you're working to
get it out, and you don't have

1214
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:16,730
users yelling at you on Twitter
or whatever. But ... but no.

1215
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,559
It's no- no particular projects.
Just, you know, I- I just --

1216
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,388
we've

1217
00:53:20,389 --> 00:53:21,619
talked about this a lot in- in
Virtual Coffee, like,

1218
00:53:21,619 --> 00:53:22,849
transferable

1219
00:53:22,849 --> 00:53:26,000
skills I think are really
important. So anybody can --

1220
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,525
I think

1221
00:53:26,525 --> 00:53:29,434
there's a lot of things that
people might know or might be

1222
00:53:29,434 --> 00:53:33,695
good at they don't realize they
could apply, and- and it-

1223
00:53:33,695 --> 00:53:33,699
Bekah: Yes.

1224
00:53:33,699 --> 00:53:36,000
Seth: -could be technical, but
it's m- might be mostly

1225
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,534
relational, you know?

1226
00:53:37,534 --> 00:53:37,534
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

1227
00:53:37,534 --> 00:53:39,500
Seth: Like -- cuz you gotta
remember that we're -- what

1228
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,295
we're doing --

1229
00:53:41,434 --> 00:53:43,339
like, people will hire you based
on your -- how you are as a

1230
00:53:43,339 --> 00:53:45,244
person ...

1231
00:53:46,025 --> 00:53:47,825
more so than your technical
skills. Cuz you can teach techno

1232
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:49,625
--

1233
00:53:50,074 --> 00:53:52,264
technical skills, but you can't
teach someone- teach someone to

1234
00:53:52,264 --> 00:53:54,274
be nice or have integrity or
have good character, you know?

1235
00:53:54,274 --> 00:53:56,284
It's

1236
00:53:56,284 --> 00:53:59,135
a thing you -- people setting.
So I don't know where I'm going

1237
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:00,155
with this, but --

1238
00:54:00,492 --> 00:54:01,974
Bekah: No, I think that's ...
great advice.

1239
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,538
Seth: Just ... keep going
[chuckles]. As an easy- as an

1240
00:54:04,538 --> 00:54:06,517
easy,

1241
00:54:06,668 --> 00:54:09,009
you know, outro, just keep- keep
going and believe in

1242
00:54:09,009 --> 00:54:10,673
yourself. And hopefully, you'll
-- and something will --

1243
00:54:10,673 --> 00:54:12,337
something

1244
00:54:12,344 --> 00:54:13,059
should pop up.

1245
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,179
Bekah: It's so great. Thanks so
much for being here and

1246
00:54:15,179 --> 00:54:15,960
sharing your story with us,
Seth.

1247
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:17,280
Dan: Thanks, Seth.

1248
00:54:17,474 --> 00:54:19,425
Seth: Thank you so much. It's
been a pleasure. I always love

1249
00:54:19,425 --> 00:54:22,800
talking to y'all. So, looking
forward to another time, and

1250
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,610
catch y'all online.

1251
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:24,585
Bekah: Bye.

1252
00:54:24,585 --> 00:54:25,576
Dan: Sounds good. Bye.

1253
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,521
