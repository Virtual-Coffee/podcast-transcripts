coding journey,and they're here

00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:29,528
stories and what they've learned,
and we're here to share it with

00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:32,768
you.Here with me today is my
co-host,Dan.

8
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:35,018
Dan: What up,Beck?How's it going?

9
00:00:35,889 --> 00:00:38,198
Bekah: It is going wonderfully.
How is it going with.

10
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:40,539
Dan: It's going great.Thanks for
asking

11
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:42,723
Bekah: You're welcome.I ask all
the.

12
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:47,598
Dan: Yeah.Yeah.Never,never fails.
Um,yeah.We had another great

13
00:00:47,598 --> 00:00:51,539
episode for y'all.Today.We have
Ram贸n joining us.Ram贸n is a

14
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,378
developer advocate and DevEd
enthusiast.and we had a really

15
00:00:56,378 --> 00:01:00,819
great conversation with him.Um,
he,in his career,has made a point

16
00:01:00,848 --> 00:01:05,228
of helping other people like
learn how to code.Um,seems like

17
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:10,868
his,you know,main,his main happy
place,right?And,uh,Spent a lot of

18
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:14,379
time doing it,and so has a lot of
thoughts on,on the whole process,

19
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:18,519
how to be a better learner,how to
be a better teacher.Uh,a lot of

20
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,968
things.I,I had a,I had a really
fun time talking,to Ram贸n.

21
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,179
Bekah: I really love how
empathetic he is in his approach

22
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,948
and thoughtful,and he spends a
lot of time really reflecting on

23
00:01:28,948 --> 00:01:33,028
the process and his awareness of
other people and where they're

24
00:01:33,028 --> 00:01:39,614
at,and I think that's one of
those things that you.I don't see

25
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:44,894
enough people have that sort of
self-awareness when they're

26
00:01:44,894 --> 00:01:49,394
teaching,and so it's really great
to see and to talk about what

27
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,653
that process looks like and how
we can better support each other

28
00:01:53,653 --> 00:01:55,004
as we learn and grow together.

29
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:59,379
Dan: Yeah,I totally agree.It's a
great point and I,when you were

30
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:01,118
talking about that,it made me
think about some of our other

31
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,108
recent,um,guests and I think,uh,
there is a common through line

32
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,979
of.The,some of the Virtual Coffee
people that have been around for

33
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,829
a while and that are more
experienced in their career.

34
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:16,183
Right.And,um,of that empathy.
Right.Uh,Ryan,one of our guests,

35
00:02:16,243 --> 00:02:19,843
um,I don't know,a few weeks ago,
was,uh,was talking about that a

36
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,243
lot too.Right.And,and it's,I I
think that's one of the things

37
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:24,604
that sets some people apart from
others is,is that,is that.

38
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:29,431
Conscious empathy,you know,uh,
approaching,approaching

39
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:32,670
everything.Uh,and of course,I
mean,we all know it can help your

40
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,610
relationships and everything like
that,but,um,keeping in mind when,

41
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,741
when you're learning,when you're
teaching,when you're,when you're

42
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:42,045
working together,uh,it's,it's
all,um,I don't know.It's,it's

43
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:44,235
such an important and under,I
feel like undervalued and then

44
00:02:44,295 --> 00:02:49,066
under,I don't know what's,what's
an under,you know,not talked

45
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:52,635
about enough I dunno,whatever the
whatever the word that starts

46
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:55,725
with under that means not talked
about enough,uh,But you know what

47
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:58,665
I mean?Like,it's,it's just,it's
one of those things that we,I,I

48
00:02:58,665 --> 00:03:01,635
feel like we try to talk about it
a lot at Virtual Coffee and,um,

49
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:05,086
but it doesn't,I don't see it
come up that often outside of

50
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:08,265
Virtual Coffee.And,uh,well,
hopefully we can try to change

51
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:08,955
that a little bit,you know.

52
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,246
Bekah: Yeah,I like that.What you
just said about c.Conscious

53
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:17,776
empathy.Um,because I think that,
I actually had this conversation

54
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:21,436
on Twitter recently where I told
somebody,empathy is a skill,

55
00:03:21,705 --> 00:03:24,915
right?You're not just born super
empathetic or super not

56
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,455
empathetic.Like May,maybe you
are,but it's something that you

57
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:32,751
can actively work on.To get
better at.And I think that idea

58
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:36,230
of being conscious and having
conscious of it and having those

59
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,441
conversations,that helps you to
grow in that skill and to

60
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:42,980
understand how you can get better
at that.And that's definitely

61
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,191
something that is a common theme
on the podcast and the stuff that

62
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:47,070
we do at Virtual Coffee.

63
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,121
Dan: Yeah.Yeah.Uh,I mean,I
absolutely agree.It's a skill,

64
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:56,881
um,that needs practice and
sometimes it.Uh,you know,it it to

65
00:03:56,881 --> 00:03:59,760
be pointed out to people.Uh,some
people like need some help,you

66
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,371
know,with that and may not even
realize it.Uh,especially because

67
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:06,540
nobody talks about it you know?
Uh,and so I dunno,the more we

68
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,670
talk about it,I think the better
everyone will be.

69
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:12,675
Bekah: Absolutely,and we start
every episode of the podcast,

70
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:15,256
like we start every Virtual
Coffee.We introduce ourselves

71
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:18,675
with our name,where we're from,
what we do,and a random check-in

72
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:30,302
question.We hope you enjoy this
episode.We start every episode of

73
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:33,002
the podcast,like we start every
Virtual Coffee.We introduce

74
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:36,781
ourselves with our name,where
we're from,what we do,and a

75
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:43,112
random check-in question.We hope
you enjoy this episode.Our random

76
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:47,492
check-in question is,would you
rather see10minutes into the

77
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:56,492
future or150years into the
future?My name is Bekah.I am a

78
00:04:56,492 --> 00:05:05,252
person in tech from a small town
in Ohio,and I think I would

79
00:05:05,257 --> 00:05:10,771
rather see10minutes into the
future because.150years seems

80
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:14,612
like a really long time,and I'm
not really sure what I would do

81
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:17,911
with that information.It would
probably send me into some kind

82
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:22,891
of crisis,like what am I gonna do
if this thing is bad,and can I

83
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:28,461
change that?And what happens with
time travel?So10minutes in the

84
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:32,581
future,I can stop myself from
saying something that's like mean

85
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:34,862
or embarrassing.So that seems
useful.

86
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:40,343
Dan: Hmm.Okay.This is a tough
one.All right.Hi,I'm Dan.Uh,I

87
00:05:40,403 --> 00:05:45,113
live in Cleveland and I do
website development on my

88
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:49,463
computer.Um,yeah,I mean,this one
is,there's just too many.I have

89
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:52,163
too many questions.You know what
I mean?It's like,Okay,so you see

90
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:56,244
10minutes in the future,but then
you change something,you know,

91
00:05:57,084 --> 00:06:01,973
and like10minutes into your
future,or like10minutes into,can

92
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:06,144
I know what's happening,you know,
in Ram贸n's house in10minutes

93
00:06:06,204 --> 00:06:09,564
also,even if I'm not there,you
know,like,you know what I mean?

94
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:12,084
Or is it just like your own?

95
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:16,733
Bekah: own space.Like we're,
we've got like three feet of

96
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:19,403
personal space here,so we're
gonna limit it to.

97
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:25,043
Dan: Right.So like I couldn't
like send my son on a bike ride

98
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:29,124
and then,and know that in10
minutes he's gonna like crash and

99
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:32,124
skin his knee or something if
he's out of my sight when that

100
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:32,603
happens.

101
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,494
Bekah: I mean,that seems useful,

102
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:35,983
Dan: That's what I'm saying,like

103
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:39,954
Bekah: But I think,no,no,you
can't do that,sorry.

104
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:43,463
Dan: do.So I can only like see
things that happen to me

105
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:44,994
personally,10minutes in the
future.

106
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:47,713
Bekah: within your site and
hearing range.

107
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:57,548
Dan: Okay.What about,okay,but
then if you change something,see

108
00:06:57,548 --> 00:06:59,649
this is just like,there's no way
you're not ending up in just like

109
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:00,309
a paradox and

110
00:07:00,324 --> 00:07:01,553
Bekah: Okay,Dan,and just see

111
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:02,319
Dan: mentally

112
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:03,954
Bekah: years into the future.

113
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:07,028
Dan: years in the future.Okay.
But I mean,the same question,

114
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:09,798
it's just the paradox,you know,
stuff will happen like slower cuz

115
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:14,874
it's,the feedback loop is slower.
Right.But like,The,the thing that

116
00:07:14,903 --> 00:07:18,923
pops in the,my brain is like,
okay,well I can see that,you

117
00:07:18,923 --> 00:07:22,314
know,X company,apple,what,
whatever the new Apple is,like a

118
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:26,483
huge company.And so buy stocks,
you know,but then if I buy all

119
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:31,644
the stock when they come out,
that will change thing,you know,

120
00:07:31,644 --> 00:07:34,853
that will change the,the,the
trajectory of the company,you

121
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:35,649
Bekah: it,will it

122
00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:39,624
Dan: well,it could,or maybe it's
successful because I bought all

123
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,848
this,you know,this is like,this
is too much.I,uh,

124
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:46,254
Bekah: So you'll just keep your
life the way it is.I think

125
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:46,649
Dan: I

126
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:47,814
Bekah: that's the,

127
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:53,348
Dan: I just,uh,yeah,no,this like
fuels into my indecision loop and

128
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,139
I would just,either way I think
get stuck and end up curling up

129
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:58,509
in a corner,And that would just
be my future.So,

130
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:00,803
Bekah: there's your10minutes.

131
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,848
Dan: there's my10minutes.All
right.That's my answer.

132
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:09,504
Ram贸n: That's totally fair.Uh,hi
everyone.Uh,my name's Ram贸n.I'm

133
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:12,204
originally from Chile,but I'm
living in Vienna,in Austria.I'm a

134
00:08:12,204 --> 00:08:16,463
developer advocate at Suborbital
software systems and,uh,

135
00:08:16,494 --> 00:08:21,293
part-time.And,uh,in my spare time
I do lots of developer education,

136
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:24,863
lots of like working with
emerging devs and just having a

137
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:28,788
good time trying to do my best
to,uh,empower others.And,uh,I'm

138
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:31,038
gonna,I gotta say I'm a little
bit with Dan on this one.Like,I

139
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,099
would love to have a conversation
with the person who,or the entity

140
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:38,869
that's like,cursing me with this
choice,um,because like,on the one

141
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:42,408
hand,10minute,like being a,like
being able to tell what's gonna

142
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:44,599
happen10minutes to,in my
immediate future,to me,like no

143
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:48,504
problem understanding like the
scope of that,but.Um,or,or

144
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:50,964
accepting the scope of that
rather.But I think that would

145
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,874
create so much anxiety in me of
like doubt.Like I already doubt

146
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:57,293
myself a lot.If I already know
where that doubt leads me,I think

147
00:08:57,293 --> 00:09:03,234
that's gonna make it exacerbate
that So,um,so that would make150

148
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:07,854
years in the future.Tempting.
However,I see a,I see a,like a

149
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:11,124
practical a practicality to the
like,well,if I order this meal at

150
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:13,134
a restaurant and it comes in10
minutes,will I enjoy it or not?

151
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:13,884
At least like I like.

152
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:15,099
Bekah: Oh,that's a good one.

153
00:09:15,624 --> 00:09:18,864
Ram贸n: Just my choices.Uh,if an,
like,going by what you were

154
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:21,234
saying,Dan,right?Like if an app,
if Apple's gonna have one of

155
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:24,563
their conferences in10minutes,I
could see where the whole stock

156
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:30,114
thing will go.But also like when
having conversations,I,I,I,I can

157
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:34,124
say,uh,the correct,like how I
could say the things that don't,

158
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:36,413
uh,make me look silly.

159
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:39,428
Dan: Oh.Or like the argument
where you think of the comeback

160
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:43,269
later,you know,but you like look
in your head and say,you're like,

161
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:44,859
oh man,that's what I should have
been,you know,

162
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:48,908
Ram贸n: did you know that there's
a French term for that?Uh,they

163
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:53,048
call it which is like a f a
staircase argument because it's

164
00:09:53,048 --> 00:09:55,989
like what you think of as you're
going down the stairs.After

165
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:57,219
having had that conversation,

166
00:09:57,443 --> 00:09:59,693
Dan: Uh,yes.That's great.That,
Ooh,I like

167
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:00,908
Ram贸n: I,I really like it.

168
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:06,504
Dan: Yeah.That happens to me a
lot.Yeah.But like,time isn't,you

169
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:09,714
know,it's,it's,it's a brand,you
know,it's like a tree.There's

170
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:13,974
like decis,you know,what happens
in the future?this is what I'm

171
00:10:13,974 --> 00:10:16,283
saying.If you change your mind,
then you're gonna change the

172
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:20,663
future,but then you have to look
again or something.you know,it's

173
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:23,004
like a,what was that?One of the
Adventures movies.And Dr.

174
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:26,964
Stranges is sitting there like
for like an hour,imagining all of

175
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:29,933
the different futures,you know.
So if you can see10minutes in the

176
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:32,183
future,can you see all the
different branches?Or can you

177
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:37,494
just like see the branch that
would exist if you didn't look

178
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:41,724
you know,you know what I

179
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:44,828
Bekah: ever seen the episode of
community where they have the

180
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,538
different outcome?

181
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:48,969
Dan: Yes.Yes.I love that

182
00:10:49,104 --> 00:10:51,474
Bekah: I think it actually won
award.It's a really good one.

183
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:56,558
Dan: Yeah,it's the,uh,I don't
know,Ram贸n,if you've seen the,

184
00:10:56,558 --> 00:11:01,509
the meme of,um,of what's his
name,carrying the pizza box into

185
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:02,288
the room and everything's on

186
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:03,818
Ram贸n: I thought so.I have seen
that

187
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,158
Dan: episode's from that one.
Yeah.Yeah,yeah.Don Glover.Thank

188
00:11:06,158 --> 00:11:08,349
you.That episode,that's what that
episode is.

189
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:11,948
Ram贸n: Yeah.Okay.Okay.I did
wonder,like I've,I've never seen

190
00:11:11,948 --> 00:11:13,989
community.I was like,huh,what?
What's this show about

191
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:19,104
Dan: anyway.Uh,

192
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:23,918
Bekah: we,before we go down the
community rabbit hole uh,we're

193
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:28,839
here to talk to you.And so,uh,we
always like to get an origin

194
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:31,989
story of everyone who's on the
podcast and we're,I'm gonna ask

195
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:36,129
you to kick that off by giving us
one word that describes your

196
00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:37,599
journey into tech.

197
00:11:38,994 --> 00:11:42,144
Ram贸n: thank you.Um,I will admit
I have come prepared because

198
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:45,803
these kinds of questions,uh,send
me spiraling.Uh,so the one I

199
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:52,298
settled on was,uh,curious.Uh,and
I think that's because like,I,I

200
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:55,509
have over the years,like I was
talking to Dan a little bit about

201
00:11:55,509 --> 00:12:00,188
like,uh,being,being in,uh,being,
uh,working independently and what

202
00:12:00,193 --> 00:12:03,129
I love about that,uh,sorry,am I,
am I allowed to like,expand on

203
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:03,249
it?

204
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:06,563
Bekah: You definitely are
allowed.Go for it.

205
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:12,203
Ram贸n: awesome.Um,One thing I
like about it is that one thing I

206
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:15,323
like about like being,being,uh,
independent and,and having the,

207
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:18,683
and,and,and the line of work that
I do is that it allows me to,you

208
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:22,283
know,explore different,uh,not
just tech stacks,but industries

209
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,504
through freelancing.Like,you
know,I've gotten to work with,

210
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:28,823
like,uh,in my past I was a,a,a
freelancer and I've gotten to

211
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:33,293
work with like,you know,um,
medical,uh,companies I've gotten

212
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:35,033
to work with,like FinTech I've
gotten to work with like

213
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:39,668
refugees.And what I,what I've
learned over time is that,I kind

214
00:12:39,668 --> 00:12:42,519
of get a kick out of the whole
like,onboarding process,not just

215
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:46,328
for like a company,but also for
like a code base.And so I,it's

216
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:50,139
gotten me comfortable with being
uncomfortable that moment where

217
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:54,038
you're like,all right,guess we're
gonna like figure out how the

218
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:57,684
JavaScript tooling for this one
works.And you know,it's,I don't

219
00:12:57,684 --> 00:13:00,294
wanna say rarely consistent,but
there's always some

220
00:13:00,294 --> 00:13:02,245
inconsistencies there.You're
like,okay,I guess I'm gonna

221
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:06,595
install this thing I've never
heard of before,Um,and I kind of

222
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:09,955
like that it's gotten me
comfortable with it.It's gotten

223
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,024
me comfortable to like,dig in a
little deeper.It's gotten me

224
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:16,315
comfortable with also like
knowing where to draw the line in

225
00:13:16,315 --> 00:13:19,764
terms of like how deep I need to
go into something to consider it.

226
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:21,205
Understood.I dunno if that makes.

227
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:25,855
Bekah: Yeah.Yeah,I think so.And
I,and that's really tricky cuz

228
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:29,695
there's often not a hard line,
especially with tech always

229
00:13:29,695 --> 00:13:32,784
changing,right?Like sometimes you
feel like you're right there

230
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:35,875
hitting that line and then it
moves and like,ah,now I gotta

231
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,446
learn this new thing.

232
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,149
Ram贸n: Yeah.And you know,I've,I
get the impression that this is

233
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,820
some,a skill we pick over,over
time because like when I work

234
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:46,809
with,uh,emerging developers,a lot
of the time they're,they,they

235
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:49,450
will grow frustrated.For example,
uh,I gotten folks who've gotten

236
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,779
frustrated like,okay,I understand
the concept of recursion,but like

237
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:55,384
I need to go deeper and like,
and,and I need to understand,

238
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:58,144
like,I don't understand why it's
do,why it's,does this,why it does

239
00:13:58,144 --> 00:14:00,934
that?Why is it that we use this
library?I don't understand why,

240
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:04,235
where,where do,where do push and
pop come from in,where are they

241
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,865
defined in the JavaScript
standard library,for example.Um,

242
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,294
and,and stuff like this.And one
of my favorite questions I've

243
00:14:10,294 --> 00:14:12,514
ever gotten,I'm getting a little
ahead of myself,but it just keeps

244
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:16,445
coming back to me.Um,I used to
do,I used to cocha,uh,rails girls

245
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:18,995
workshops,which I think they were
pretty prevalent in Europe.I

246
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:21,904
think the equivalent for the,for
North America would be,uh,rails

247
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:26,085
Bridge.which was,uh,which are a
series of workshops for getting,

248
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,325
uh,underrepresented folks into,
into tech through learning Ruby

249
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:33,434
on Rails.And so I would do a lot
of those and I,I would coach at a

250
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:35,625
lot of those.And one of my
favorite questions I've ever

251
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,924
gotten that to this day
infuriates me in a good way is

252
00:14:38,955 --> 00:14:42,365
they,somebody ask me like,Hey,
Ram贸n,um,why is it called a diff.

253
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:47,695
and I am to this day,livid with
myself that I never wondered why

254
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:50,695
it was called a diff.It was just
the thing that I've been taught.

255
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:52,674
There's too much of in my markup.
You know,

256
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:53,445
Bekah: Okay.

257
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:57,684
Ram贸n: turns out it's divider or
division one of the two.Um,

258
00:14:57,715 --> 00:14:58,004
Dan: Yeah,

259
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:01,315
Ram贸n: but,but the point is that
I,I never wondered this,so that,

260
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,659
that what it,what it.What I'm
trying to strive for is more of

261
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,669
that curiosity.It's like
questioning things.That's how we

262
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:09,580
get those advancements in not
just tech,but in like

263
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,070
communities.Industries and and,
and,uh,how we live as people.

264
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:19,389
Dan: I,I love that so much.And
like the,the idea.I,I absolutely

265
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:23,559
agree with you that that skill
of,that,the skill of like finding

266
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,720
that stuff out is a skill that
you learn over time and get

267
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,600
better at over time.I feel like
that's one of the,you know,one of

268
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,100
the,I don't know what the right
word is,signifiers of Kind of

269
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,284
like one of the big differences
between somebody who's closer to

270
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:39,335
maybe a senior dev than a junior
dev is the ability to be able to

271
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:42,754
do that,right?To dive in and,and
pick stuff up on your own and not

272
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:45,965
be,you know,everybody gets
overwhelmed sometimes,but like,

273
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:50,162
not like instantly maybe feel
more comfortable,um,you know,

274
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:52,562
diving into a new code base that
you have know nothing about,um,

275
00:15:52,562 --> 00:15:57,294
like you were saying.but the
curiosity is,I don't know if you

276
00:15:57,294 --> 00:15:59,725
can teach that.Right.And that's
like,that's one of those things

277
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:03,654
that,um,even with somebody who's
brand new to development,you can

278
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:07,375
kind of see that.And that is,I
feel like a signifier that a

279
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,715
person maybe,you know,has a good
chance of you like a very good

280
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:15,235
developer.Right.Is that,that
curiosity,um,that,I don't know.

281
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:18,355
Urge to like,do what you're
trying,like why is this called a

282
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:21,835
div?What,like what,what does this
thing do?You know,like as opposed

283
00:16:21,835 --> 00:16:24,971
to,and,and sometimes you have to
just.accept that somebody is

284
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:27,131
saying,okay,use,push and move on.
Cuz we're not like trying to

285
00:16:27,131 --> 00:16:29,772
learn about push right now,you
know,like use this array thing

286
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:32,442
because,you know,but eventually,
like you're gonna go back and,

287
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:37,721
and kind of dig into it,you know?
Um,and I dunno,I just,I guess

288
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:40,121
agree with,I dunno if I'm really
adding anything to what you said,

289
00:16:40,121 --> 00:16:41,111
but I,I agree

290
00:16:41,111 --> 00:16:43,932
Ram贸n: no,you are.Thank you.

291
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:47,792
Bekah: Yeah.Okay.So let's take a
step back and think about your

292
00:16:47,851 --> 00:16:50,552
journey into tech and how it
started.So,where was the

293
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:55,022
curiosity first sparked for you
and how has that kind of shaped

294
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:56,192
your career trajectory?

295
00:16:57,302 --> 00:16:59,971
Ram贸n: Yeah,totally.Um,and I
think I,I think I might've

296
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:02,642
misused my,my one word cuz there
were two of them,right?One of

297
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:05,311
them is like to describe me and
the other one is to describe my

298
00:17:05,311 --> 00:17:07,082
origin source.I think I might've
done that the way,other way

299
00:17:07,082 --> 00:17:08,071
around and I apologize.

300
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:09,047
Bekah: that's cool.

301
00:17:09,632 --> 00:17:12,211
Ram贸n: and I'm gonna cheat
because I'm gonna use a

302
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:15,751
hyphenated word.Uh,and that is
pay it forward.

303
00:17:16,277 --> 00:17:16,666
Bekah: Hmm.

304
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:20,701
Ram贸n: Uh,because at several
stages of my career,so I started

305
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:24,781
out,uh,in high school,I was like,
I don't know what I wanna do.Uh,

306
00:17:24,781 --> 00:17:27,842
and I was really into,uh,
theater,but that didn't look like

307
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,211
a career that I could do here in
Australia.Cause my German isn't

308
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:33,961
great.So,uh,I thought of another
thing that I did okay in,and that

309
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:38,731
was,um,I,I did okay in computer
classes.So I enrolled at,at

310
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:42,721
university to do computer science
and I wasn't a great student.Uh,

311
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:46,487
if I'm,and,uh,and I was
struggling.I was like,classes

312
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:48,436
were in German,and that was,that
was,you know,it's not my first

313
00:17:48,436 --> 00:17:51,856
language.So it was,it was,it was
a bit tough going,but uh,you

314
00:17:51,856 --> 00:17:55,517
know,and then when I met my,when
my,when my met my partner at the

315
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:58,186
time,spouse now,uh,and the
question came with like,all

316
00:17:58,186 --> 00:18:00,586
right,let's find,let's find an
apartment to move in.And I didn't

317
00:18:00,586 --> 00:18:02,906
have an income.I didn't,I had
zero experience.Like I had just

318
00:18:03,196 --> 00:18:07,007
bought the,the first aluminum
MacBook,you know,the2008

319
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:08,477
Dan: Oh yeah.Nice.

320
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:11,132
Ram贸n: and I was like,Hey,like
this was,I think this was like

321
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,132
about the time that Max were,
were like getting cool with like

322
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:20,761
developers and like students and,
uh,a again,and,uh,and I,I,you

323
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:23,491
know,I had installed Xcode,which
is the development suite for

324
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:27,692
making MACHAs.And uh,and I was
thinking like,okay,well let,I'm

325
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:30,112
having fun with this,but there's
no.Experienced enough.So I was

326
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:34,011
looking at want ads online for
like babysitting jobs,and my

327
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:37,311
partner goes like,Hey,why don't
you like,here's a Mac developer,

328
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:40,491
um,job post.Somebody's looking
for a freelance Mac developer,

329
00:18:40,491 --> 00:18:43,912
which is great for me because I,
because I'm not European.I,I

330
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:47,902
can't get a job permit as a
student or it's harder for me to

331
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:50,991
do.So it just made more sense to
be a freelancer.I,I promise this

332
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:58,102
is the short version,um,So I,on a
whim,like I'm,I'm not exact,I'm

333
00:18:58,102 --> 00:19:03,961
not.On a,on a,like a confident
whim,I applied and the person got

334
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:06,332
back to me and said like,Hey,
let's,let's go get a coffee at

335
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:08,642
Cafe Mozart because you know,
this is Vienna.You gotta go to

336
00:19:09,301 --> 00:19:12,001
you gotta go to a fancy coffee
house.That,of course,happens to

337
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:16,201
be called Cafe Mozart.Anyway,so I
meet,I wore a suit for like the

338
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:21,571
third time of my life,Um,and,uh,
and,and this person,he,he sits me

339
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:23,852
down and he says like,Hey Ram贸n,
listen,um,really nice to meet

340
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:27,727
you.Super cool that we went to
the same,uh,high.that is super

341
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:31,567
lucky that,that I,that,that was a
coincidence.But he sat me down

342
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,247
and he said like,Hey Ramma,
listen,I gotta ask you like

343
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:37,507
you've got no experience.Why did
you apply for this?And I told him

344
00:19:37,507 --> 00:19:40,807
like,his name is Philip.I told
him like,Hey Philip,listen.Um,I

345
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:45,616
know.and again,feeling confident
and,and,and I was like,listen,I

346
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:47,896
think I can learn this well.Like
I've been doing some excode,I've

347
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,846
been learning some pro,I've been
doing some programming stuff.

348
00:19:50,116 --> 00:19:53,537
I've got some of the basics from
university.I'm no expert.I,I,to

349
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:56,626
this day,I still have,don't have
my degree.So that's a whole other

350
00:19:56,632 --> 00:20:00,707
rabbit hole.Um,you can take as
long as you want in ocean

351
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:04,666
universities.Anyway,um,so he sat
me down and,and so he,and,and I

352
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,487
told him like,look,I think I can
learn quickly.I think I can,I

353
00:20:07,491 --> 00:20:12,047
think I can get.um,quickly with
developing these,uh,his Mac apps

354
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:16,186
and,uh,and he said,listen,well
listen,uh,talking to you sounds

355
00:20:16,186 --> 00:20:19,336
nice.I don't think you're ready
yet,but I'll tell you what,I need

356
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:23,086
somebody to do email support from
me for my apps.Here's a book I

357
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:26,747
recommend.Uh,and so he gave me
the link to buy,uh,um,there's

358
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:29,207
this publisher called Big Nerd
Ranch,and they had these,uh,

359
00:20:29,237 --> 00:20:31,906
programming books from,for,uh,
different platforms,including

360
00:20:31,906 --> 00:20:38,402
Makos,and they were great.Uh,and
he's like,uh,yeah,do this and

361
00:20:38,402 --> 00:20:41,311
let's talk about it again.And
since then,like he gave me a

362
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:44,192
chance.And so a few months later
he,I still have an email from

363
00:20:44,196 --> 00:20:47,311
him,like,I need to frame it.The
subject line was like,highly

364
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:50,731
impressed with your work like
that.It's so,it's so small things

365
00:20:50,737 --> 00:20:55,471
that like you carry for the rest
of your life,you know?And,uh,so

366
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:57,751
eventually he,he gave me that
chance.Like I read,I went through

367
00:20:57,751 --> 00:21:00,842
the book.I felt confident and I
started like fixing bugs,adding

368
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:04,517
small features to different apps.
I work with him to this day,but

369
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:06,916
it's,it's the fact that he took
me under his wing.He taught me

370
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:10,606
like he taught me version.This
was subversion at the time.Um,

371
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:10,967
Dan: yeah.

372
00:21:12,557 --> 00:21:15,227
Ram贸n: uh,he taught me version
control.Like he taught me like

373
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:18,346
how to use,uh,Redmine,which is
one of these project management

374
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:21,497
tools.Uh,he taught me all of
these things that I would've

375
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:25,471
learned at university.But I think
for me,Learning in a practical

376
00:21:25,471 --> 00:21:28,142
way,learning on a hands-on way.
Like this is like real life

377
00:21:28,142 --> 00:21:30,301
stuff.Like I think one of the
hardest things about learning

378
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:34,981
version control in,in a,in,in an
enclosed like non-specific

379
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:37,741
environment is that that
collaborative,like the,a little

380
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:41,672
bit of the chaotic part is lost
of like,you know,merge conflicts

381
00:21:41,672 --> 00:21:44,251
and all that.So like learning to
navigate those was something that

382
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:46,592
was really helpful for me.But
yeah,so this,this person just

383
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:52,606
sort of gave me that.and,and I've
got a hand,I've had a handful of

384
00:21:52,606 --> 00:21:55,817
those in my life where,for
example,my first job endeavor was

385
00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:58,186
my friend Jess reaching out to me
one day and saying like,Hey,

386
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:01,846
listen,I see like I can see on
your cv.I was feeling a little

387
00:22:01,852 --> 00:22:05,777
bit,um,again,confident and I was
like,you know,I've been,you know,

388
00:22:05,777 --> 00:22:08,666
giving talks,uh,coaching at
things.I've been like working at,

389
00:22:08,886 --> 00:22:13,277
uh,NGOs to help underrepresented
folks get into tech.Why not turn

390
00:22:13,277 --> 00:22:15,767
that into a,you know,you know how
on your cvs,or sorry,your

391
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,886
resumes,you'll have like little
areas that of your skills.I

392
00:22:18,886 --> 00:22:21,436
thought I'll put Dev in there and
see what developer relations in

393
00:22:21,436 --> 00:22:24,557
there and see what happens.And it
happened,just reached out to me

394
00:22:24,557 --> 00:22:29,446
and said like,I've got this job
offer.I don't want to like,um,do

395
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:32,686
you want a job?Do a job share
with me.So we get,we split,we

396
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:36,166
split the salary,we split the
work.I,she brings in her,uh,

397
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:39,527
devil expertise.I bring in my,my
knowledge in in tech and we sort

398
00:22:39,527 --> 00:22:42,557
of like turn that into one
developer advocate.And the fact

399
00:22:42,557 --> 00:22:47,267
that she gave me this chance,the
fact that she,you know,gave me a

400
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:51,707
hand,um,that sort of shaped me.
And,and this has happened a

401
00:22:51,707 --> 00:22:55,366
couple of times,has said,and
that's why I say pay it forward,

402
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:59,636
because like,you know,why not?
Like,why not do what I can?Given

403
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:02,116
the luck,the,the fortune and the
privilege I've had to empower

404
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:05,176
others to do the same.And again,
that was a short version,

405
00:23:08,356 --> 00:23:13,561
Bekah: I think that's awesome and
I really love.The theme of you

406
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:17,221
saying you were feeling a little
bit confident or something.Cuz I

407
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:21,211
think,you know,even for me,so a
couple weeks ago I was laid off

408
00:23:21,662 --> 00:23:26,251
and now I'm trying to figure out
what I want to be doing and just

409
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:29,761
kind of taking some deliberate
time to think.Things through,do I

410
00:23:29,761 --> 00:23:34,321
want to continue on the Derell
path?But the great thing is it's

411
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:39,511
led to some conversations that I
wouldn't have otherwise had I met

412
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:45,902
with somebody who's part of,um,
a,a small but prominent business

413
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:51,842
in tech this morning,and they're
hiring for a full-time role.I

414
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:54,692
don't want a full-time role right
now.And so we kind of talked

415
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:57,961
about what I could be doing in
terms of consulting and it's

416
00:23:57,961 --> 00:24:04,547
different than what most roles
are.Advertised,but I think that

417
00:24:04,906 --> 00:24:08,926
the idea is kind of like what you
were saying with Jess,both of you

418
00:24:08,957 --> 00:24:13,336
contributing something to become
one dev,and so there's like a

419
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:17,297
different take because right now
in tech there's a lot of

420
00:24:17,297 --> 00:24:21,676
uncertainty about things and so
like maybe finding that position

421
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:27,467
where you can still be.Helpful in
an environment or in a company is

422
00:24:27,557 --> 00:24:30,826
a way to get your foot in the
door and see whether or not this

423
00:24:30,826 --> 00:24:33,856
is a good company to be working
for or to gain some of that

424
00:24:33,862 --> 00:24:38,207
experience.Because we also see a
lot of folks who are not finding

425
00:24:38,207 --> 00:24:42,436
jobs right now and trying to
figure out like,how,how do you

426
00:24:42,442 --> 00:24:49,172
stand out in,in what you're
applying for?When you're doing so

427
00:24:49,172 --> 00:24:52,051
much applying and I think that,
you know,you even just putting

428
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:56,791
dev on your,your CV or your
resume is one way to do that,

429
00:24:56,791 --> 00:25:00,541
right?You're like taking a step
in the right direction and you

430
00:25:00,547 --> 00:25:03,842
are doing things that you might
be nervous about or reaching out

431
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:07,011
to people,even though you might
be a little bit nervous about it.

432
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:11,102
You know,I yolo a DM two days ago
and I've got a meeting on Friday

433
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:15,176
with someone I've never met and.
Somebody said like,oh,you have to

434
00:25:15,176 --> 00:25:18,626
teach me how to do that.Like,I
don't know,I I wait for that

435
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:23,876
exact second where I have like a
little bit of um,uh,confidence

436
00:25:24,537 --> 00:25:27,416
and then I make sure I do it
right then because if I start

437
00:25:27,422 --> 00:25:29,186
thinking about it,I'm not going
to do it.

438
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:34,277
Ram贸n: I feel you.I feel you.Big
time and,and,uh,and I think it's,

439
00:25:34,277 --> 00:25:36,076
it's something that's been
dawning on me over the last year

440
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,781
or so.It's,it is those moments
where you feel like,because the,

441
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:44,491
I mean,as you well put it,it's,
it's,I think,I think it's,you

442
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:49,291
know,standing out.And I think
beyond that,it's also sort of,I

443
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:52,832
read the,I,uh,a few years ago,I
read the book,uh,what is It?How

444
00:25:53,071 --> 00:25:57,301
The,how to Make Friends and
Influence People by Dale

445
00:25:57,301 --> 00:25:57,781
Carnegie,

446
00:25:58,112 --> 00:25:58,442
Bekah: Yeah.

447
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:02,461
Ram贸n: and,um,I think I Got it.
Yeah.Something like that.How to

448
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:06,811
Win Friends,anyone.Yeah.Um,and
one thing that I really took away

449
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:11,717
from.That book was,uh,the fact
that just like you love helping

450
00:26:11,717 --> 00:26:15,856
people,so do pe so do the,the pe.
Most of the people that you reach

451
00:26:15,856 --> 00:26:20,207
out to will love helping you.And
that was a tough pill to swallow

452
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:24,527
Cause I hate asking.Um,no,it's
not that I hate it,I'm bad at

453
00:26:24,527 --> 00:26:25,247
asking for help.

454
00:26:25,636 --> 00:26:25,696
Bekah: Yeah.

455
00:26:26,297 --> 00:26:30,797
Ram贸n: Um,but it's those moments
where you just assert what it is

456
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:34,096
that you want,what it is that you
need.And if somebody can provide

457
00:26:34,102 --> 00:26:39,436
that,and they,of course,Can and,
and are willing to,they will,and

458
00:26:39,436 --> 00:26:40,606
it will make all the difference.

459
00:26:42,031 --> 00:26:45,301
Bekah: Yeah,and I think that
asking for help,it is one of the

460
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:49,382
hardest things,but it's also a
strength.I think that so many

461
00:26:49,386 --> 00:26:52,172
people think it's a weakness to
ask for help,but it's

462
00:26:52,426 --> 00:26:54,366
Ram贸n: No,no.Yeah.

463
00:26:54,422 --> 00:26:58,981
Bekah: you.It helps you to grow
so much faster in what you're

464
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:02,041
doing.It creates connections and
relationships,builds

465
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:05,521
relationships with other people,
and it builds that trust because

466
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:08,432
you know that if someone's
willing to ask you for help,they

467
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:11,402
trust you in some sense,and
that's gonna be reciprocated.

468
00:27:12,842 --> 00:27:16,321
Ram贸n: absolutely.I agree100%.
Like I let to be,let me be super

469
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:19,172
clear,like I have a deep
admiration for folks who are just

470
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:22,201
like,huh,I'm stuck on something.
Let me reach out for help.Uh,

471
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:25,366
that was,um,Not to side note too
much,but like,that's something

472
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:29,176
that I felt very strongly about.
I wrote,um,I wrote a blog post a

473
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:32,477
few months ago about like,when
you're stuck in,in,in a coding

474
00:27:32,481 --> 00:27:35,477
problem,when do you reach out for
help?Because I am definitely more

475
00:27:35,477 --> 00:27:39,317
on the side of like,I will never
bother anyone.Uh,this,I think

476
00:27:39,317 --> 00:27:42,376
this was a lot for me because I
was freelancing a long time that

477
00:27:42,616 --> 00:27:47,477
I didn't have anybody um,to,
cause you know,I wasn't a member

478
00:27:47,477 --> 00:27:51,346
of a.That I was,it was actually,
Ooh,okay.I'm sorry.I'm all over

479
00:27:51,346 --> 00:27:55,846
the place today.Um,uh,so right.
Um,so I think,I think that

480
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:58,967
reaching out for help learning to
reach out for help is,is,is it It

481
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:02,057
is a skill.It is a strength,but I
think it can be honed.It can be

482
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:02,656
developed,

483
00:28:03,644 --> 00:28:06,584
Bekah: Yeah,absolutely.And you
know,we,a added a section to the

484
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:09,644
site,I'm gonna have to get that
blog post link from you,uh,about

485
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:14,503
how to ask for questions with
your code because we get issues

486
00:28:14,534 --> 00:28:17,114
over and over,you know,and
there's a balance there.Right.

487
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:21,134
And you've worked with a lot of
folks who are coming into tech,

488
00:28:21,138 --> 00:28:24,824
so can you talk a little bit more
about like,where is the balance

489
00:28:24,824 --> 00:28:29,384
between asking re too quickly
and,you know,waiting for the

490
00:28:29,384 --> 00:28:30,523
right moment to do that?

491
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:35,991
Ram贸n: Yeah,and,uh,it's,I mean,I
really,really hesitate to say it

492
00:28:35,991 --> 00:28:40,821
depends,but hear me out.Uh,I
think,I think the,the exact

493
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:44,511
heuristic can vary from person to
person.I think the exact like

494
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:49,761
timing can vary from person.Like
my,my,uh,go-to is half an hour if

495
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,422
by half an hour.I haven't like,
gotten anywhere or half an hour

496
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:56,932
plus a walk cuz my head,my,my,
like when I,when I walk my dog

497
00:28:56,932 --> 00:29:00,771
for example,that's one of my best
debuggers in the world,like the

498
00:29:00,771 --> 00:29:06,561
back of my head.Um,so right.So
if,if,if by a certain time I

499
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:09,711
haven't,uh,come to a solution,
then I will reach out for help

500
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:14,527
because asking too early,Yes,
it'll get you a solution,but

501
00:29:14,531 --> 00:29:17,136
especially if you're like,
starting out,I find that that can

502
00:29:17,136 --> 00:29:20,017
sort of impede you from
developing a skill of like

503
00:29:20,017 --> 00:29:24,636
problem solving,uh,how to,how to
research an issue,how to like,

504
00:29:25,027 --> 00:29:28,477
deal with a,like,how to navigate
an error message.I think it's,I

505
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:31,686
think it's easy to forget how
scary error me error messages can

506
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,882
be when you're starting out.and
later on as well,let's be honest.

507
00:29:34,882 --> 00:29:39,051
Like who,who hasn't,who hasn't
pushed a Gajillion Times domain

508
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:41,481
trying to like get an a GitHub
action to work,right.

509
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:44,047
Dan: Yeah.

510
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:49,192
Ram贸n: I'm glad it's not to
speak,but um,yeah,so doing it too

511
00:29:49,192 --> 00:29:52,041
early can,can,can and of course
impede you and cause

512
00:29:52,047 --> 00:29:55,192
interruptions in a team,but I
think waiting too long,which is

513
00:29:55,192 --> 00:30:01,071
something I'm guilty of,can also.
Delay a timeline,delay a team.If

514
00:30:01,071 --> 00:30:03,412
you're not com,like
communication.Like one of the,

515
00:30:03,771 --> 00:30:06,471
one of the most important skills
I picked up from freelancing is

516
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:12,382
that of communication.Like one of
my most essential core skills.

517
00:30:12,531 --> 00:30:16,221
Uh,as a freelancer,it's highly
critical because I need to tell a

518
00:30:16,221 --> 00:30:20,271
client,Hey,this is where we're
at.Like,you know,being,if

519
00:30:20,271 --> 00:30:22,642
they're,if they're,if my client
is non-technical,then I need to

520
00:30:22,642 --> 00:30:27,561
put it in a way that,that is,
that is.That is,uh,in a,in a,in a

521
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:30,981
way that they can,um,that,that,
that can be,yeah,easily,uh,

522
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:34,372
understood or,um,
straightforwardly understood.And

523
00:30:34,612 --> 00:30:38,031
if I'm,for example,dealing with,
uh,if I'm working in a team,this

524
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:40,221
helps me sort of like give good
code reviews and all that,and

525
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:42,682
give updates and all that.
There's something that we pick up

526
00:30:42,682 --> 00:30:48,471
a lot.Um,yeah,so,right.So
delaying a team too much can also

527
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:51,741
be detrimental.So finding that
sweet spot,I said for me it's

528
00:30:51,862 --> 00:30:54,326
half an hour plus a.How about
you?I'm.

529
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:00,567
Dan: I,I mean,I like that.I like
that rule.Sorry,Bekah.Do you want

530
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:00,896
to go

531
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:01,946
Bekah: no,you.

532
00:31:03,537 --> 00:31:06,116
Dan: Uh,I,I just was,I just
wanted to call out some of the,

533
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:09,297
like,you know,you talked about
being independent versus being on

534
00:31:09,297 --> 00:31:13,707
a team,things like that.Right.
And I,I found like,and,and,and of

535
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:16,616
course I,I'm like,I've been doing
this for a long time,and so lots

536
00:31:16,616 --> 00:31:19,797
of times when I get stuck it's,
you know,there's a lot of things

537
00:31:19,797 --> 00:31:23,906
going on right?I still get stuck.
Like I,I do,like,don't,you know,

538
00:31:23,906 --> 00:31:27,416
don't get me wrong,but like my,
my issue lots of times is,is

539
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:31,527
there's so much context around it
that it takes so long to explain

540
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:34,946
the problem,you know,and I'm
independent myself.And so there

541
00:31:34,946 --> 00:31:37,376
aren't any team members that also
have their heads all the way down

542
00:31:37,376 --> 00:31:38,037
into.

543
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:38,616
Ram贸n: Yeah.

544
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:42,176
Dan: The,the,the,you know,the,
the,the,the space that you're in,

545
00:31:42,386 --> 00:31:45,207
right?Um,like you will find when
you're working together on a

546
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:48,866
team,which is one of the reasons
why being on a team is,is can be

547
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:55,047
so valuable and powerful.Um,but
the,I'm,I'm,I mean,I'm awful at

548
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:59,366
asking for help.I get stuck all
the time and I just,you know,um,

549
00:32:00,176 --> 00:32:04,497
I don't know.I.Just slam my head
against it,until I can get

550
00:32:04,497 --> 00:32:05,096
through it.Usually

551
00:32:05,696 --> 00:32:05,997
Ram贸n: I feel.

552
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:09,146
Dan: Uh,but it,I guess my point
is the,the problem for me is,is

553
00:32:09,146 --> 00:32:15,027
identifying like what the actual
question is.And I think that is a

554
00:32:15,027 --> 00:32:19,346
skill that like can be honed and
can be useful for people of all

555
00:32:19,346 --> 00:32:23,277
at all,like skill levels and all
like experience levels of,of.

556
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:27,416
Sort of asking the right
question,you know,sort of like,

557
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:30,836
what is the actual question?This
thing's broken,you know?And,and,

558
00:32:30,836 --> 00:32:33,386
and we've,we've had,we've helped
people in,in Virtual Coffee lots

559
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:36,596
of times,like,we'll have people
do this where somebody has says

560
00:32:36,596 --> 00:32:38,817
like,oh,this thing's broken.Does
that mean anybody have experience

561
00:32:38,821 --> 00:32:39,686
with this?Can you help

562
00:32:40,602 --> 00:32:40,902
Ram贸n: Yeah.

563
00:32:41,156 --> 00:32:45,896
Dan: paste in code You know,and
like the trying to narrow down

564
00:32:45,896 --> 00:32:50,922
what the actual problem is,is,
is,is one of the things.I A g may

565
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:55,241
mean a good question.Answerer
would,you know,have is that

566
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:57,311
skill,you know,but it's like a
skill you can do for yourself as

567
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:59,801
well,right?Okay.Like,what is
actually happening here?Take a

568
00:32:59,801 --> 00:33:06,132
step back.Um,you know,that,that
sort of thing.So I,uh,well,to

569
00:33:06,132 --> 00:33:07,843
answer your original question,I
don't really have a rule about,

570
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:10,902
about when to ask for help
because I'm bad at it.But,uh,I

571
00:33:10,902 --> 00:33:11,922
think that's a solid rule.

572
00:33:12,243 --> 00:33:13,094
Ram贸n: Totally underst.

573
00:33:13,878 --> 00:33:18,169
Bekah: I think for me it's been
different since I've been in

574
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:22,638
Devra because I'm not working in
large complex code bases most of

575
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:28,699
the time,and so it's developing
code for open source projects or

576
00:33:28,703 --> 00:33:33,828
for a blog post or something,so
it makes it a little bit.Simpler

577
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:39,108
to maybe debug or figure things
out.But I have a,a couple of

578
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:43,699
things,like I've been using chat
g p T a lot in my work,and so

579
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:46,489
being able to ask questions
there,like,can you explain to me

580
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:49,378
what's going on in this function
and if there's a better way,For

581
00:33:49,378 --> 00:33:55,588
this thing to be done,um,often
leads me down that path of asking

582
00:33:55,588 --> 00:33:59,848
more specific questions about
things.So I feel like that if

583
00:33:59,854 --> 00:34:03,509
you,if you don't have someone to
ask questions to and you are

584
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:07,449
learning how to code,using tools
like that can be really useful

585
00:34:07,749 --> 00:34:11,699
for helping you understand like,
what are the questions that you

586
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:15,599
should be asking?And it doesn't
necessarily have to be about code

587
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:21,079
like we're homeschooling my13
year old now.And his ability to

588
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:24,889
ask questions and then to dig
further into topics is a really

589
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:29,958
useful way to engage in some kind
of response and,and learning how

590
00:34:29,963 --> 00:34:34,728
to ask those questions.Um,but
back to your question and when do

591
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:38,688
I ask questions?I usually don't
time myself,and I probably should

592
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:43,489
because I,I will lose all track
of time.But it's,um,the feeling

593
00:34:43,608 --> 00:34:51,244
when I have.19tabs open,and then
I'm starting to open up tabs that

594
00:34:51,244 --> 00:34:55,443
I already have open and I'm
rereading the same responses,and

595
00:34:55,443 --> 00:35:00,063
I'm like,okay,I have already
tried all of these things,so it's

596
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:06,603
probably time for me to ask
somebody a question since I.I

597
00:35:06,784 --> 00:35:09,903
still don't have the answer,and
I'm still looking at all of the

598
00:35:09,903 --> 00:35:14,043
same things.So it it,it depends
on the,the number of tabs I have

599
00:35:14,043 --> 00:35:14,764
open,I guess.

600
00:35:15,235 --> 00:35:17,934
Ram贸n: Yeah,I,uh,I really,I
relate very much with that

601
00:35:18,775 --> 00:35:23,454
especially like the,the,the
mental tabs as well.I have Um,

602
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:28,525
but what you said about like
formulating questions and like.

603
00:35:29,735 --> 00:35:31,625
like,one of the things that I
think a lot about is like how to

604
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:34,894
make yourself as helpable as
possible.I think it's also a

605
00:35:34,894 --> 00:35:38,405
skill that we develop over time
of like narrowing a doubt.Like

606
00:35:38,885 --> 00:35:41,465
what you said,Dan,about,like how
at the beginning,and this happens

607
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:43,715
to a lot of us,like I spent a
long time teaching children to

608
00:35:43,715 --> 00:35:46,445
code,and that's,and that's
something that,that's,that's very

609
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:49,340
prominent to the beginning
because you don't know what's.If

610
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,889
something is working or,or if
it's meant to be broken or not.

611
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:56,539
So what?You just go,it's broken,
then it falls on me.The,the,the,

612
00:35:56,539 --> 00:36:02,059
the mentee to be like the mentor,
pardon me?To be like,okay,is this

613
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,730
a good time to go into like a
little bit of a deep dive?Am I

614
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,840
just gonna fix this for them?Do I
help guide a,a big,a big tool?I

615
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,300
like in situations like this
where there's not a lot of,like

616
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:15,320
narrowness is,uh,guided
questions.Are you familiar with.

617
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,610
Bekah: I don't think so.Tell me
more.

618
00:36:19,405 --> 00:36:21,739
Ram贸n: Oh,these are,that's like
one of my favorite tools in like,

619
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:24,889
uh,um,not just teaching,but I
think in,in,in,in most of our

620
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:29,119
core skills in general,which is
like asking a question that

621
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,510
insights critical thought and a
discussion.

622
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,400
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

623
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:37,610
Ram贸n: So for example,like,uh,I
don't know,say like,this doesn't

624
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:40,400
work.And,and,and these can,and
these can start out quite broad,

625
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,690
right?This doesn't work.Oh,cool.
Um,what's it meant to be,and I

626
00:36:44,695 --> 00:36:47,719
know this sound like,I know this
sounds condescending,but I think

627
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:51,170
like going into like a little bit
of like,okay,let's,let's take a

628
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,599
look at this.Let's try and
explore this together.What's,

629
00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:55,550
what exactly isn't working and
make it and being,you know,you

630
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:58,070
can be open and clear from the
start.Like,let me help you sort

631
00:36:58,074 --> 00:37:02,610
of develop that problem solving
skill.Let's go into that.What

632
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,449
should be happening?Uh,Paige
should be rendering.Okay,cool.

633
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:10,985
Like,let's,why,why?Um,what does
the error.What's,let's put that

634
00:37:10,985 --> 00:37:13,445
error into Google stuff like,you
know,the,the,the,the problem

635
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:15,994
solving skills,the,the
conversations we have in our head

636
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,695
on a constant basis when we
encounter an error.Let's do that

637
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:25,085
out loud.Um,start getting a list
of like,okay,cool.What,what,what

638
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:28,894
is the narrower version of that
problem?What have we tried so

639
00:37:28,894 --> 00:37:32,644
far?How do we reproduce it?
Especially if you're working

640
00:37:32,644 --> 00:37:35,585
asynchronously,having,and we see
this a lot in like GitHub issue

641
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:38,135
templates,right?When you're
reporting an issue,like you'll

642
00:37:38,135 --> 00:37:41,974
see these things.What,like what
browser are you on?What have you

643
00:37:41,974 --> 00:37:45,094
tried,what uh,how do I reproduce
it?And sort of like narrowing

644
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:48,215
that down so you can be as
quickly helpable as possible as

645
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:50,585
well.Uh,sorry,I kind of went on a
side note there.

646
00:37:51,547 --> 00:37:52,436
Bekah: I think that's great.

647
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:56,896
Dan: Yeah.And you'll find a lot
of that in our guide that Bekah

648
00:37:56,896 --> 00:37:59,387
mentioned too,on Virtual Coffee.
Cuz you know,we,we have that help

649
00:37:59,447 --> 00:38:02,387
pairing channel and Virtual
Coffee and we have people asking

650
00:38:02,391 --> 00:38:05,416
questions all the time and
they're,they're all,you know,

651
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:09,527
it's all the same,not the same
stuff,but it's like a lot of

652
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:11,387
people in the same situation
where they're stuck on something,

653
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:16,126
you know?And you,we,we do,I mean
I think a lot of people will help

654
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:19,666
people try to ask better
questions too,you know?Um,cuz it

655
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:25,186
can help so much,you know,uh,
the.and,and it can help also

656
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:27,617
increase your likelihood of your
question getting answered

657
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:28,637
Ram贸n: Yeah.

658
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:31,487
Dan: you know,so it's like,so
you're helping the,you're helping

659
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:33,347
the people that are answering
you,but you're also like helping

660
00:38:33,347 --> 00:38:36,646
yourself right?By,by asking
better questions and things like

661
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:42,916
that.Um,my,my thing is like get
getting stuck,like the,the act of

662
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:45,226
like,ans asking those questions
and going through those thought

663
00:38:45,226 --> 00:38:50,822
patterns yourself,you know,ahead
of time.Um,For me at least half

664
00:38:50,822 --> 00:38:54,331
the time I figure the answer out
when I'm,when I'm like

665
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:57,302
formulating the question,you know
what I mean?Or I've done this,

666
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:59,911
like I've gone down,I've been,I
found,thought I found a problem

667
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:03,362
on some open source,you know,
packages that I was using and

668
00:39:03,362 --> 00:39:07,547
like.You know,figuring it out and
trying to get,like,I,you know,

669
00:39:07,547 --> 00:39:10,516
we,we've,all three of us have
maintain,have maintained open

670
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:13,246
source repository.So we know like
what,what it's like to deal with

671
00:39:13,246 --> 00:39:16,427
issues that are,uh,not good.So I
always try to do a good job on

672
00:39:16,697 --> 00:39:20,447
submitting issues,you know,but
creating a,a reproduction,things

673
00:39:20,447 --> 00:39:24,751
like that,um,for the problem.And
I get like,Way down deep into

674
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:28,021
making this,like,boiling this
down and then I figure out what

675
00:39:28,021 --> 00:39:30,512
the problem is.it's not a problem
with their package and it's a

676
00:39:30,512 --> 00:39:32,431
problem.I was using it or
something,you know,and maybe it's

677
00:39:32,431 --> 00:39:34,952
like a,actually just a
documentation error or,you know,

678
00:39:34,952 --> 00:39:38,431
issue or something like that.But
that process of like,um,

679
00:39:38,672 --> 00:39:43,152
formulating a,a well-formed
question um,can lots of times

680
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:46,382
actually like help you answer it
before you even have to hit

681
00:39:46,382 --> 00:39:51,391
submit,you know?Um,so it's a good
practice stick into,uh,for,for

682
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:52,052
many reasons.

683
00:39:52,536 --> 00:39:53,027
Ram贸n: totally.

684
00:39:54,121 --> 00:39:56,251
Bekah: and it all comes back to
that idea of being a good

685
00:39:56,251 --> 00:39:59,371
communicator,right?It doesn't
matter what you're doing.You need

686
00:39:59,371 --> 00:40:02,641
to be able to be a good
communicator,and I worry about.

687
00:40:03,811 --> 00:40:09,032
you know,I mean,a lot of people I
oh,I worry about all of the

688
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:14,101
people,um,but particularly people
who are in programs where the

689
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:17,251
goal is to get through the
program as quickly as possible,

690
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:21,481
right?Because you often don't
have time to ask those questions,

691
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:24,751
or you think it's about
memorization.And you know,even my

692
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:29,132
kids who are in US schools,the
focus,they have Iowa tests coming

693
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:32,052
up and they're like,oh,we.Hate
Iowa tests.I'm like,it doesn't

694
00:40:32,052 --> 00:40:35,021
matter.You can do really terrible
on these standardized tests and

695
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:38,831
it does not make a difference.
You,you have to go through it as

696
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:42,282
part of school,but they get
really nervous and,and what is it

697
00:40:42,282 --> 00:40:47,251
doing?It's,it's basically,
Measuring a lot of the stuff that

698
00:40:47,251 --> 00:40:51,331
you've memorized,there's not a
lot about understanding the

699
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:54,541
thought process that goes into
these things,which I think is,I

700
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:57,842
find is way more valuable.Like,
how did you get to that answer?

701
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:02,402
You know,what could you have done
to find the right answer?And so

702
00:41:02,407 --> 00:41:06,541
there's this focus on let's
memorize these things so we can

703
00:41:06,541 --> 00:41:10,686
get out,get done,and we can imply
them in a job and really,that's

704
00:41:10,686 --> 00:41:15,036
not the most valuable part of
being a developer.The most

705
00:41:15,036 --> 00:41:19,927
valuable part is being able to
communicate and to be curious,

706
00:41:19,956 --> 00:41:24,306
you were talking about earlier,
because tech is always changing.

707
00:41:24,336 --> 00:41:27,786
If you wanna memorize everything,
all the documentation for one

708
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:31,476
technology,go for it.But in a
year it's going to be different.

709
00:41:31,744 --> 00:41:36,338
Ram贸n: I,ooh,that,that,that hits
a,that hits a really,really,Big

710
00:41:36,338 --> 00:41:40,985
light bulb for me,which is like
being able to,to,I mean,first of

711
00:41:40,985 --> 00:41:45,438
all,that whole like memorization
how tough it is to communicate to

712
00:41:45,443 --> 00:41:48,498
folks that they don't have to
memorize things.Um,to,to

713
00:41:48,498 --> 00:41:52,639
understand.Like,and,and I
understand why like,it's,it's

714
00:41:52,938 --> 00:41:57,679
not,um,It's not impossible to see
why folks are,let's believe that

715
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,289
because so much of like,
especially like when we're

716
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:02,568
talking about like emerging devs
and like finding that first job

717
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:07,518
and finding that first job is
hard.Um,I'm,I'm not gonna sit

718
00:42:07,518 --> 00:42:10,938
here and say like,it gets like
exponentially easier,but getting

719
00:42:10,943 --> 00:42:14,349
the first job is probably the
toughest one.Um,because you

720
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:17,838
don't,you don't have that,you
don't have that experience.Like

721
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:20,958
you don't have that,that,that,
how do I put this?Not,not

722
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:23,259
professional experience,but like
paid,you know,paid experience to

723
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:26,449
to,to back that up.And so like a
lot of that involves,like I,and

724
00:42:26,449 --> 00:42:28,608
I've seen folks come to me and
say like,Ram贸n,do you really have

725
00:42:28,608 --> 00:42:32,389
to like be able to write an
Express JS app from scratch?And

726
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:36,798
I'm like,I don't even know if I'm
mpm installing Express.Or Express

727
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:43,699
js.Or Express js.I don't know.
Um,and,and,and,and one thing I've

728
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:48,063
learned is that,you know,I,I'm
not.I'm not a fighter per se,but

729
00:42:48,063 --> 00:42:51,333
I have,I have come to the
conclusion that what I can do is

730
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:55,684
demonstrate that you don't have
to.And so like my,my friend Jess

731
00:42:55,684 --> 00:42:59,284
and I,we run,we um,we run some
boot camps to,uh,some free boot

732
00:42:59,284 --> 00:43:02,373
camps to help folks,uh,get
started in web development or in

733
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:06,213
JavaScript.And I've got this,
I've got this moment.So these,

734
00:43:06,213 --> 00:43:09,364
these were live streamed and I
was like doing the,uh,free code

735
00:43:09,364 --> 00:43:12,003
camp exercises for and answering
questions with learners and

736
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:16,338
showing essentially how I.Like,
you know,talking out loud,by the

737
00:43:16,338 --> 00:43:21,108
way,talking out loud is such a
good debugger anyway.Um,and so I

738
00:43:21,108 --> 00:43:23,659
was doing one of these and if
you've done free code camps,uh,

739
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:26,929
free code camps,JavaScript,uh,
certification,you might remember

740
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:30,708
the record collection exercise
cuz it is,it is manipulating a

741
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,259
complex JavaScript option.I'm
talking like,like,I'm talking

742
00:43:33,259 --> 00:43:35,659
like three levels deep with a
raise in objects inside it

743
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:38,809
complex JavaScript object.And
you're supposed to write a

744
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:43,353
function to manipulate this,uh,
In a non-function way,you know

745
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:45,543
what I mean?Like you're
manipulating the object itself.

746
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:49,204
And so I'm doing this and this is
like an hour long stream,and what

747
00:43:49,204 --> 00:43:52,849
happened?I couldn't get it
working like I couldn.I was

748
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:55,789
stuck.I was massively stuck.And I
was doing like the,I'm supposed

749
00:43:55,789 --> 00:43:58,818
to do like a bunch of these,and I
have never in my life felt worse.

750
00:43:58,998 --> 00:44:01,039
I felt like I was failing.Like I
was trying not to look at the

751
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:04,009
chat,but the chat's like,oh my,
oh my goodness.What is he doing?

752
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:08,449
Uh,uh,he,I'm lost.Can we start
over?They're trying to tell me

753
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:10,869
like,oh,go to this,go to line
three,and like,look at this.I,I,

754
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:14,358
I'm so nervous.I'm like,I,I don't
even know what the number three

755
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:19,224
is.Please.Like,ah,um.and uh,I did
manage to eventually figure it

756
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:21,864
out and I fixed it and like we
fell a little bit behind.I had to

757
00:44:21,864 --> 00:44:25,224
give some extra homework.But
after I finished that stream,I

758
00:44:25,224 --> 00:44:29,784
gotta tell you,I was feeling
lousy.Um,cuz I was like,you know,

759
00:44:29,784 --> 00:44:33,264
I couldn't demos.Like,I,I
couldn't,I mis I,I felt like I

760
00:44:33,268 --> 00:44:35,273
had misled folks,but I got a
couple dms for folks and they

761
00:44:35,304 --> 00:44:39,653
were pretty consistent in saying
like,Hey Ram贸n,um,you know,

762
00:44:39,653 --> 00:44:43,193
thanks for doing the bootcamp as
always.Um,uh,that looked really

763
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:46,253
tough.Uh,don't know how I'm gonna
do it when I get to it,but I just

764
00:44:46,253 --> 00:44:49,369
wanna say like,Thank you for
showing that even someone who's

765
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:52,969
been in this for like over12
years can still get stuck,can

766
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:56,539
still struggle and can come out
through,because we forget.We

767
00:44:56,539 --> 00:45:00,739
forget that,you know,when we get
stuck on a problem and we're

768
00:45:00,744 --> 00:45:04,009
like,oh gosh,I'm never gonna
finish this.But you do eventually

769
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:07,188
figure it out either
collaboratively or by yourself.

770
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:11,478
And so like when I,when I was
able,when once I had that,there

771
00:45:11,478 --> 00:45:15,978
was like a game changing moment
for me to like realize that I can

772
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:19,864
show that.I mean,if we,if we knew
everything off by heart,we

773
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:25,880
wouldn't need documentation,you
know,so that,that,that really

774
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,780
meant the world to me.

775
00:45:27,585 --> 00:45:31,184
Dan: Yeah,that's,that's cool.And
like I,I've experienced that as

776
00:45:31,184 --> 00:45:38,414
well of,um,just,it,it's so
important to be able to like to

777
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:43,320
show that you.that people who are
like more experienced,um,still

778
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,900
get stuck,right?Because people,
you know,you assume that,you

779
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,809
assume that people that are um,
that have been doing this for a

780
00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:51,239
long time just know everything
and can handle everything and are

781
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:56,099
like,yeah,whatever.Here it is,
you know?And,um,it's obviously

782
00:45:56,099 --> 00:46:01,380
just not true you know?Um,and uh,
I just love that.I love that

783
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,320
practice of,um,you know,learning
in public and doing all that

784
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:04,679
stuff.

785
00:46:05,235 --> 00:46:08,429
Ram贸n: Yeah.This is something
that I really like about,um,

786
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,659
about live streaming in general.
Um,and that's that I,even if I

787
00:46:12,659 --> 00:46:15,989
want,I'm so bad at recorded
video,but live streaming,no prob

788
00:46:15,989 --> 00:46:19,889
like not,not to go too,too far
off topic,but I always laugh

789
00:46:19,889 --> 00:46:22,139
because like when I have to do a
two minute video,it takes me

790
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:22,769
three hours.

791
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,179
Dan: right?

792
00:46:24,269 --> 00:46:26,219
Ram贸n: Cause you're like doing
retakes and all that.Ugh.

793
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:30,480
Dan: Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah.
Right.Um,no,that's why I prefer

794
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,880
live streaming too.Uh,
unfortunately you can't like just

795
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,280
go take a walk.I guess.Maybe you
could.I suppose that might be

796
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,800
interesting but

797
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,610
Ram贸n: whole point is that it's
a,it's an open format where

798
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,469
you're just like,Hey,you know
what folks,you know,you know how

799
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:43,050
a lot of streamers,if,especially
if they're like playing games for

800
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,420
like six hours or something,
they'll just be like,they'll put

801
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:49,769
up a B R B A B right Back overlay
and just like,go get some water

802
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:51,619
or something.Or go walk through a
dog.Yeah.

803
00:46:51,824 --> 00:46:52,275
Dan: Yeah.

804
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:56,715
Bekah: And sometimes part of that
too,your chat people who are

805
00:46:56,715 --> 00:46:59,894
watching can help you navigate
that experience,right?Like they

806
00:46:59,894 --> 00:47:02,744
might have some ideas.And that's
one of the things I love too,

807
00:47:02,744 --> 00:47:05,715
because there's als often
horizontal mentorship that's

808
00:47:05,715 --> 00:47:09,704
happening in those scenarios
where somebody who might just be

809
00:47:09,704 --> 00:47:14,295
starting out knows the next
question to ask something that

810
00:47:14,295 --> 00:47:17,085
you've forgotten or something
that you wouldn't have thought

811
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:20,655
of.And so then everybody can kind
of participate and you can all

812
00:47:20,655 --> 00:47:21,164
support each other.

813
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,257
Ram贸n: Totally.

814
00:47:23,117 --> 00:47:27,742
Dan: I do find it difficult
personally,too.When live

815
00:47:27,742 --> 00:47:29,902
streaming and when you're in that
position where you're just kind

816
00:47:29,902 --> 00:47:35,121
of stuck and trying to figure
things out.The I don't know.This

817
00:47:35,121 --> 00:47:38,152
is,this is like an experience,
like very specific to live

818
00:47:38,157 --> 00:47:43,072
streaming.Right.Um,but I,I,I have
a hard time like getting my brain

819
00:47:43,077 --> 00:47:45,981
to,if I'm really trying to figure
something out,but then like

820
00:47:45,981 --> 00:47:49,492
people are talking and I'm.
Trying to read their comments and

821
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:51,291
see what they're like,understand
what they're saying while my

822
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:53,032
brain is still churning on
whatever the thing is that I'm

823
00:47:53,032 --> 00:47:55,942
stuck on.You know,I've only been
in that,in that boat where I just

824
00:47:55,947 --> 00:47:57,952
like,like you said,like,yeah,I
don't even know what numbers are

825
00:47:57,952 --> 00:48:04,911
anymore,Like,I'm,I'm so stuck
right now.Um,but I think that's,

826
00:48:04,972 --> 00:48:07,132
I think that's,you know,that's
kind of specific to live

827
00:48:07,132 --> 00:48:08,211
streaming it,you know?

828
00:48:08,632 --> 00:48:11,838
Bekah: I,it's part of the
experience,right?And I think that

829
00:48:11,867 --> 00:48:15,288
even whether you're live
streaming and you get distracted

830
00:48:15,288 --> 00:48:20,688
by the chat,or I'm at my desk and
I get distracted by a snack or

831
00:48:20,693 --> 00:48:23,418
something,like,there's always
something that can take us

832
00:48:23,538 --> 00:48:27,347
outside of that process.And I
think that's often an indication

833
00:48:27,347 --> 00:48:31,007
of like,okay,take a step back,
take a reset,and you can do that

834
00:48:31,007 --> 00:48:34,793
at any time.In live streaming,it
can be helpful to have somebody

835
00:48:34,793 --> 00:48:38,362
else around who can be the
navigator for the chat.If you

836
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:42,713
feel like,okay,that's something
that I get distracted by,and it's

837
00:48:42,717 --> 00:48:46,432
all to say that there's lots of
different ways of doing things,

838
00:48:46,463 --> 00:48:50,822
of communicating,of debugging,of
learning and growing and finding

839
00:48:50,922 --> 00:48:55,402
the right thing that works for
you is a really important part of

840
00:48:55,402 --> 00:48:56,123
the process.

841
00:48:56,775 --> 00:49:02,340
Ram贸n: Absolutely.And.You know,I
find,I find that,um,this is why

842
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,951
like before I started live
streaming,like I'm a big believer

843
00:49:04,951 --> 00:49:07,621
in,uh,you know,you don't have to
do things just because

844
00:49:07,621 --> 00:49:11,760
everybody's doing them.Um,so,you
know,if you try out live

845
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,650
streaming and you find it's not
for you,but you still wanna try

846
00:49:13,655 --> 00:49:16,380
this sort of like learning in
public kind of thing.Like,one

847
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,811
thing that I was doing prior to
the pandemic a lot and a little

848
00:49:18,811 --> 00:49:24,391
bit during the pandemic as well,
was,uh,what I call the study.But

849
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,871
what my friend Jon Ash taught me
eventually is called formally

850
00:49:27,871 --> 00:49:31,440
called a community of practice,
which I really,I like that term.

851
00:49:31,831 --> 00:49:36,061
And what it is,is,uh,sort of a
meetup.Uh,I think in some places

852
00:49:36,065 --> 00:49:38,490
you'll see them called like
Coffee and code.They,they've got

853
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:41,340
different names.Like I used to go
to one for Rust called,uh,rust,

854
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:47,400
uh,Rustin Learn.Um,um,that was,
uh,online based in Berlin.And

855
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,931
really what it really was is just
like you meet up with some

856
00:49:49,931 --> 00:49:53,161
people.and you just code on
whatever you can collab if you

857
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:55,440
want,but you're just like around
each other coding on stuff or

858
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,221
like working on a side project or
you know,doing whatever and when

859
00:49:59,221 --> 00:50:02,190
you need some help or,or if you
wanna like show off something,

860
00:50:02,195 --> 00:50:04,440
you'd be like,hold up,let me get
on the projector for a second and

861
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,286
show y'all.Like,let me show y'all
what I'm working on.And.What I l

862
00:50:09,315 --> 00:50:11,596
and,and,and I think for me it
really emphasizes that

863
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:14,175
collaborative aspect of,of
learning what you were talking

864
00:50:14,175 --> 00:50:17,385
about earlier,back about like,
uh,horizontal mentorship.Like I'm

865
00:50:17,385 --> 00:50:20,806
a big,big,big believer that
mentor,like the distinction I

866
00:50:20,806 --> 00:50:24,405
make between teaching and
mentorship is that a lot of the

867
00:50:24,405 --> 00:50:28,275
time don't wanna generalize.Um,
teaching when,when teaching,I

868
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:31,996
feel like knowledge mostly flows,
uh,in one direction,teacher to

869
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:34,846
students.Whereas with mentorship,
it tends to be a lot muddier than

870
00:50:34,846 --> 00:50:37,860
that.It can go both ways.It can
go in other way,like you said,

871
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,650
horizontally,like you said,Bekah
and,and that's something that I

872
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:42,300
find really invigo.

873
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:46,201
Bekah: Yeah,I really love that
and I think that that's kind of a

874
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:50,610
good way to conclude our episode
today because so much of what we

875
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:55,050
talked about stems on that idea
of being curious,having those

876
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:58,831
conversations,being a good
communicator,and,and I really

877
00:50:58,835 --> 00:51:03,751
love the idea that you mentioned
before of how to wait.I wrote it

878
00:51:03,751 --> 00:51:08,161
down.How to make yourself as
palpable as possible,which I

879
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,820
might just steal for the title of
this episode,because

880
00:51:11,865 --> 00:51:12,315
Ram贸n: Oh,

881
00:51:12,811 --> 00:51:17,101
Bekah: that,that's key,right?
That's essentially a huge part of

882
00:51:17,101 --> 00:51:17,880
this journey.

883
00:51:18,429 --> 00:51:22,119
Ram贸n: I agree.I agree.And I
find,I find that,um,not to

884
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:24,338
diverge too much,uh,from that,
cuz I know we're wrapping up,

885
00:51:24,338 --> 00:51:28,159
but,you know,I,uh,being on the
receiving end of that,how

886
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:33,528
important listening is.Um,And I
mean,listening strategically.For

887
00:51:33,528 --> 00:51:36,079
example,uh,one of the things I
always emphasize when I'm

888
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,378
dealing,when I'm working with
somebody and,uh,let's say they're

889
00:51:39,378 --> 00:51:42,318
showing me a solution that,and
they want to make sure that it's

890
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:45,559
okay with me or,or that,that it's
good to merge and they're

891
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:48,139
explaining the solution to me and
I don't agree with it one bit,

892
00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:50,679
and I'm like,no,no.And my,and my
head,and I'm screaming like,no,

893
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:53,838
no,no,no,no.We need to rewrite
this.We need to use a functional

894
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:59,028
solution or something.How
important it is to let that all

895
00:51:59,028 --> 00:52:03,844
be.Sounded out,you know,like
said,said out loud by,by the

896
00:52:03,844 --> 00:52:06,543
mentee and just be like,explain,
like showing and explaining the

897
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:09,514
solution to me.Cuz a couple
things might happen.And this is

898
00:52:09,514 --> 00:52:13,954
something that I really love,
which is either by being a

899
00:52:13,954 --> 00:52:16,744
proverbial rubber duck,you know,
like rubber duck programming

900
00:52:16,923 --> 00:52:20,943
where you explain something to,
to,to,to anani object by being a

901
00:52:20,943 --> 00:52:26,824
proverbial RobotC to,to the
mentee.They might,by explaining

902
00:52:26,824 --> 00:52:30,378
it,be like,oh,hold on,now that I
say it out loud.This isn't that

903
00:52:30,378 --> 00:52:33,498
great a solution,how about we try
this?And I was like,sure,let's

904
00:52:33,498 --> 00:52:38,628
try it.Um,and I let they,they did
all of that by themselves and I

905
00:52:38,628 --> 00:52:44,028
think that's so empowering.Or,
uh,I might realize that I was

906
00:52:44,028 --> 00:52:48,318
wrong cuz I'm human.I make
mistakes.Maybe their solution is

907
00:52:48,349 --> 00:52:51,199
just absolutely fine.And just
because it's not the way I

908
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:53,389
would've done it doesn't mean
it's wrong.It's just different

909
00:52:53,568 --> 00:52:59,539
and it still fits the code base
or it incites a convers.um,yeah,

910
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:02,329
sorry,didn't wanna take us too
far off topic.

911
00:53:02,338 --> 00:53:05,208
Dan: No,I,I think that's great.
And I've had that experience too,

912
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:08,088
of trying to help.Through it and
being like,this is wrong.This is

913
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:11,119
like,in my head,this is like,
this is totally wrong.I never,

914
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,028
you know,no,don't do this.And
then talking through it.

915
00:53:14,028 --> 00:53:17,809
Actually,I end up coming around
to there.Point of view,you know,

916
00:53:18,168 --> 00:53:20,989
like under,you know,so that,
that,like listening is,is such an

917
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:24,469
important skill.Um,and it's,it's
worth talking through.Um,all that

918
00:53:24,469 --> 00:53:27,798
stuff.I,that's,that's for
anybody,that's for mentors or

919
00:53:27,798 --> 00:53:31,068
anybody,even,even if you're on
the same thing and doing a poll

920
00:53:31,068 --> 00:53:34,159
request on somebody or,uh,you
know,uh,peer review on somebody

921
00:53:34,164 --> 00:53:37,969
else's work.Um,just keeping that
like open mind and,and then like

922
00:53:38,268 --> 00:53:41,208
trying to listen to what they.As
opposed,you know,instead of

923
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:44,599
interjecting your own opinion and
thoughts on top,uh,right away,

924
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:46,699
you know,try to understand what
their thought process was first,

925
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:49,248
because sometimes there's gonna
be stuff you're gonna miss,um,

926
00:53:49,728 --> 00:53:53,929
that you didn't think of,you
know,and,uh,I dunno,it's very

927
00:53:53,929 --> 00:53:57,168
valuable.So I agree
wholeheartedly with that advice.

928
