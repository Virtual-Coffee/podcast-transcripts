00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:11,509
Bekah: Hello and welcome to
Season seven,episode five of the

2
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:16,966
Virtual Coffee Podcast.I'm Bekah,
and this is a podcast that

3
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:21,045
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community.Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:21,045 --> 00:00:23,806
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:26,356
coding journey,and they're here
on this podcast sharing their

6
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:29,025
stories and what they've learned,
and we are here to share it with

7
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:31,486
you.Here with me today is my
co-host.

8
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:34,185
Dan: What up,Beck?How's it going?

9
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,301
Bekah: It is fantastic.How's it
going with you?

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,201
Dan: It's going pretty good.
Yeah,I've had probably too much

11
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:43,081
coffee this morning,but other
than that,feeling pretty good.

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,960
Bekah: Nice.

13
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:48,901
Dan: And so today we have another
awesome,interview with another

14
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:53,201
awesome member of Virtual Coffee.
We're talking to Rebecca Key,uh,

15
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:57,881
who is a software engineer based
out of Atlanta,Georgia.Rebecca

16
00:00:57,911 --> 00:01:01,511
had a really cool story.She was
actually an organic chemist for

17
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:04,990
years.She has her PhD,so I'm
sorry.I should have said Dr.

18
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,501
Rebecca Key.I meant to do that
earlier.And,uh,she,so she was an

19
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,661
organic chemist,did that for a
long time,worked in a lab,all

20
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:14,350
that stuff.And then,um,around the
Covid times,I think,uh,

21
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:17,320
transitioned to being a
developer,which I think a lot of

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,831
our career changer people,did
that during that time.Uh,you

23
00:01:20,835 --> 00:01:24,990
know,sort of a tumultuous time
for everybody and um,yeah,it was

24
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,471
really good talking to.

25
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:28,995
Bekah: Yeah,it was really cool to
talk about that transition and

26
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:32,415
then also bringing her hobbies
into things.She talked a lot

27
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:36,225
about her experience with her ham
radio,which I thought was really

28
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:40,066
cool,and I really love getting to
know like all of the sides of the

29
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:44,055
people who come to the podcast.
So I,I think that we got to

30
00:01:44,055 --> 00:01:47,296
explore a lot of different
aspects of what it is to be a

31
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:47,656
person.

32
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:49,771
Dan: Yeah,absolutely.

33
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:52,206
Bekah: Well,we start every
episode of the podcast,like we

34
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:56,406
start every Virtual Coffee.We say
our names,where we're from,what

35
00:01:56,411 --> 00:02:00,936
we do,and a random check-in
question.We hope you enjoy this

36
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:15,024
episode.Today's random check-in
question is,what's one fun fact

37
00:02:15,144 --> 00:02:23,377
that you know.So one fun fact
that I know is that possums have

38
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:30,217
13nipples and they go in a circle
with the13th,one in the middle.

39
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:32,211
Dan: can't be real

40
00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:36,516
Bekah: It is.I looked it up.I,
and this like a side note,I was

41
00:02:36,516 --> 00:02:39,396
at a conference once and they
were giving out drink tickets and

42
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:42,276
they were like,tell us a fun
fact.And I told them that Fun

43
00:02:42,276 --> 00:02:45,007
fact.And they were like,well,we
meant about yourself,but that

44
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:47,937
will work too.Cool.

45
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:54,542
Dan: yeah,you just broke my
brain.I,that's kind of thing a,a

46
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:58,831
child would draw,would draw Um,
Hey,do you want to do the rest of

47
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:01,262
the intro?Or you just like,Like
your

48
00:03:01,336 --> 00:03:04,967
Bekah: dang I just got really
excited about the question.Screw

49
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:10,336
this all up.My name is Bekah.I am
a technical community builder

50
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:14,146
from a small town in Ohio,and
there's also an animal that

51
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:18,497
poops,um,in squares,but I can't
remember which one it is.Who

52
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:20,222
Dan: that one I knew it's a
wombat,right?

53
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:22,157
Bekah: Yes,wombat.I know that.

54
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:27,092
Dan: I knew.that one.Uh,that is,
uh,yeah,that is the talent.I've

55
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:30,093
always been jealous of,you know,
like,that seems like a,a.a,a cool

56
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:30,574
ability,

57
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,968
Bekah: Do you know why they poop
in squares?

58
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:36,693
Dan: Um,I don't know for sure.My
guess is something about rolling

59
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:38,163
downhills,but I don't actually
know.

60
00:03:38,748 --> 00:03:40,818
Bekah: Yeah,it's to mark
territory so it wouldn't roll

61
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:45,229
down hills.They needed to have
square poop.So they made it

62
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:45,639
happen.

63
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:53,675
Dan: uh,nature is a miracle.uh,
okay.Hi,I'm Dan.Um,Yeah.

64
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:59,645
Cleveland aisle computery things.
Um,let's see.Fun fact.Okay,

65
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:02,655
Bekah: you gonna get on me for my
intro?And you say computery

66
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:02,944
things.

67
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:11,495
Dan: well,I said something,you
know,uh,okay.Um,there are,uh,

68
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:19,535
let's see,broccoli,uh,
cauliflower,kale,something else.

69
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:26,045
all are,um,all are related and
oh,Brussels sprouts,um,and come

70
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:29,105
from the same plant,and they're
all human made.So the,this one

71
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:34,444
plant humans,uh,like took this
plant and then selected for,you

72
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:37,295
know,flowers and made cauliflower
and selected for something else.

73
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:39,665
I,I don't really know all the
genetics,but like all of those

74
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:41,855
plants don't come from nature.
They come from,they come from

75
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:46,444
human,uh,you know,like plant,I
don't know what you call it,gene

76
00:04:46,444 --> 00:04:49,139
manipulation,but,not in a
chemistry lab.

77
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:52,798
Bekah: So why do they choose all
the bitter things and,and not

78
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:54,598
like chocolate

79
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,778
Dan: I think the plant was
bitter.I,I don't think they

80
00:04:57,778 --> 00:04:58,079
could,

81
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:00,629
Bekah: Yeah.But why would you say
like,I'm gonna take this bitter

82
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:04,423
plant and make more bitter plants
out of it.Like,

83
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:06,269
Dan: well,some people like bitter
plants.

84
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:08,173
Bekah: I mean,I also enjoy eating
all of

85
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:09,658
Dan: I do too,right?

86
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:10,603
Bekah: like

87
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:12,988
Dan: But they're,and they're
different like the,you know,like

88
00:05:12,988 --> 00:05:16,649
you can.broccoli and cauliflower,
that makes those like,kind of

89
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:21,988
look similar,uh,except for the
color,but like the,uh,yeah,kale

90
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,259
and,and I don't know if asparagus
is in there.

91
00:05:25,814 --> 00:05:27,553
Bekah: doesn't it come from the
mustard seed?

92
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:28,619
Dan: I don't

93
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:28,869
Bekah: Sorry.

94
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:32,535
Dan: I have no idea.I mean it
comes from some kind of a seed

95
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:35,303
cuz it's a.I don't,I don't
remember what the,I should work

96
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:38,694
on this fun fact so that I can
actually say it,you know,uh,uh,

97
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:42,726
for drink tickets.apparently But,
uh,yeah,that's my,that's a fir

98
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:44,797
first fun fact that popped into
my brain,so I'm going with that.

99
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:48,514
Rebecca: My name is Rebecca.I am
a software engineer based out of

100
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,055
Atlanta,Georgia.And a fun fact,
one of the first ones that's

101
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:57,274
coming to my mind is from an.Old
school email chain.And I remember

102
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,944
it's apparently impossible to
lick your elbow.

103
00:06:00,324 --> 00:06:01,555
Dan: like nobody can do it.

104
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:04,029
Bekah: Does kids have tried?
Yeah.

105
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,045
Rebecca: And then according to
the,you know,the email chain are

106
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,345
further down,it's like a certain
number of people are going to try

107
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:14,245
to lick their elbow after reading
this But,um,I don't know if that,

108
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:19,194
um,myth has been debunked or not,
but,um,apparently it's tough or

109
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:22,735
too impossible to do.Get to

110
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,079
Dan: wanna

111
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:26,154
Bekah: It wanna try.

112
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:27,759
Dan: Everybody at Try right now.

113
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:31,855
Bekah: don't do,you can't do that
thing,then I am usually gonna try

114
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:36,024
it.But in the circumstance,I,I'm
not gonna try it in front people.

115
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:38,964
After we're done recording,I will
try to lick my elbow

116
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:42,985
Dan: Oh fine.Uh,yeah,I wonder if
there's like the,you know,the

117
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:47,904
people that can do the,the like
crazy,you know,I don't know what

118
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:52,134
you call it.Um,or they can beat
super bendy and stuff,you know?

119
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:56,935
Uh,yeah.Yeah.I wonder if there's
something like that,you know,or

120
00:06:57,228 --> 00:07:02,343
there was,who was it?In Lethal
Weapon,the guy Rig.What is,I

121
00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:05,134
forget what the actor's name is,
but he had a trick,he had a

122
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:08,043
trick,a trick shoulder where he
could pop it out,you know,like in

123
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,533
like he used it to get out of,
you know,bad situations.But I

124
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:14,047
wonder if he could pop it out and
then like turn his arm around,

125
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:17,254
All right,if you have a trick
shoulder,I want to hear from you

126
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,394
to let us know.

127
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:24,048
Bekah: That's right.Send us,send
us some messages.Podcast Virtual

128
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:27,048
Coffee.io.Right?We have that
email address.

129
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:28,744
Dan: Oh yeah,definitely.

130
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:31,788
Bekah: Send us all your feedback
and fun stories.We're here for

131
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:35,964
them.and speaking of fun stories,
we have Rebecca Key here with us

132
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:40,074
today and oh,we are very
thankful.So thank you for being

133
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:42,235
here.We're very excited to hear
your story.

134
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,113
Rebecca: Thank you again for
having me so.Um,as I mentioned

135
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:50,704
before,I'm a software engineer.
Um,I come to tech after many

136
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:55,564
years in being in science,um,
specifically organic chemistry.I

137
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:59,463
served in many roles over the
years in research labs,being a

138
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:03,514
laboratory technician all the way
up to a research director in the

139
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:08,891
pet care industry.And,um,from
there like.being an r d director

140
00:08:08,896 --> 00:08:12,232
that was in the height of the
pandemic.So,you know,with the

141
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:15,928
world shut down,everyone kind of,
or some people,you know,paused.

142
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,619
It's like,okay,you know,where am
I at?Where am I going?Where do I

143
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:25,199
wanna go?And I had.Made solid
contributions in my role,and what

144
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,759
I wanted to do was be able to use
my problem solving skillset to be

145
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,028
able to make a broader impact.
And when I say broader impact

146
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:37,438
with software engineering,namely
front end development,which I

147
00:08:37,438 --> 00:08:42,158
spend most of my time doing,you
have.A pretty quick feedback loop

148
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:48,369
on your work.Like in science,it
can be an order of years from an

149
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:53,558
idea from inception to completion
to any sort of publication.And

150
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:58,839
within that,your lab experiments
can,you know,last from days to

151
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:05,234
weeks.Again,where I hit refresh
on a UI and I immediately,again,

152
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:09,073
know where I'm going and a wrong
answer is at least an answer to

153
00:09:09,073 --> 00:09:13,724
get me back on the right track
and I can do that quickly.Um,

154
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:17,384
hopefully not taking a matter of
days,years,et cetera.You gotta

155
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:21,433
get,get help along before that
comes along.So that's what

156
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:25,744
brought me to the field.I started
working with,a fitness-based web

157
00:09:25,744 --> 00:09:30,955
app that.I started,um,race prep
Fit.I'm hoping to get that

158
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:35,355
eventually is a,um,subscription
service.the premise of it is

159
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:41,384
having users customize their
training program to meet goals

160
00:09:41,384 --> 00:09:45,794
for an event of their choice.Um,
I've also,beyond that,have done

161
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:50,955
some independent contract work,
um,most recently with Dan.Um,UI

162
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:55,335
elements in React,and it was a
really neat experience where,you

163
00:09:55,335 --> 00:10:00,375
know,I'm a,I'm a React developer
more than anything else in tech,

164
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,875
but I was able to learn more
frameworks in React versus just

165
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:08,565
the Create React app where I
started.So it was,you know,neat

166
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,924
being able to use Storybook,you
know,getting familiar with remix

167
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:15,346
and even dabbling a little bit in
type script,which I had been

168
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,590
wanting to do,and that gave me a
reason.To work on that.Done some

169
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,080
other freelance work where I'm,
you know,building static

170
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,539
websites.Companies billing a
landing page,getting a form ready

171
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,590
for people to subscribe to the
company's email list.Um,I've

172
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,370
actually most,most recently
started diving into content

173
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:40,259
creation,reviving my blog for
hand,radio Adventures,RF Quest.

174
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:45,269
Um,alongside that,um,I'm editing
a video of where I built a40

175
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,440
meter antenna in my backyard.Um,
hopefully hoping to get that on

176
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,565
YouTube here in the next few
days.So,You know,definitely

177
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:58,695
keeping myself busy with things
like that.And also with working

178
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:04,514
with the ham radio,I'm able to
keep my speaking and writing

179
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:07,004
skills up to snuff because
unfortunately that is a very

180
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:10,695
perishable skill set,and it's so
important no matter what field

181
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:13,514
you go into,to be able to
communicate,whether it's,you

182
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:21,855
know,speaking or.And then also
with radio,I'm able to,um,do

183
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:25,304
different contesting,um,parks on
the air is something that we've

184
00:11:25,304 --> 00:11:28,605
been doing more recently where it
gets us out of the house.We set

185
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:32,384
up radios at different,you know,
state parks,wildlife management

186
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:37,154
areas.Um,Public fishing areas,
and if you can get more than10

187
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:42,105
contacts on radio,you've
activated the park.Um,also within

188
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:45,134
some of these state parks,you've
got,you know,mountain biking

189
00:11:45,134 --> 00:11:48,315
trails on some of them.There's
hiking trails.You can go paddle

190
00:11:48,315 --> 00:11:52,830
boats.So it really.You know,it
encourages us to get out of the

191
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,250
house,you know,with,um,remote
work is great,but you do have to

192
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,580
make an effort to,you know,
separate yourself so you can

193
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,629
recharge and then,you know,be the
best you can be.Um,even with the

194
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:07,740
exercising I do,I'm running in
the neighborhood,I'm,I got a

195
00:12:07,745 --> 00:12:10,379
power rack in my living room,so
I'll weightlift in my living

196
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:14,220
room.I didn't crochet in my
living room,so this is a really,

197
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:20,009
um,great way to get out of the
neighborhood.You know,talk to

198
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:24,000
people through technology.It may
not be coding,but it's definitely

199
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,389
hitting that science and
technology check mark.That's been

200
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:28,470
a consistent in my life.

201
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,929
Bekah: I really loved it.

202
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,120
Dan: Yeah.I,I love it too.Sorry,
Bekah.I,I think we're both

203
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,019
excited about it though.It,it's,
it's such a cool idea.Um,I have

204
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:44,090
like so many questions about the
hand radio stuff.I,um,so the,the

205
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:45,980
program,what is the program
called?With the parks?

206
00:12:46,414 --> 00:12:50,745
Rebecca: It's called Parks on the
Air or POTA.Um,there's also SOTA

207
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:55,115
Summits on the air where you can,
you know,hike or mountain bike up

208
00:12:55,144 --> 00:12:59,855
a mountain.That's a designated
summit for the program.There's a

209
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,065
lot of them in North Georgia
that's relatively locally.For

210
00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:09,196
that one,you have to make four
uh,contacts,um,to activate the.

211
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:13,414
So that one's a little different.
There's a big prize on that one.

212
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:17,014
Um,I think it,I think it's a
hundred contacts in a year.Um,

213
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,794
ham radio,sodium enthusiasts,
correct me if I'm wrong,but it's

214
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:25,024
the Mountain Goat Award and
that's a really,um,big one to

215
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:28,924
get.Um,we met someone not that
long ago that,um,did it on two

216
00:13:28,924 --> 00:13:32,164
meters,which is more of a local
line of sight band.So that was

217
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:34,745
definitely a challenge added to
that as well.

218
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:40,119
Dan: Nice.so you built a big
antenna in your yard,is it the

219
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,058
same,are you using the same radio
like at home and when you're

220
00:13:43,058 --> 00:13:46,149
traveling?Or do you have,like,is
there a smaller one or,you know,

221
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:49,884
Rebecca: so this particular one,
um,this antenna is actually just

222
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:55,823
a long,um,about61feet of wire for
this particular one.This one was

223
00:13:56,283 --> 00:14:01,254
actually made in mind,um,to take
with us for portable ops.

224
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:03,909
Dan: Oh wow.The one in your
backyard.

225
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:09,115
Rebecca: Um,there are some in the
backyard for,um,the,the home unit

226
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:09,715
that's,

227
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,980
Dan: Yeah,there's a hill unit.
Yeah.Yeah,that's what I,that's

228
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,500
what I was like,yeah.So how heavy
is the,how heavy is the one where

229
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,320
you are taking it to parks and
you know,mountains and stuff?

230
00:14:18,144 --> 00:14:21,205
Rebecca: so,uh,the one we take is
probably just a couple of pounds.

231
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:23,455
I mean,you've gotta take,you
know,the batteries as well with

232
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:26,034
it.Um,I always have to make sure
to charge those beforehand so you

233
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:31,134
can actually use radio.I mean,
antenna's pretty lightweight.Um,

234
00:14:31,764 --> 00:14:35,934
real easy to work with.The brand
that we built this antenna with,

235
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:39,565
um,it's called SOTA Beams.They
actually,it's a company that kind

236
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:43,764
of has the SOTA contesting in
mind,for people to just be able

237
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:44,904
to easily transport it.

238
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:50,809
Dan: That's so cool.it reminds me
of,of,um,well,I guess Pokemon Go

239
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:54,313
now.there was a game called
Ingress before that was that,you

240
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:58,349
know,the people who made Pokemon
Go,uh,ingress first,you know,and

241
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:00,778
then they basically kind of
rebranded it.But the thing that I

242
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:02,879
loved the most about it was,it
was that same thing,right?Where

243
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:05,818
there's like,there are goals and
stuff,but it,you have to,you have

244
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:09,538
to travel around.Like,it not
maybe as,I mean,you,you can

245
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:12,418
choose how much you go,you know,
but you get rewarded for going

246
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:14,879
new places and,you know,
exploring new places and,and

247
00:15:14,884 --> 00:15:18,802
stuff like that.It's,it's really
neat.I love those,combinations

248
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:23,782
of,you know,technology and,and,
Forcing you to get away from just

249
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:26,241
sitting at your computer or your
phone or whatever,you know?Cuz

250
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:28,792
lots of times when you think of
that kind of stuff,for me at

251
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:32,782
least,I end up just sitting on my
computer you know,doing neat

252
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:35,542
stuff,but like,still just,just
sitting here,you know?So I love

253
00:15:35,547 --> 00:15:39,322
that.I love anything that helps
you,helps you,um,you know,

254
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:41,991
rewards you for getting out,uh,
into the world,

255
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:44,932
Rebecca: For sure,even locally,
it's nice to have a good little

256
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:47,961
change of scenery when you need
it,and some of these state parks

257
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:50,822
are within about30minutes from
where we live,so that's not too

258
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:51,501
bad of a drive.

259
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:52,386
Dan: Nice.

260
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,789
Bekah: I think it's interesting
cuz you've talked a lot about how

261
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:59,330
we touch on technology in our
lives,like outside of the coding,

262
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:02,899
uh,but how impactful that it
could still be,how it can still

263
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:06,769
create connections for us and how
you.Are kind of utilizing your

264
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,830
interest to be able to do that.
And so you talked a little bit

265
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,909
about this app that you're
creating,that you want it to move

266
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:16,850
into a subscription service,
which sounds like it's,it's

267
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:22,009
filling that need as well.So did
that get started as a project

268
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,690
personally for you or to help you
learn and,you know,how have you

269
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,259
kind of,how has that developed
throughout your skillset

270
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:31,799
development as.

271
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:34,663
Rebecca: So it was kind of a
little bit of everything.It was

272
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:40,394
kind of my first foray into
learning React.Um,I've been in

273
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:45,313
probably a consistent runner,
probably f.Within the last10

274
00:16:45,313 --> 00:16:49,335
years,I've been running on an off
since I was14.it's something that

275
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:54,047
is a great form of exercise
because it's readily available

276
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:58,427
and easy to do.The best forms of
exercise are ones you can do,and

277
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:02,476
if figured it would keep me
motivated to keep running,it

278
00:17:02,476 --> 00:17:07,906
would,you know,get me going and
react.But also kind of think of a

279
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:13,217
way of.Okay.What can be,what con
contributions can you make that

280
00:17:13,217 --> 00:17:15,916
aren't already out there?And
that's kind of like in chemistry

281
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:20,987
as well.You're doing research on
something that's entirely new or

282
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:24,767
you're finding a new twist on
something that's already there,

283
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,646
or you're building on,you know,
something else.Just showing

284
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:32,567
something new and.You know,what I
was hoping for to show,um,

285
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:35,836
something new with this is to be
able to have something where a

286
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:40,636
user can customize a training
plan as opposed to something

287
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,846
where it's like,okay,I ran three
miles today.Which that's great

288
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:47,866
that those things do have their
purpose,but you know,someone

289
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:53,685
wants a little bit more than
just,you know,logging miles.This

290
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:57,435
is a way to say,okay,I wanna
train in this manner.This run's

291
00:17:57,435 --> 00:18:01,605
gonna be a temper run.This run's
gonna be at pace.Or you're kinda

292
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:03,645
log where you run at intervals
and things like that.If you're

293
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:07,155
doing speed work for example,it
kinda gives,kinda opens some

294
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:11,685
doors to having a little more
data and you know,is a somebody

295
00:18:11,685 --> 00:18:16,365
who's spent my career handling
data telling stories.That's also

296
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:20,895
kind of something that appealed
to,um,working on a more of a

297
00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:21,526
fitness based.

298
00:18:22,382 --> 00:18:25,442
Bekah: I think that's really
great.I had used,uh,like a

299
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:30,511
handful of years ago,couch to5K
or,or whatever it was.Um,and it's

300
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:32,882
pretty straightforward,right?
Like everybody has the same

301
00:18:32,882 --> 00:18:37,372
workouts I think every day.And
then I found,When I started

302
00:18:37,372 --> 00:18:42,051
getting back into running about a
year ago that I wanted to

303
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:47,152
improve,but I didn't really know
how to,because there's,at least I

304
00:18:47,152 --> 00:18:50,182
couldn't really find anything out
there.So that idea of like what

305
00:18:50,182 --> 00:18:55,211
you are talking about,that kind
of,um,customization,different

306
00:18:55,571 --> 00:19:01,301
kinds of running.Workouts or
whatever is really appealing

307
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:04,602
because it,I,I know I pretty much
know nothing about running.Oh,I

308
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:08,321
can't run now cause I tore the
meniscus in my knee.But one day

309
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:14,021
when I,when I get back there,
that idea of improving my speed

310
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:19,182
is something that I'd like to
focus on.And finding the

311
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:24,942
application of data to do that is
a really interesting concept.I.

312
00:19:25,846 --> 00:19:30,616
Rebecca: For sure is,is going
well,and I'm looking forward to

313
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:33,916
seeing your,where it goes,where
it takes me,and all of that.

314
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:36,566
Bekah: It sounds like you're
doing a lot of different things,

315
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:41,786
right?You,you've got,um,a lot of
hobbies and activities and you're

316
00:19:41,786 --> 00:19:46,405
doing contract work and you're
doing this.How do you.Balance or

317
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:49,766
not balance,all of the different
things that you're working on.

318
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:53,300
Rebecca: So,um,I have to
prioritize,you know,basically

319
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:58,671
with deadlines.Um,some things are
a little more pressing,need to be

320
00:19:58,671 --> 00:20:02,540
done a little faster.So those
things I do,you know,prioritize.

321
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:06,151
first there's some things,
depending on what needs to be

322
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:11,355
done with it.I take more time to.
Dedicate to that.But what I try

323
00:20:11,355 --> 00:20:14,596
to do big picture,you know,I have
my written list of things I do

324
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:18,454
need to do.and,you know,try to,
you know,give,prioritize,you

325
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:22,474
know,stuff that's needs to be
done sooner,that needs more time.

326
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:26,255
Um,take,you know,take those first
and then if there's something

327
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:30,305
that can wait,you know,that kind
of gets put to the bottom of the

328
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:34,444
list.um,you know,try to big
picture,you know,try to

329
00:20:34,444 --> 00:20:37,444
multitask.But there,if there's
something that,you know,needs my

330
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:41,464
attention a little more,you know,
briefly,you know,put some other

331
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,525
things aside,get the priority
done.And what I also do,and I did

332
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:48,994
this in science as well,um,I'm a
note taker.I'm hardcore pen and

333
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:53,075
paper.But if you,if I get to the
end of something around at a good

334
00:20:53,075 --> 00:20:58,924
stopping point,I will make notes
of what I need to do next when I

335
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,525
come back to it.Because sometimes
you get taken away from something

336
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:07,295
longer than you want to,and
having that cue of what you've

337
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:11,615
done and what you need to get
back to is a way where I.

338
00:21:12,724 --> 00:21:16,234
Ideally,you know,minimize time,
just scrambling,trying to figure

339
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:20,884
out what I did,going behind
myself.So that's kind of a,a,a,

340
00:21:20,884 --> 00:21:25,204
um,tool that I've had for many
years that I carry with me if it

341
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:27,904
serves me pretty well in tech as
far as,you know,getting caught

342
00:21:27,904 --> 00:21:30,934
back up to speed on something
that I haven't touched,maybe in a

343
00:21:30,934 --> 00:21:31,025
bit.

344
00:21:32,355 --> 00:21:36,589
Dan: I think that's,I think
that's such a great idea.I.I

345
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:40,339
struggle with the problem that
you have solved And,you know,I,

346
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:42,500
you know,and,and for me lots of
times it's like,okay,well I'm

347
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,609
just gonna leave these four,you
know,14tabs open and,you know,

348
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,970
hopefully they're still open when
I come back to them and I can

349
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,820
decode what I was thinking.You
know,something like that.I,I,

350
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,549
the,uh,it doesn't work that well.
I mean,it sometimes works,it's

351
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:59,809
sometimes not.Um,and,and I think,
you know,when you're independent,

352
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:03,508
like,like you are,You don't have,
you know,you don't have a,a

353
00:22:03,508 --> 00:22:05,698
manager like telling you all the
different things and stuff and

354
00:22:06,178 --> 00:22:10,646
that sort of ability to
prioritize and quickly,quickly

355
00:22:10,646 --> 00:22:15,277
change context.You know,I,it's
such a valuable skill and,and I,

356
00:22:15,277 --> 00:22:17,426
I feel like you have,I feel like
you've figured a lot of that

357
00:22:17,426 --> 00:22:20,696
stuff out.It's really cool to
hear.I'm al also also very

358
00:22:20,696 --> 00:22:23,366
jealous.A all time with people
who,who can take notes and,you

359
00:22:23,366 --> 00:22:28,227
know,do take good notes and
useful notes.Uh,I'm,I've,I never

360
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:30,416
learned that skill,you know,I
struggled with it in school and.

361
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:34,882
just didn't even try after school
But,uh,the times that I've taken

362
00:22:34,882 --> 00:22:37,132
notes,I'm like,man,this is
awesome.I should do this all the

363
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:38,662
time.And then I don't,

364
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:41,777
Rebecca: It Nice with the to-do
list.I have kinda that visual cue

365
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:44,896
of kind of where to start,where I
need to look and go.And I also

366
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:50,086
use org mode,um,with emax to kind
of keep another list of some

367
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:53,717
things like what progress I'm
making,where I'm at on it.Um,it

368
00:22:53,717 --> 00:22:57,852
gives you,you know,to do in
progress and review done.So I,I

369
00:22:57,852 --> 00:23:01,152
use that as well to accompany.
But yeah,even if I'm in a meeting

370
00:23:01,152 --> 00:23:03,281
with someone,I think one of my
first meetings with you,Dan,on

371
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:06,011
the work we did,I'm like,I'm a
note taker.If I'm looking down

372
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:09,761
doing this,I'm not ignoring you.
I'm just taking notes cuz I've,

373
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:12,491
you know,gotta have my pen and
paper nearby.I dunno if that

374
00:23:12,497 --> 00:23:14,922
comes with just,you know,keeping
laboratory notebooks all those

375
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:17,382
years.I mean,even my knitting and
crocheting,I've got a lab

376
00:23:17,761 --> 00:23:20,442
notebook,quote of the work I do
with it.So,

377
00:23:21,912 --> 00:23:22,771
Dan: That's awesome.

378
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:27,461
Bekah: I love that and I,I met,
um,with an owner of a company a

379
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:31,031
couple of years ago and I really
appreciated when he said to me,

380
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:34,811
if I'm looking down,it's because
I'm taking notes.Right.Because I

381
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:37,152
think sometimes that can be
off-putting and I appreciate

382
00:23:37,152 --> 00:23:40,332
that,that you mentioned that too.
Like if I'm not looking,and I try

383
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:46,602
and do that as well because I'm
a,a big note taker.I don't know

384
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:49,932
where I'm going with this train
of thought.other than,um,

385
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:53,951
notetaking is one of those things
that we actually talk about a lot

386
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:56,862
at Virtual Coffee and getting
started in note taking and

387
00:23:57,071 --> 00:24:01,061
different tools for note taking.
And it can be a little bit over

388
00:24:01,061 --> 00:24:05,342
like.Sounds straightforward,
right?You take notes,but it's,

389
00:24:05,342 --> 00:24:09,122
it's not like it's complex for a
lot of people.And then the tools

390
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:13,082
over there,out,out there can be
really overwhelming.I find myself

391
00:24:13,082 --> 00:24:19,442
mostly,um,pen and paper,but I do
have,I use obsidian very lightly.

392
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:24,082
Just because I mostly use it for
markdown to be able to do that.

393
00:24:24,652 --> 00:24:28,372
Have you gone on like a
note-taking journey where you've

394
00:24:28,372 --> 00:24:31,432
tried some of these other tools?
I tried notion like a handful of

395
00:24:31,432 --> 00:24:33,922
times and every time I'm just
super overwhelmed.I can't handle

396
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:34,041
it.

397
00:24:34,912 --> 00:24:37,432
Rebecca: So I've,I've kept up
with org mode a little bit and

398
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:40,432
there's a lot org mode can do.
It's,it's definitely more of an,

399
00:24:40,432 --> 00:24:46,872
an EMAX based,um,Um,that one I
just kind of keep trying some

400
00:24:46,872 --> 00:24:50,442
general notes and also kind of a
backup in case,you know,

401
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:54,251
something happens to my,my spiral
notebook or I can't find the

402
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:57,852
information readily readily so I
have it electronically so I can

403
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:02,571
kind of grasp where I'm.Where I'm
at with it and find it.Um,I've

404
00:25:02,662 --> 00:25:06,172
worked with not a little bit,I
don't dislike it,but I didn't see

405
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:10,261
where it really,helped me
specifically.So I don't use it

406
00:25:10,261 --> 00:25:13,771
very often.Um,no,it's not a knock
on the,the tool,it's just

407
00:25:13,981 --> 00:25:17,402
something that's not really
working for me right now.Um,but

408
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:20,102
what helps me with taking notes
and sometimes I'll go back

409
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:24,481
sometimes,um,I don't know
necessarily need the detail,but

410
00:25:24,721 --> 00:25:30,112
it gives.um,if,when I need it,
space and time,cuz if I have

411
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:34,942
space and time,I can usually find
what I'm looking for.Um,I tell

412
00:25:34,942 --> 00:25:38,143
people one of my superpowers is
finding needles in haystacks,and

413
00:25:38,147 --> 00:25:41,021
that helps me too.That,
especially if you can gimme a,a

414
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:47,541
timeline on that.Um,also as well,
you know,just writing the notes

415
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:52,146
sometimes helps me.Better retain
the information,so it helps me

416
00:25:52,146 --> 00:25:58,491
slow down,absorb what I need to
absorb.Kind have that reference

417
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:02,872
as well.Um,and you kind of
circling back to ham radio,I

418
00:26:02,872 --> 00:26:05,811
actually might see song on my
Twitter.I have this clipboard

419
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:08,842
where I'm writing down my
contacts.I've had that clipboard

420
00:26:08,932 --> 00:26:12,622
since I was10years old.I got it
for my birthday and I have,it has

421
00:26:12,622 --> 00:26:17,001
seen,you know,QSOs for ham radio.
It's seen my weekly spelling

422
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:21,321
list.it's seen my PhD
dissertation notes.It's,it's seen

423
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:25,821
a lot,but,um,it's,you know,
something that,It's just nice to

424
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:29,211
write it down.And I've learned
when I'm taking quick notes,like

425
00:26:29,211 --> 00:26:33,442
with my radio contacts,I have to
get those logged in cause you

426
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:37,041
have to log them into their app
to,for it to count.I've gotta do

427
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:41,182
that pretty soon because you can
get a backlog or it's like,I

428
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:45,711
don't remember the details of
this particular q s,so I need to

429
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:50,872
just go log.Get it where it needs
to go.So I get the important

430
00:26:50,872 --> 00:26:53,392
details where they need to be.
Um,of course,you know,if I'm

431
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:56,842
writing fast,the longer time
goes,the less I'm able to read my

432
00:26:56,842 --> 00:27:01,971
own handwriting.I'm left-handed,
I got that straw going on Um,but

433
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:07,734
yeah,it's like,um,I am a
shameless note taker.and,um,just

434
00:27:07,884 --> 00:27:11,005
any,like we've talked,yeah.
Virtual Coffee.It's like,okay,I

435
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:15,234
just need some college rule
paper.I need a,an extra fine

436
00:27:16,255 --> 00:27:20,424
point on it because being a
lefty,you get all this ink down

437
00:27:20,424 --> 00:27:24,894
your hand,it makes such a mess.
Um,when I would ta in,in grad

438
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,414
school when I was on the
whiteboard,even whiteboard,

439
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:31,345
present day,I'm always checking
myself to make I don't have all

440
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:34,045
the residue on my hand.But,eh,
lefty problem.So,

441
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:37,329
Bekah: always wanted to be
left-handed.There's a fun fact

442
00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:37,779
about me,

443
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,109
Rebecca: Blessing and a curse

444
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,319
Dan: What?Yeah,I mean,you could
train yourself to be left-handed.

445
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:49,750
Bekah: Well,I tried to for a
while when I was a kid.Um,just

446
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,430
dunno that I have that kind of
time

447
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:54,039
Dan: Yeah.Yeah.of a,

448
00:27:54,615 --> 00:27:57,045
Bekah: I feel like it's kind of
cheating.Like,oh,I'm not really

449
00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:00,375
left-handed.I just forced myself
to be able to be,

450
00:28:00,974 --> 00:28:04,424
Dan: yeah,I think,I mean,
honestly,being,being ambidextrous

451
00:28:04,424 --> 00:28:07,904
would be the,the coolest.I think
that'd be,that'd be really cool

452
00:28:07,904 --> 00:28:11,315
to be able to,you know,do
everything equally with both

453
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:11,555
hands.

454
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:15,795
Rebecca: Fun fact actually
left-handed people have a greater

455
00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:17,535
tendency to be ambidextrous,

456
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,980
Bekah: Oh,interesting.

457
00:28:19,694 --> 00:28:22,545
Dan: Is that a social thing or is
that like a,

458
00:28:23,115 --> 00:28:25,305
Rebecca: Well,in,in a
right-handed world,it's like we

459
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:29,609
have to adapt.So I learned to
play guitar.Um,back in college

460
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,970
and,you know,I was brought up to
the teacher,I'm like,I'm

461
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,880
left-handed.Do I need a
left-handed guitar?And he's,and

462
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,420
he presented that,you know,
lefties can be more ambidextrous.

463
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,279
And they're like,you know,that
makes sense.He's like,you know,

464
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,490
you try to learn right-handed
because you're really gonna cut

465
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:48,319
yourself off if you,you know,
have to be.If you have to guitar

466
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:52,069
left-handed,but guitar left-hand,
what controls the neck?So it

467
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:54,049
actually worked out for me.I
don't play a lot.I haven't

468
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:56,839
played,I can't remember the last
time I played.But,um,you know,

469
00:28:56,845 --> 00:28:59,990
taking kind of that iteration,I
was able to do that right-handed.

470
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,029
I sometimes have to cut
right-handed cuz the scissors

471
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:05,720
don't like me.But that's,once I
get of scissors,it works like

472
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,289
they're mine,

473
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,220
Dan: Yeah.Yeah,that,uh,the
scissors was a big,so my,my,uh,

474
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,869
younger son is left-handed,and
that was like,and none of,none of

475
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:19,170
my family is,you know,like,uh,
and the scissors,the fact that

476
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,329
right-handed scissor,there's
actually right-handed and

477
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:23,309
left-handed scissors,and they're,
they're,they're built

478
00:29:23,315 --> 00:29:26,160
differently.Like,that was a mind
blowing thing.I,I had no idea,no

479
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,799
idea about that.Like,I,I thought
it was just like,oh,the shape of

480
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,349
the holes,you know,the shape
that,you know,it's just like a

481
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:34,170
comfort thing.It was actually
like the way that the cutting

482
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:39,450
edges are.Is opposite on
left-handed scissors.Uh,and,and

483
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,819
it's something about the way
that,you know,cuz the way you

484
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:44,849
hold it,your,your thumb is
moving.The scissors,you know,so

485
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:48,150
that blade is the one that's
moving.And so when you do it the

486
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,759
opposite side,it doesn't cut that
well if you have right-handed

487
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:54,000
scissors and you're using your
left hand.And I had like,I had no

488
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,789
idea about that.is like a mind
blowing thing,so,

489
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,950
Rebecca: little scissors in
school,those little,little basic

490
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:04,250
safety scissors,those are a
nightmare lefthanded

491
00:30:04,454 --> 00:30:07,394
Dan: Oh,I mean,that's why we
Yeah,that,well,that's exactly why

492
00:30:07,394 --> 00:30:09,644
we did that cuz we have those,
those safety scissors and so we,

493
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:13,095
you can buy left-handed safety
scissors and they you know,you

494
00:30:13,095 --> 00:30:15,825
know what I mean?And so we,we did
that and it,like,it made a

495
00:30:15,825 --> 00:30:19,634
difference.But I had,I had no
idea.Yeah.Uh,learn,learn new

496
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:23,759
things.uh,I feel like Sam said,
so he's four and he gets confused

497
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,700
sometimes cuz his,you know,
Bennett's right-handed his,his

498
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,710
older brother that he,you know,
falls around and does all this

499
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,819
stuff.And so he's goes back and
forth.His,his mind is

500
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:35,640
left-handed,you know what I mean?
But he's like,he just gets all

501
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,009
mixed up.I'm like,why,why you
using your right hand?I'm like,

502
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:40,680
you can do whatever you know,but
like,I think it might be easier

503
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:46,170
for you if you,he's like,oh yeah,
I forgot.So I dunno.

504
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:49,394
Rebecca: it's always to remind
myself like,am I left-handed when

505
00:30:49,394 --> 00:30:51,825
I do this from I right-handed
when I do cuz I played,when I

506
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:55,934
played softball many years ago,I
played right-handed because I

507
00:30:55,934 --> 00:31:00,029
was.I could throw with,I throw
better with my left and I'd throw

508
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,660
left dominantly to this day,but I
couldn't catch,cause you have to,

509
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:07,589
your gloves on your right hand
playing softball.And I couldn't

510
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:10,740
catch as well with my right hand.
So I had to switch that up

511
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,960
because it's like,more efficient
if I can catch left-handed and,

512
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,279
you know,get by with my,you know,
right-handed arm So,yeah,it's,

513
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:26,160
it's definitely.you go through
life figuring it out.and in any

514
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:32,640
leftal can empathize with,um,
backing out of a parking space

515
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,410
the wrong way.And there get the
wrong end of the door.Like,you

516
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:40,170
know,with the bar you push on the
wrong side.

517
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:42,974
Bekah: I do that all the time.
I'm not sure what's wrong with

518
00:31:42,974 --> 00:31:49,996
me.That's my brain still wanting
to be left-handed.Yeah,it's

519
00:31:49,996 --> 00:31:52,455
interesting.I was talking to
somebody recently about this.It

520
00:31:52,455 --> 00:31:56,476
might have been James Quick,and I
wonder like there are some people

521
00:31:56,476 --> 00:32:01,576
that they will,right.Left-handed
or Right,right-handed.But they'll

522
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,776
do things like play golf or play
sports left-handed.And so then I,

523
00:32:05,776 --> 00:32:10,772
I wonder like how do you,like
what makes you right-handed or

524
00:32:10,772 --> 00:32:15,512
left-handed?Is it just.The hand
that you write with,and that's

525
00:32:15,512 --> 00:32:19,143
what you choose because if you
use your left hand dominantly in

526
00:32:19,202 --> 00:32:24,423
other things,then what?Are you
just ambidextrous?Is that what

527
00:32:24,428 --> 00:32:26,222
you say?I don't know.

528
00:32:26,432 --> 00:32:31,728
Rebecca: so for me,um,I would
tell people I.Pretty decently

529
00:32:31,728 --> 00:32:34,968
lefthanded cuz some people are,
are a little more dominant on the

530
00:32:35,147 --> 00:32:38,928
lefthand than others.So,um,I have
a cousin who's left-handed,you

531
00:32:38,928 --> 00:32:42,137
know,she played basketball
right-handed.I played basketball

532
00:32:42,137 --> 00:32:45,708
left cuz I was much better
left-handed than right,although

533
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:48,438
you had to,you know,if you're a
short five,three person like

534
00:32:48,442 --> 00:32:51,258
myself playing,you gotta play
point guard,handle the ball.But I

535
00:32:51,258 --> 00:32:56,222
was more dominant on the left
hand side.Softball again,I was

536
00:32:56,222 --> 00:33:01,083
just able to be more functional,
playing right-handed so I could,

537
00:33:01,262 --> 00:33:05,252
you know,throw in catch whereas,
you know,having to catch with my

538
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:08,012
right hand,it would,it'd been
more of a learning curve at the

539
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:08,462
time.

540
00:33:08,837 --> 00:33:10,938
Dan: yeah.So you could teach
yourself to do anything with

541
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:15,077
either hand if both hands work
the same,but left-handed isness

542
00:33:15,107 --> 00:33:17,748
or right-handed whatever.It's,
it's genetic.Like it is a genetic

543
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:21,857
thing,but,um,there's like a lot
of social,you know,things like,

544
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:26,147
uh,There was,you know,there,
there used to be like

545
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:29,057
superstitions about left-handed
people,right?And so that got like

546
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:33,377
corrected.And,and so the writing
is like,probably they just were

547
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:37,067
taught,either taught to write
right-handed before anybody

548
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:39,137
realized that they're
left-handed,or,you know,cuz it's

549
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:41,958
kind of hard when you have like
little kids,it's like they're

550
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:44,028
really paying attention to what
I,what they're doing or whatever.

551
00:33:44,028 --> 00:33:47,268
And so if they start writing and,
and you say,use your right hand,

552
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:49,488
use your right hand,you know,uh,
before you realize that they're

553
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:53,133
left-handed.That's probably how
that happens.You're making a lot

554
00:33:53,137 --> 00:33:53,732
of faces,

555
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:57,288
Bekah: I am,I'm going down a
rabbit hole of like,what makes

556
00:33:57,347 --> 00:34:00,887
some,like what happens in your
brain if you're left-handed.And

557
00:34:00,887 --> 00:34:04,097
it,I mean,it's wild.Let's see.
Um,

558
00:34:04,248 --> 00:34:05,208
Rebecca: We're in our right mind.

559
00:34:05,988 --> 00:34:10,967
Bekah: handedness is associated
with functional lateralization of

560
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:14,568
cerebral dominant.I,I just have

561
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,802
Dan: totally.I mean,I was gonna
say that I

562
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:23,418
Bekah: less lateralized brains.
What?This is really,I don't know.

563
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:29,807
I never really thought of the
neur of left-handedness until

564
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:34,367
right now,and now this is gonna
be something I'm stuck on.Wow.

565
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:37,788
There's studies that are done on
identical twins with different

566
00:34:37,788 --> 00:34:38,148
handed.

567
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:41,568
Rebecca: Yes,that is actually,I
had,um,identical twin friends in

568
00:34:41,568 --> 00:34:45,347
high school.Um,they're,a lot of
times they're mirror images of

569
00:34:45,347 --> 00:34:46,498
each other,so they're

570
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:47,077
Bekah: Whoa,

571
00:34:47,117 --> 00:34:47,728
Dan: Mm-hmm.

572
00:34:47,898 --> 00:34:51,047
Rebecca: images.One's usually
right-handed,one's usually

573
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,478
left-handed or maybe a little
more of the ambidextrous side,

574
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,927
but that's actually very common
with identical twins,at where

575
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:58,398
one's where handed ones left.

576
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:01,382
Dan: Yeah,I have good friends
that are in the same,the same

577
00:35:01,382 --> 00:35:03,693
situation I had,I had forgotten
about that till just now.But

578
00:35:03,693 --> 00:35:08,913
yeah,it's,uh,that honestly has
frus frustrating.You have,you,

579
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:13,893
you as a,as a parent,you have
then you have to buy different

580
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:19,833
sets of everything,all at once.
um,different baseball

581
00:35:20,177 --> 00:35:24,108
Bekah: uh,I'm gonna provide some
links in the show notes for

582
00:35:24,112 --> 00:35:27,898
anybody else who is in the brains
of left-handers.

583
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:33,344
Dan: this is,yeah,this was an
interesting,we,we always have

584
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:35,923
these strange offshoots in the,
in

585
00:35:36,148 --> 00:35:39,389
Rebecca: All about like the ink
mess on my hand,It's just

586
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:42,688
something that I've always been
cognizant of because makes such a

587
00:35:43,168 --> 00:35:49,648
mess.And we talked about note
taking,believer in note taking.

588
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:51,358
This is how I do it.

589
00:35:52,798 --> 00:35:55,619
Bekah: I love it though.I mean,
like,this is,uh,a lot of the

590
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:59,728
discussion about like who people
are,right?And I don't know,I

591
00:35:59,728 --> 00:36:03,028
don't have these conversations
all the time.I've never had this

592
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:05,909
conversation about
left-handedness.So it's like fun

593
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:09,599
to kind of think about like,
okay,who,who are the people who

594
00:36:09,628 --> 00:36:14,353
are in tech?And like,this is,
Maybe more fun than talking,more

595
00:36:14,353 --> 00:36:19,844
fun for me than,than comparing
technologies.Um,I wanna circle

596
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,813
back just for a second,uh,
because you have a PhD

597
00:36:23,623 --> 00:36:23,983
Rebecca: I do,

598
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:28,813
Bekah: we,we didn't really talk
about that that much.So your PhD

599
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:30,134
is in chemistry,right?

600
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:35,143
Rebecca: yes.I'm specifically
organic chemistry.Um,I went,went

601
00:36:35,143 --> 00:36:38,923
down the chemistry path.Um,in
college,I was a biology major.At

602
00:36:38,923 --> 00:36:43,153
first I changed my major to
chemistry.And um,when people ask,

603
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,103
it's like,okay,why are you a
chemistry major?Why did you

604
00:36:45,143 --> 00:36:50,128
change?I took organic chemistry
and I accidentally liked it,So,

605
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:53,188
you know,you get these horror
stories about organic chemistry

606
00:36:53,188 --> 00:36:57,809
is so hard.It's soul sucking,
it's torture.And you know,I

607
00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:01,199
really started enjoying it in
spite of,um,kind of a funny story

608
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:06,014
about,um,a lab writeup I did many
years ago.Um,I remember going to

609
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:08,443
office hours and getting
frustrated and I finally got the

610
00:37:08,443 --> 00:37:11,293
answer.And then I remember
telling my then,professor,I'm

611
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:18,014
never gonna work in a lab.famous
last words,Cause I,um,spent,

612
00:37:18,344 --> 00:37:22,724
spent years in research in labs
and funny enough that professor

613
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:27,134
was actually my contact on my
first academic research job.So

614
00:37:27,134 --> 00:37:30,164
I'm sure he laughed a lot about
my then19year old self

615
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,474
proclaiming.That's never gonna
happen,will

616
00:37:34,938 --> 00:37:38,148
Bekah: That's funny.I,my freshman
year of college,I wanted to be a

617
00:37:38,148 --> 00:37:41,059
math major,and so I wanted to
take Calc two,but they didn't

618
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:44,449
offer it.Instead they offered an
English class,which I took,and

619
00:37:44,449 --> 00:37:47,719
then I ended up being an English
major and taught English for10

620
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:51,559
years after that.So it's funny,
like the way that things happen

621
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:53,898
that you don't expect.Yeah.And
now I'm in tech,so

622
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:59,324
Rebecca: For sure and um,even
when I was a lab tech,when I was

623
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:02,909
applying to graduate schools,
cuz.You can learn a lot as a lab

624
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:08,009
tech,but you also hit glass
ceilings.So I wanted to do more

625
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:12,599
work where I could do independent
work,I could own my own projects,

626
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:17,759
um,you know,write papers,you
know,a lot,have a lot more,um,

627
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:22,708
options than you could as a lab
tech.And so in spite of getting

628
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:25,918
into the life sciences program at
the medical college,I was doing

629
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:29,623
research on,I'm like,you.Organic
Chemistry was where it was at for

630
00:38:29,623 --> 00:38:33,704
me.I need to go down that path.
So I went to Georgia Tech and my

631
00:38:33,704 --> 00:38:39,903
first half of my PhD was building
catalysts to purify compounds

632
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:42,313
that could be active
pharmaceutical ingredients,

633
00:38:42,344 --> 00:38:47,893
another type of a P I And then I
did my second half of my PhD in

634
00:38:47,983 --> 00:38:51,164
total synthesis where the
compounds I was targeting had

635
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:55,333
activity against.So there was
really some neat research there.

636
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,784
And then once I finished at
Georgia Tech,I went to UT

637
00:38:58,784 --> 00:39:02,744
Knoxville,university of
Tennessee,where I was able to,in

638
00:39:02,744 --> 00:39:06,884
my postdocs,take my organic
synthesis skillset,build catalyst

639
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:10,514
to convert lignan into valuable
fuels and chemicals,where that

640
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,963
was the end goal with the
catalyst,um,get these valuable

641
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:18,284
fuels and chemicals to have an
alternative for,um,non-renewable

642
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:21,853
resources.You know,should they
become de.So that's,you know,

643
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:26,414
some of the work where work with
my,you know,PhD research as well

644
00:39:26,414 --> 00:39:27,253
as my postdoc.

645
00:39:29,009 --> 00:39:33,208
Bekah: That's fascinating.And so
you spent a lot of time,it sounds

646
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:37,228
like,doing all of this stuff and
definitely a lot of schooling,

647
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:42,298
and that's a huge investment.And
then you decided to move into

648
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:45,239
tech.Was there any part of you
when you were making that

649
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:51,373
decision that.Like sad leaving
that behind or you know,I can't

650
00:39:51,373 --> 00:39:56,083
imagine it.It was an easy
decision to move over,but maybe

651
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,673
that's a part of the story we
don't know yet.

652
00:39:59,153 --> 00:40:01,583
Rebecca: Well,some of it too,you
know,it was,you know,we were in

653
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:06,023
the height of the pandemic and
you know,even though at my time

654
00:40:06,023 --> 00:40:08,903
my work was on site,cuz in
chemistry you can't really you

655
00:40:08,903 --> 00:40:12,384
know,unless you're safely set up
to have the fume hood and do this

656
00:40:12,384 --> 00:40:17,063
stuff at home,you don't do that
stuff at home.And I was at the

657
00:40:17,063 --> 00:40:21,313
point of like,okay,well.how,what
is normal gonna look like when

658
00:40:21,313 --> 00:40:24,853
the world opens up again?And I
wanted to have those options of,

659
00:40:25,273 --> 00:40:30,494
of being able to use that same
problem solving skillset to be

660
00:40:30,498 --> 00:40:36,704
able to do a role where I could
do anywhere.Um,so some of it was

661
00:40:36,704 --> 00:40:40,213
the sign of the times.It was a
lot of it.And again,you know,

662
00:40:40,213 --> 00:40:43,483
having that flexibility of,you
know,doing your work from

663
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:47,324
anywhere,you know,it provided you
do it well,you know,that time you

664
00:40:47,324 --> 00:40:49,693
don't commute could be time,you
know,you find a mountain bike

665
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:52,813
trail and you know,you get a ride
in.Cuz those things were

666
00:40:52,813 --> 00:40:57,824
important too.So,um,I do,you
know,look back and can be,you

667
00:40:57,824 --> 00:41:00,193
know,proud of the work I've done,
the contributions I've made to

668
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:05,608
the field.Um,but you know,I've
had a good time in tech,a great

669
00:41:05,608 --> 00:41:08,608
time,you know,troubleshooting.
Like I'll go through,you know,

670
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:13,289
some of my apps and you know,you
know,kinda take the same approach

671
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:16,469
as I I did in science.It's like,
okay,I gotta troubleshoot.I gotta

672
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:20,489
take one variable at a time.Um,
in tech,of course,you know,I'll

673
00:41:20,518 --> 00:41:25,259
play user on my UI and going back
to taking notes,it's like,okay,

674
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:29,699
I'm gonna.Do,uh,engagement in
action,I'm gonna write down what

675
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:33,719
happens and then have that record
of,you know,where maybe something

676
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:38,068
went south and it's like,okay,
I'm gonna target this here,start

677
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:40,978
here.Cause I know this isn't
doing what I want it to do.And

678
00:41:40,978 --> 00:41:45,869
then,you know,push it forward.
And,um,yeah,it's,it's not,you

679
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:51,329
know,being in,in a lab.you know,
being able to troubleshoot still

680
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:55,829
and be able to do it on that
rapid time scale,um,is something

681
00:41:55,829 --> 00:42:00,599
that I really enjoy and I'm glad
I,you know,took that step.You

682
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:04,318
know,and it is a risk in a way
cuz it is different than,you

683
00:42:04,324 --> 00:42:07,289
know,setting up your experiments,
but you know,to be able to still

684
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:10,469
troubleshoot and solve problems
and,you know,still even

685
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:16,063
collaborate.So it is like,you
know,in research.you know,with

686
00:42:16,063 --> 00:42:19,063
collaborations,you know,plant
scientists for example,instead of

687
00:42:19,063 --> 00:42:22,693
me learning how to be a plant
scientist,I go talk to a plant

688
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:25,483
scientist.We talk about some
problems that we may need to

689
00:42:25,483 --> 00:42:28,514
solve for the project and they
can,they've got the

690
00:42:28,543 --> 00:42:31,873
infrastructure to set up those
experiments.Whereas I would have

691
00:42:32,264 --> 00:42:37,094
a lab accessible where we had,
you know,stuff setting up to do

692
00:42:37,094 --> 00:42:41,204
synthetic organic chemistry.It's
less time for me to set up what I

693
00:42:41,204 --> 00:42:43,844
need to set up.I have the
know-how and the AC and the

694
00:42:43,844 --> 00:42:49,304
instruments and.Um,other setup to
get those things done.And even in

695
00:42:50,253 --> 00:42:53,653
software and Virtual Coffee,even
specifically,I have an idea of

696
00:42:53,653 --> 00:42:58,063
like,okay,I don't do ruby gun
rails.I know Meg does.I know

697
00:42:58,063 --> 00:43:01,543
people who do view type script.
Dan being one of those people,

698
00:43:01,543 --> 00:43:06,193
you know,content creation,Bekah,
you.You do this every day,um,you

699
00:43:06,193 --> 00:43:09,134
know,you,you know who you can
reach out to that can give you

700
00:43:09,134 --> 00:43:13,844
insight on things that you need
to know,but you don't need to

701
00:43:13,844 --> 00:43:18,494
spend day-to-day doing.So still,
I'm still getting all those

702
00:43:18,498 --> 00:43:20,969
goodies that I got,you know,
working in a research lab.

703
00:43:21,878 --> 00:43:25,088
Bekah: I think that's such a
great mindset,and I think there

704
00:43:25,088 --> 00:43:27,458
are a lot of people out there
that think that you have to do it

705
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:31,208
all and you definitely don't.
It's,it's knowing who you can

706
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:34,539
talk to about doing those things
and utilizing them when you need

707
00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:38,648
to.That really makes you strong
at what you do.That's,that's

708
00:43:38,648 --> 00:43:38,918
really.

709
00:43:40,693 --> 00:43:43,873
Dan: Yeah,especially as,excuse
me,especially as an independent,

710
00:43:43,934 --> 00:43:47,864
um,developer,you know,it is such
a strong and important skill to

711
00:43:47,864 --> 00:43:51,434
have in your clients,so I think
we would appreciate it too.You

712
00:43:51,623 --> 00:43:55,213
know,not have.Like the exact same
thing,right?Like,oh no,like I

713
00:43:55,213 --> 00:43:59,143
have to do this thing that I know
nothing about.Do I want the,do I

714
00:43:59,143 --> 00:44:02,083
want the client to pay me for
like two weeks to learn a new

715
00:44:02,088 --> 00:44:06,014
thing?Or,you know,an hour of
somebody else's time that already

716
00:44:06,014 --> 00:44:08,744
knows it,right?The same,same
thing.It's,it's,it's so cool.

717
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:13,344
Bekah: So I,I do have just two
more questions for you.And the

718
00:44:13,344 --> 00:44:17,333
first one is you.Got this really
great journey that you've gone

719
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:21,293
on.Uh,you've learned all of these
things.What is one word to

720
00:44:21,724 --> 00:44:23,003
describe your career journey?

721
00:44:24,143 --> 00:44:28,483
Rebecca: I'd say dynamic,um,
hands down.Um,it constantly

722
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:32,768
changed whether I was seeking
those changes or they.you know,

723
00:44:32,768 --> 00:44:35,798
presented themselves in this.
Like I was keeping an open mind,

724
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:40,208
like,okay,this is the better fit
for me right now and um,I'll use

725
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:43,719
it again.You know,I accidentally
liked organic chemistry.I went

726
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:47,889
down that path in science,and
then when I switched over to

727
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:51,668
tech,I thought the data science
was gonna be my jam.And,you know,

728
00:44:51,998 --> 00:44:54,668
I don't close the doors on
anything.But,you know,having that

729
00:44:54,878 --> 00:44:59,889
skillset in science to be able to
visually,you know,tell stories

730
00:44:59,893 --> 00:45:03,938
with data,you know,I'm like,
that's,that's me.That's,that's

731
00:45:03,938 --> 00:45:07,539
written about me.But you know,I
ended up getting really

732
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:09,938
acquainted with the front end
and,you know,being a visual

733
00:45:09,938 --> 00:45:13,358
learner,that actually looking
back makes a lot of sense.And

734
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:17,349
I've been.You know,more front
end,heavy,more react heavy that

735
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:19,748
way.And then I've also learned a
little bit more on the back end,

736
00:45:19,809 --> 00:45:24,909
um,circling back after a little
bit from the initial Python and R

737
00:45:24,914 --> 00:45:28,329
with data science.So yeah,it's,
um,I'd say dynamic.It's

738
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:31,509
constantly changing.It's gonna
change from this point forward.

739
00:45:31,514 --> 00:45:37,179
And keeping an open mind has
always,you know,been beneficial

740
00:45:37,179 --> 00:45:40,418
cuz you just never know what you
might be a good fit for to given

741
00:45:40,418 --> 00:45:40,978
time and.

742
00:45:42,094 --> 00:45:44,103
Bekah: that's exactly what I was
gonna say.What is strength that

743
00:45:44,103 --> 00:45:47,313
you have in that openness to
consider other things that might

744
00:45:47,313 --> 00:45:50,389
not seem like the natural path,
cuz that can be really hard to

745
00:45:50,389 --> 00:45:56,793
do.And my last question for you
is,what is one word that

746
00:45:56,793 --> 00:45:57,873
describes you?

747
00:45:59,228 --> 00:46:04,239
Rebecca: I'm gonna go with the
word consistent.So,um,I would say

748
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:06,398
I am a,what you see is what you
get kind of person

749
00:46:06,398 --> 00:46:10,478
personality-wise.I would've told
you that years ago.And,you know,

750
00:46:10,478 --> 00:46:13,449
in spite of,you know,the learning
experiences,the things you know,

751
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:17,248
That we grow from.I would say
that the Rebecca you're talking

752
00:46:17,248 --> 00:46:19,949
to now was the same Rebecca you
would've met in high school,more

753
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:25,463
or less.And then as far as
staying consistent on,you know,

754
00:46:25,463 --> 00:46:29,483
goals or projects that matter to
me from anywhere of,you know,

755
00:46:29,893 --> 00:46:33,353
videotaping myself for three
months,doing cheers and jumps and

756
00:46:33,594 --> 00:46:38,034
handsprings so I could finally
make my squad success,I did,I did

757
00:46:38,034 --> 00:46:42,503
that three months straight to,
um,you know,see myself to train

758
00:46:42,503 --> 00:46:46,954
and see what I needed to do,um,
to,you know,present day.Been

759
00:46:46,954 --> 00:46:50,134
consistently working on coding
and you know,even though you may

760
00:46:50,134 --> 00:46:53,344
not see this big significant
change in a day,

761
00:46:54,099 --> 00:46:54,518
Bekah: Hmm.

762
00:46:56,434 --> 00:47:01,293
Rebecca: consistent has
consistently served me well.So,

763
00:47:01,384 --> 00:47:06,054
um,I definitely say I'm,I'm
consistent.If I can keep,you

764
00:47:06,054 --> 00:47:09,923
know,keep at something,sometimes
it happens,you know,rapidly.

765
00:47:09,923 --> 00:47:12,804
Sometimes you wish it would
happen faster,but that

766
00:47:12,804 --> 00:47:16,014
consistency has always been
something that,that,again has

767
00:47:16,014 --> 00:47:16,733
served me well.

768
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:20,438
Bekah: This is great.Well,thank
you so much for being here with

769

us today and talking through all
of this,your interesting journey

770
00:47:24,548 --> 00:47:27,699
and giving us,I think,a lot of
insight into what you're doing.

771
00:47:27,704 --> 00:47:30,789
And your approach to me is
something that I'm gonna go back

772
00:47:30,818 --> 00:47:34,208
and reflect on because I think
that there are so many strengths

773
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:38,438
that you have there and ways that
I would like to grow in my own

774
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,148
journey.So I really appreciate
you.
