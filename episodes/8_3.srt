00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:10,044
Bekah: Hello and welcome to
season eight,episode three of the

2
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:15,028
Virtual Coffee Podcast.I'm Bekah,
and this is a podcast that

3
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:18,809
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community.Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:22,829
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:25,949
journey,and they're here on this
podcast sharing their stories and

6
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,998
what they've learned here with me
today is my co-host Dan.

7
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:34,066
Dan: What up Bek?Uh,hey,how's it
going?

8
00:00:35,176 --> 00:00:36,786
Bekah: It's going well.How's it
going with you?

9
00:00:37,216 --> 00:00:42,975
Dan: It is going fantastic.Kali f
fantastically.It's going well.

10
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:47,176
Well,I feel like going fantastic
is not good,you know,proper

11
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:50,536
grammar,right?Because.It's
fantastic as an adjective and not

12
00:00:50,536 --> 00:00:55,006
an adverb.And so,yeah,but
fantastically is a weird sounding

13
00:00:55,006 --> 00:01:02,340
word,so.Anyway,I'm fantastic.Um,
anyway,today's episode features

14
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:08,250
Carmen Kolohe and she is a DevOps
engineer.And,um,we had a really

15
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,849
great time,uh,talking with,with
Carmen.Uh,she had a lot of.Great

16
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:15,150
things to share about her
process,like how she got into

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,659
tech and how she got into DevOps
in particular.And I thought she

18
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,390
had a really unique perspective
on,on making connections and,uh,

19
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,980
you know,involving your community
and your network and furthering

20
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:32,489
your career goals and furthering
your developer journey.And I

21
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:34,540
dunno,it was,it was cool.It was,
it was a good conversation.

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,950
Bekah: Yeah,I appreciated that
she talked about being an

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,620
introvert,and I think she's
mentioned that she might be shy

24
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,670
too.And so it was a good example
of what happens when you take

25
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,909
yourself out of your comfort zone
a little bit and how,uh,

26
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,909
impactful that can be on the rest
of your career.I.

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,810
Dan: Totally.And not,not just
taking yourself out of your

28
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,534
comfort zone,but ways to do that.
Um.But feel more comfortable

29
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:03,254
doing it,which is sort of,I don't
know,uh,a weird thing to say

30
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:05,625
about going out of your comfort
zone,you know,but,uh,ways,ways to

31
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,895
make your,maybe it's just ways to
expand your comfort zone.I don't,

32
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:13,425
I don't know.Um,but either way,
uh,we'll let Carmen do the

33
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:17,594
talking for,for us,uh,cuz she did
a good job explaining it and I am

34
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:19,245
not doing a good job explaining
it.

35
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,669
Bekah: No,it was really great to
learn from her in this episode

36
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:27,360
and learn a little bit more about
what DevOps is and to,I think,

37
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:30,870
inspire some people who are in
the middle of their career

38
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,001
journey.we start every episode of
the podcast,like we start every

39
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:37,491
Virtual Coffee.We introduce
ourselves with our name,where

40
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:41,931
we're from,what we do,and a
random check-in question.We hope

41
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:53,913
you enjoy this episode.Today's
random check-in question is if

42
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:57,663
you could have a superpower that
only worked while you were

43
00:02:57,663 --> 00:03:05,117
sleeping,what would it be?My name
is Bekah.I am the developer

44
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:10,646
experience lead at Open Sauced
from a small town in Ohio.And I

45
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:15,236
think like the superpower.Okay,
so there's two options here.Like

46
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:19,887
the ability to like really engage
with your dreams and remember

47
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:22,616
them,like those become actual
worlds.That would be pretty cool.

48
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:29,651
Um,or having my whole house
cleaned while I'm asleep.So that

49
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:33,912
one's not as cool,but definitely
practical and I would appreciate

50
00:03:33,912 --> 00:03:39,491
that.So I think,I think I'm gonna
have to go with my house being

51
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:41,532
cleaned when I woke up.

52
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:45,651
Dan: Uh,all right.That's fair.
You know,that makes me weird.

53
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:50,097
Like,do you remember,um,What is
that King Arthur Disney movie

54
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:54,116
called,uh,the Sword and the
Stone?Um,you know,where the,like

55
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:57,206
the wizard,the Merlin starts
doing the like,you know,but they

56
00:03:57,206 --> 00:03:59,516
get out of control after if he
doesn't pay attention to him.

57
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:01,856
That,that like worries me,you
know?You know,like,like when a

58
00:04:01,861 --> 00:04:05,606
Roomba,I don't know,gets,gets
into trouble,right?So

59
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,872
Bekah: that in King Arthur?Is
that in Fantasia

60
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,276
Dan: No,no,no.It was,well,maybe
both actually.I'm not sure.I

61
00:04:11,276 --> 00:04:14,067
haven't,I watched Sword Stone a
lot more than I watched Fantasia,

62
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:17,531
so.I'm not gonna say it's not
advantageous,but I'm thinking

63
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,641
specifically of sword and stone.
But anyway,the like non-conscious

64
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:23,982
control over something that is
like cleaning things,you know,

65
00:04:24,312 --> 00:04:26,862
like could be,it could be
problematic,but in general that

66
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,182
does sound nice.Um,

67
00:04:28,197 --> 00:04:30,387
Bekah: my house is pretty messy,
so I don't think it would get

68
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:31,226
that worse.

69
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:38,007
Dan: Right.Uh,okay.I'm Dan.I do
development.I live in Ohio and in

70
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:42,896
Cleveland,I suppose.And,um,not,I
suppose that's where I live and,

71
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:48,757
uh,what I do development,I,I
think,um,I think I'm gonna go

72
00:04:48,757 --> 00:04:52,357
with like Wolverine level,you
know,regeneration,healing,you

73
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:55,987
know,so you could go to sleep and
like anything that's like wrong

74
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:59,857
or broken,you know,gets fixed up
while you're sleeping.Um,that was

75
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:02,137
the first thing that popped in my
head.And,and I,I haven't thought

76
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:04,536
of anything better,so I'm gonna,
I'm gonna go with,yeah.

77
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,786
Regeneration,you know,healing.
Healing powers while you're

78
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:10,721
sleeping seems,seems nice.Maybe
it'd fix up some of my.Just

79
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:13,992
general aches and stuff too,you
know,I could pop out of bed in

80
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:17,502
the morning,uh,you know,I dunno.
Uh,so yeah,that's gonna be my

81
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:20,141
answer.And,um,here's our guest.
Carmen,go ahead.

82
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:26,461
Carmen: Hi.Hi friends.I'm Carmen,
I'm a DevOps engineer in

83
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:34,081
Portland,Oregon.And,uh,Bekah you
actually inspired me for,and it's

84
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:37,262
like,uh,have either of you
watched Rick and Morty?

85
00:05:38,726 --> 00:05:39,146
Dan: A little bit.

86
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:43,646
Carmen: Terry.Well,scary Terry is
like a reference to uh,Freddie

87
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:47,906
Krueger,but it's not like I'm
gonna like hurt people in dreams.

88
00:05:47,906 --> 00:05:52,586
I just wanna be in other people's
dreams,you know,and like travel

89
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,857
through dreams,I guess,and other
people's dreams type of thing.I

90
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:59,966
think that would be cool cuz my
sister and I both have very vivid

91
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:04,117
dreams.It'd be cool to actually
like be in her dream and make my

92
00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:08,346
own choices and not,she tells me
what I did in her dream,you know?

93
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:11,197
And then it's like,I'm sorry that
I did that,or,you know,I would've

94
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:12,726
done it differently probably.

95
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,947
Dan: Uh,yeah,that made me start
thinking about like,inception,

96
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:19,737
you know,or where they like
design,design the dreams and are,

97
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:23,817
act actively like,you know,
acting in them and stuff.Uh,

98
00:06:24,387 --> 00:06:28,406
some,you know,some scary
possibilities though if you're

99
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:31,797
able to go in anybody's dreams,
you know,uh,like Steeler Secrets

100
00:06:31,797 --> 00:06:35,187
or whatever,I suppose.I don't
know.Um,but I think that'd be

101
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,367
cool.Um,Yeah.Especially if you
could do it with a buddy,you

102
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:39,747
know,be like,Hey,let's meet up.

103
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:41,906
Bekah: Maybe they have to give
you a password,

104
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:42,656
Dan: Yeah.Oh,

105
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:47,007
Bekah: in the dream that allows
you to be in their dream.

106
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:48,262
Carmen: Uhhuh Uhhuh.

107
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:48,947
Dan: your handshake.

108
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,786
Carmen: Yeah.That's so

109
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:51,427
Dan: I love it.

110
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:55,586
Carmen: I,uh,I had a very vivid
room this morning and it was,I

111
00:06:55,586 --> 00:07:00,057
was taking a test and my phone
kept going off during the exam,

112
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:03,416
and I kept having to turn it off.
Come to find out I was actually

113
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:07,536
turning my alarm off on my phone
that was trying to wake me up,

114
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:13,797
and I turned off four of them.
Luckily,I set like10of them,so I

115
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:16,557
was like,what a,what?Dreams are
just crazy.Huh?

116
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:22,512
Dan: funny.Your subconscious is,
you know,just telling you you

117
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:23,562
need some more sleep,I guess.

118
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:26,786
Carmen: Oh,yeah,and,and that I
have an exam coming up.

119
00:07:27,221 --> 00:07:28,362
Dan: Right,right,right.

120
00:07:30,086 --> 00:07:32,906
Bekah: Well,Carmen,we're really
happy to have you here with us

121
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:37,617
today.Thanks for being here.And
we always like to get started

122
00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:42,447
with your journey into tech.So
how did you get from Pretech

123
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:44,036
Carmen to where you are now?

124
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:48,161
Carmen: Yeah,thanks for having
me.I've been listening to the

125
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:55,451
podcast for a bit now.Uh,so how
did I get to here?Um,well it all

126
00:07:55,451 --> 00:08:00,882
started in Poland.Um,I was born
in Poland and uh,I grew up in

127
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:04,182
Chicago and only,I don't have a
Polish accent,but I do have a

128
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:09,237
Chicago accent.When I say Chicago
Hot dog or Costco.Other than

129
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:15,956
that,you would've no idea where
I'm from.Uh,and yeah,I,uh,I

130
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:21,266
initially,uh,got my degree in
psychology.I've always wanted to

131
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:26,276
help people and,uh,you know,that
was my goal.Like for early on,

132
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:29,096
very early on that I was gonna
get my doctorate,I was gonna get

133
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:33,386
into psychology and,uh,yeah,that
I got my degree and I realized

134
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:39,542
that's not what I wanted to do.
So I decided to,um,you know,I,I

135
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:42,631
graduated,I was living in Hawaii
at the time,and,uh,then I

136
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:45,961
graduated,you know,lived my best
life in Hawaii and then decided

137
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:50,672
to travel through Europe for a
bit.And,uh,then when I got back

138
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:54,511
from Europe,um,I was just,uh,in
Colorado,just hanging out in

139
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:58,892
Colorado.And,uh,my friend,uh,my
childhood friend shows up and

140
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:03,751
she's like,let's learn html,c s s
and JavaScript,just randomly one

141
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,871
night.And I was like,sure,why
not?Like,what else are we gonna

142
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:13,241
do tonight?You know?And uh,it was
really cool.It was fun.Uh,And,

143
00:09:13,272 --> 00:09:18,282
uh,that's when,uh,I decided to,
uh,move to Seattle with,uh,a

144
00:09:18,282 --> 00:09:21,731
partner at the time and go to,I,
I researched this one bootcamp

145
00:09:21,912 --> 00:09:24,912
that I really wanted to do
because,uh,then I could do the

146
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:28,481
bootcamp and work part-time at a
restaurant or something and then,

147
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:34,841
you know,just not be,be able to
do both.Um,then2020happened.Uh,

148
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:38,476
That fun time and we were in
Seattle and that was like ground

149
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:44,476
zero,right?Uh,so everything shut
down.Um,and I was like,if there

150
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:49,076
was a sign from the universe that
I should just.Do nothing but

151
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:52,647
learn something new or do a
career change,it's now I have the

152
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:57,777
opportunity to do that.Uh,so,uh,
yeah,yeah,yeah.I,I,I got into the

153
00:09:57,777 --> 00:10:01,437
bootcamp that I wanted to,and it
was all remote.Um,they did a

154
00:10:01,437 --> 00:10:05,126
hybrid between Seattle,Portland,
and,uh,people that were outta

155
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:09,956
state too.And,um,it was hard.
They call it a bootcamp for a

156
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:16,052
reason.Like it's not a joke.It
was intense and uh,and you know,

157
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:18,721
you have everything on top of
that.You know,you have covid

158
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:23,011
happening.There was wildfires
going a around,so the air was

159
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:31,017
toxic with disease and smoke.Uh,
so it was a tough time.And,uh,

160
00:10:31,076 --> 00:10:34,976
you know,uh,towards the end of
it,I had no idea how people made

161
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:38,486
money.Just Cody,I'm like,you're
gonna pay me to code.Like,how

162
00:10:38,486 --> 00:10:44,067
does that work?And,uh,in this
last like hail Mary attempt to

163
00:10:44,072 --> 00:10:50,397
like,figure things out,I,um,I
sent an email to a really good

164
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:53,846
friend of mine now,but,so,so I
guess,let me back up.The,the

165
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:59,621
bootcamp they would do,uh,um,
Like lunch speakers during lunch,

166
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:05,142
and one of them,uh,was,uh,this
fine gentleman named Jonin,uh,

167
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:11,412
and,uh,in fact,you know,jonin.
Yeah.Uh,he,uh,he's a developer

168
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:17,287
relations,uh,person.Great human
being.Um,just.Great person.Uh,

169
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:21,517
and I,I sent him an email,you
know,it'd been like five months

170
00:11:21,517 --> 00:11:24,427
since he did the lunch and learn,
but I just,I sent him this novel

171
00:11:24,427 --> 00:11:27,726
of an email and I was like,my
life is a dumpster fire right

172
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:33,067
now.Uh,but it keeps me warm and
um,it gives me light,you know?

173
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:36,371
Cause I,I've made a bunch of
friends.You know,we were all

174
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:39,731
trauma bonded through our
bootcamp too,cuz we,all we had

175
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:43,601
was each other and we all had to
try and figure it out and get

176
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:48,761
jobs from this somehow.Uh,and
Jonah actually,he replied and he

177
00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:50,711
was like,these are really good
questions.Cause I asked a bunch

178
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:55,032
of questions like,how do I make
money?What is this?You know?And

179
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:58,751
he's,he,he responded.He's like,
these are great questions to,um,

180
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:01,692
that I feel a lot of other people
just starting out in tech would.

181
00:12:02,442 --> 00:12:06,822
Would want answers to.And uh,he
was like,would you be open to

182
00:12:06,822 --> 00:12:11,261
like,come on,uh,my Twitch stream
and ask them.And like then other

183
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:15,822
people can have these answers
available to them as well.And I

184
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:20,532
am introverted and very shy and I
was like,uh,can I bring my

185
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:26,591
friends with me?And I brought two
of my friends from the bootcamp

186
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:30,011
cuz I figured they also had
questions to ask.And you know,

187
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,081
it's always good when you're an
introvert and you have an

188
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:35,621
extrovert friend,cuz then it
takes the pressure off of you.

189
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:36,581
Uh,

190
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:37,417
Bekah: Yep.

191
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:43,101
Carmen: yeah.So,uh,then,uh,then
we,uh,did this stream.It turned

192
00:12:43,392 --> 00:12:47,861
into like a weekly thing,uh,all
of2020.Uh,it was really good cuz

193
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:52,121
um,we were all really isolated.
You know,you couldn't go outside.

194
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:57,251
Uh,And,uh,met a lot of people
through it.Like,uh,Nick that goes

195
00:12:57,251 --> 00:13:01,932
to Virtual Coffee.Um,it was just
a safe space,uh,you know,and that

196
00:13:01,937 --> 00:13:05,322
that's what Virtual Coffee is,
uh,as well.But we were more like

197
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:11,591
virtual happy hour cuz we would
have drinks.Um,uh,it was late,

198
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:15,971
late,it was at night.Uh,so,uh,
yeah,we would just,we would a,

199
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:21,397
take questions from either,um,
the chat or,uh,We had questions

200
00:13:21,397 --> 00:13:25,537
obviously,cause we were still in
bootcamp.Uh,and it turned into a

201
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:31,027
really wonderful thing that I,I,
I cherished a lot.Um,it was a

202
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:35,017
good time.And,uh,then,uh,yeah,so
the bootcamp,uh,the bootcamp

203
00:13:35,017 --> 00:13:38,856
happened and with this bootcamp
they offer an internship and I

204
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:45,067
got this internship.Uh,and my
task as an intern was to build a

205
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:51,402
full stack app.Uh,and I did.
Because,you know,a great poet

206
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:55,331
once said,you know,you only get
one shot,one opportunity to seize

207
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:59,081
everything you ever wanted.One
moment.Would you capture it or

208
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:02,621
let it slip?Right.And I did.Um,I

209
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:04,761
Dan: That's cha,that's chaser,
right?That's a,

210
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:07,572
Carmen: You know your poetry,
huh?

211
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:11,381
Dan: that's,I'm an English major.
You know,don't like to brag about

212
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:11,831
it too much.

213
00:14:13,932 --> 00:14:18,312
Carmen: Uh,but yeah,I,I saw the
opportunity and I built it and at

214
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:22,272
the end of my,uh,internship,I was
in one of their meetings where

215
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:26,366
they were going over their like
quarterly,uh,Goals.And in quarter

216
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:31,017
four,uh,they were looking to hire
a junior developer.And I was

217
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:35,397
like,Hey,let me help you meet
this goal sooner.Like thi right

218
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:38,846
now,like,how about you just hire
me and I'll maintain this app?

219
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:42,986
Cause we were about to deploy and
everything like that.And they,

220
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:47,667
they said yes.I'm like,you like
me,I like you.Like,not ruin a

221
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:53,427
good thing.And,uh,yeah.Uh,I got
hired as a junior developer

222
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:59,216
there,and it,it was,uh,for a
nonprofit.Uh,and,uh,it,it was,it

223
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:02,096
was really,really cool work cuz
the,the work I was doing was

224
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:05,726
helping people and uh,that,
that's when I knew like,this is

225
00:15:05,726 --> 00:15:09,397
how I could help people was like
in tech and especially in2022cuz

226
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:12,417
businesses were closing down.
Like people were trying to figure

227
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:15,657
out ways to get online to do
anything.I was like,this is how I

228
00:15:15,657 --> 00:15:22,407
directly can help people.And,uh,
the.The first job meant a lot to

229
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:26,667
me because it also goes like full
circle.Uh,the friend that,you

230
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:30,326
know,came over that one day and
was like,Hey,let's do this on a

231
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:35,277
Friday night.Uh,her life was
saved.Uh,so the nonprofit is for

232
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:41,427
organ and,uh,tissue,uh,donation
and,and transplantation,um,and

233
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:45,777
procurement.And that friend,her
life was saved by a liver

234
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:49,647
donation when she was a baby.And
so it just was like a full circle

235
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:53,576
moment.Like my first job was,you
know,doing something that,you

236
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:57,777
know,that got me to this point.
So it was really cool.Uh,and

237
00:15:57,777 --> 00:16:03,807
yeah.And then,uh,the DevOps
engineer decided to take,uh,um,

238
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:06,746
an opportunity elsewhere.So the
position was open.I was like,

239
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:11,547
Hey,I like you,you like me?Like,
how about I try,try the DevOps

240
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:14,787
position,you know,instead of
hiring someone else,like,well,

241
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:17,547
let's see if I could do it.And
they,you know,they believed in me

242
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:21,476
and,uh,I,I stepped up and,and
started doing DevOps for them.

243
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:26,927
And then,uh,and then,yeah,and
then I,uh,got another opportunity

244
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:32,307
offered,uh,where I could,um,grow
and work with people at a,you

245
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:39,206
know,a larger scale work with,
uh,um,Leadership,uh,and,uh,so,so

246
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:42,417
I left that place and,uh,I'm at
this place now as the DevOps

247
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:46,616
engineer and uh,it's really
great.It's really cool stuff.So

248
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:47,846
that,that's kind of,it's.

249
00:16:49,386 --> 00:16:53,287
Bekah: That's awesome.What an
incredible journey.Um,before we

250
00:16:53,292 --> 00:17:00,006
move on,for our listeners,can you
describe what a DevOps engineer

251
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:01,267
is and what they do?

252
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:10,632
Carmen: Me,uh,gosh,uh,DevOps
means everything and nothing,not

253
00:17:10,636 --> 00:17:14,892
nothing,but,uh,means something
different to everyone and every

254
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:18,951
company depending on what their
ne needs are.Uh,some people think

255
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:22,241
DevOps should only be there at
the very beginning or at the very

256
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:27,642
end,or,You know,but it's,uh,it's
a,it's a Jedi way.It's a,it's a,

257
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:31,632
it's a mindset,you know?Uh,
overall I think,uh,how I see

258
00:17:31,662 --> 00:17:35,771
DevOps is like,you see the whole
big picture and then can like

259
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:39,521
zoom into like one specific part,
whether it's development,whether

260
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:47,156
it's deployment,uh,you know,all
of it together.Um,so,uh,It kind

261
00:17:47,156 --> 00:17:50,606
of just,and it's,you know,those
famous words to it on every team.

262
00:17:50,606 --> 00:17:58,076
Someone always says,it depends.
It depends.So a DevOps engineer

263
00:17:58,082 --> 00:18:02,096
Yeah,they're,they're not,uh,you
know,I,I,I'm not just,uh,focused

264
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:05,817
on,you know,front end work,but I
can be,if you need me there,I can

265
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:09,326
be there and I can do it.Or if
it's backend work or if it's,um,

266
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:15,356
deploying or if it's networking,
you know?So,uh,yeah.But overall

267
00:18:15,356 --> 00:18:20,217
it's,it's a way of,of thinking of
things.Uh,yeah.

268
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:23,981
Bekah: And what kind of
interested you in moving in that

269
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:24,701
direction?

270
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:30,807
Carmen: Um,because I feel like I
was already doing it as a junior

271
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:34,527
developer because we were a small
team.It was just me and the

272
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:41,696
DevOps engineer and,uh,All I,all
that was missing was access to

273
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:49,317
Azure.Then I feel like I was,you
know,basically helping,you know,

274
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:54,086
do the work too.And yeah,it,it's
good.It's nice to see the overall

275
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:59,096
picture cuz then you can.Code
more mindfully if it's,you know,

276
00:18:59,156 --> 00:19:03,326
front end work or backend work
because you see how it can impact

277
00:19:03,326 --> 00:19:09,926
things or how,you know,things,
uh,have to scale or,um,yeah,so

278
00:19:10,436 --> 00:19:12,936
that,that's why I move towards
that,that route.

279
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:16,521
Dan: I think you'd find that in
a,in a lot of small teams where

280
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:20,627
people are wearing lots of hats,
right.And,I've certainly,like,I

281
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:24,228
never considered myself a DevOps
engineer,you know,but I've

282
00:19:24,228 --> 00:19:28,907
certainly done a lot of things.
Engineer does.Right.You know,and

283
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:30,917
so like,I,I like your description
of,you know,seeing the big

284
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:34,758
picture and,and sort of having,
having an idea,uh,like a bird's

285
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:38,357
eye view of the whole ecosystem,
right.Of your app or your company

286
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:41,387
or,or whatever.Um,cuz there's
lots of pieces that go into it.

287
00:19:41,508 --> 00:19:45,377
Um,and it's a,I I just,uh,I
enjoyed your description of that.

288
00:19:45,377 --> 00:19:46,048
It's,it's cool.Cool.

289
00:19:47,472 --> 00:19:47,893
Carmen: Thanks.

290
00:19:49,742 --> 00:19:52,863
Bekah: So in a lot of this
journey,you talked about the

291
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:55,923
people who have been a part of
that journey and it seems like,

292
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:58,053
you know,developing those
relationships and those

293
00:19:58,053 --> 00:20:03,512
friendships have been really
important in your journey.So,um,

294
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:07,363
just what advice do you have for
our listeners out there about

295
00:20:07,742 --> 00:20:10,143
building those relationships and
especially like you talked about

296
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:16,232
being an introvert too,so how
does that play into it and,and

297
00:20:16,623 --> 00:20:20,567
how can other people.Get that
energy too.

298
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:27,617
Carmen: Uh,I think what really
helped was,uh,Having the

299
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:32,867
bootcamp,I went to be remote.I
never did remote school.Uh,so

300
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:38,597
like for,for example,when when I
got my,my degree,I,I think I made

301
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:45,198
two friends in college.Because I
was so shy,but when I,when I did

302
00:20:45,198 --> 00:20:49,817
the,the bootcamp and so I got
the,when I got my first job,I had

303
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:53,057
to sign my paperwork in Seattle,
but then I drove to Portland

304
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:56,087
because I made so many friends in
Portland and everyone,almost

305
00:20:56,093 --> 00:21:00,857
everyone in the cohort all met up
at a park.And we all,you know,I

306
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:04,637
don't,we all just wanted to be
friends and that's why I moved to

307
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:10,290
Portland.Uh,and I think,uh,I
think it's for,for introverts.

308
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:14,367
it's easier to make friends,I
guess,because,uh,remotely or like

309
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:19,452
online,because you know you're in
your safe space.You know,and,uh,

310
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:24,012
if something feels awkward or
unsafe,you can just close the

311
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:27,522
window and be like,whoops,power
went out.You know,like you,you

312
00:21:27,522 --> 00:21:33,823
have,uh,you have more escape
route,I guess.But,uh,joking

313
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:37,782
aside,um,what was really cool was
when I was first starting out,

314
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:43,718
um,I just started reaching out to
people when Twitter was a thing.

315
00:21:44,018 --> 00:21:47,468
I don't know if it's still a
thing,but I'm not on Twitter

316
00:21:47,468 --> 00:21:51,488
anymore,but when I was like,I
would watch like a,a,a YouTube

317
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:56,018
tutorial about how,how to use
some.Some package,some N P M

318
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:59,678
package,and I would directly go
and message this person and be

319
00:21:59,678 --> 00:22:02,678
like,Hey,th thanks this tutorial
really helped me do this.It's

320
00:22:02,678 --> 00:22:05,948
really cool.Like,would you have
time to like,you know,jump on a

321
00:22:05,952 --> 00:22:09,907
call or,or talk more about it?
And you,I was so shocked at first

322
00:22:09,968 --> 00:22:13,117
how many people were like,yeah,
let's do it.Cuz people just wanna

323
00:22:13,147 --> 00:22:16,567
nerd out and,and talk about the
work that they're doing.Cause

324
00:22:16,573 --> 00:22:20,188
they're excited and they,they
love what they do and.That's how

325
00:22:20,188 --> 00:22:23,877
um,I made a lot of,um,friends was
just reaching out to people cuz

326
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:26,637
they wanna talk about the things
that they're excited about

327
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:33,208
building.Uh,and then Virtual
Coffee too,like,uh,so we,uh,with

328
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:37,288
the stream end ending in a sense
of,you know,everyone life

329
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:42,853
happened and,uh,So,uh,you know,
everyone found jobs and,uh,moved

330
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:45,553
or,um,were on different time
zones,so we stopped doing the

331
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:50,113
stream and then I,I really leaned
on Virtual Coffee,uh,you know,

332
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:54,163
so,and then same thing,I would
just reach out to people and be

333
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:57,752
like,Hey,like,do you have time to
talk about this?And yeah,it's,

334
00:22:57,782 --> 00:23:01,813
it's been,I've had a really great
experience meeting people that

335
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:08,202
are just very welcoming and kind
and,uh,wanna just.Build cold

336
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:08,992
stuff together.

337
00:23:10,843 --> 00:23:14,563
Bekah: Yeah,I think that's great
that it,um,that's a lot of my

338
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:19,182
journey as well,and I didn't try
to come into tech,but like one of

339
00:23:19,182 --> 00:23:22,272
the things that brought me here
was the great community of

340
00:23:22,272 --> 00:23:25,603
people.So I was just kind of like
learning a little bit on my own,

341
00:23:25,603 --> 00:23:28,663
started tweeting about it,and
then people were so positive and

342
00:23:28,663 --> 00:23:31,752
like cheering me on if I had a
problem.Somebody would wanna

343
00:23:31,752 --> 00:23:34,752
help.And I was just shocked
because I had not experienced

344
00:23:34,752 --> 00:23:38,923
that in other ways.And like I,I
think that it really did help,

345
00:23:38,923 --> 00:23:44,323
like one that I was online and so
like that introvert to shyness

346
00:23:44,712 --> 00:23:48,522
kind of,it was much easier.But
then I,I was even reflecting on

347
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:53,502
this the other day,I feel like I
have overcome a lot of my shyness

348
00:23:53,502 --> 00:23:56,863
in the last couple of years
because of all of the positive

349
00:23:56,863 --> 00:24:01,827
interactions that I've had.And I
think it takes like one person

350
00:24:01,827 --> 00:24:05,488
saying something positive to you
to help you,like,move in the

351
00:24:05,488 --> 00:24:10,498
direction of like getting up the
courage to ask somebody for help

352
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:14,127
or sending that email like the
one that you sent to Joann.And I

353
00:24:14,127 --> 00:24:17,429
imagine like that experience was
it,was it nerve-wracking for you

354
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:20,278
to send him that email with all
of those questions?

355
00:24:21,553 --> 00:24:25,512
Carmen: Uh,Well,was it
nerve-wracking?No.Cuz it was like

356
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:30,343
my,like a Hail Mary because,uh,
everything kind of was a dumpster

357
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:34,002
fire at the moment.Like,uh,I had
to move in three days across the.

358
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:39,298
And live back with my,uh,with my
parents because like,you know,I

359
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:43,258
was unemployed and,uh,you know,
at that point I was like,I will,

360
00:24:43,768 --> 00:24:47,428
we'll see what happens.And if,if
they don't respond,that's fine,

361
00:24:47,728 --> 00:24:54,627
but it,it can't,it can't hurt to
ask.Right.Uh,so that,that's how I

362
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:59,248
felt.It's like if they don't have
the bandwidth to reply,then.Uh,

363
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,587
then they won't,but it's no harm
to just ask,uh,this and then

364
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,587
that.That's how I feel.It's like,
you know,you just,just ask.And if

365
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:11,458
someone has the time and the
bandwidth to,to reply and you

366
00:25:11,462 --> 00:25:15,718
know,and,and be there to help
you,they will.And I,I feel like

367
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,788
the same thing goes to like when
you're trying to find like a

368
00:25:17,788 --> 00:25:23,218
mentor or something.Uh,that was
another thing that,um,I

369
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:27,387
discovered,uh,well,I heard about
was like,you should get a mentor,

370
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:30,778
like that would help.And it's
like,how does one get mentor?You

371
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:33,417
know?How do you find that?Like,
it's not like they're,you know,

372
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:38,998
displayed or,uh,but it's,uh,it,
it,it's a,it's just asking.And

373
00:25:38,998 --> 00:25:41,538
then if that person does have the
time and wants to do it,they,

374
00:25:41,817 --> 00:25:47,218
they will or they'll say no,and
that's okay too.Um,Yeah,I forgot.

375
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:51,478
Was that the question?I think I,
I think I went off on that one.

376
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,738
Dan: We're big fans of tangents
here at Virtual Coffee Podcast,

377
00:25:56,147 --> 00:25:59,954
so,um,I like.What you talked
about with the mentorship too,

378
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:05,924
that I was wondering if you
could,um,talk a little bit more.

379
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,174
You don't have to like share
specific details if you don't

380
00:26:08,174 --> 00:26:11,204
want to,but,uh,about your
experience like finding a mentor

381
00:26:11,204 --> 00:26:14,414
and you know,how that worked.

382
00:26:16,184 --> 00:26:21,884
Carmen: Yeah.Yeah.Um,since I was
like on a,such a small team,uh,

383
00:26:22,545 --> 00:26:28,275
I.Yeah,I,I made it like my
mission to kind of try and find a

384
00:26:28,275 --> 00:26:30,704
way to work with people.Not
necessarily look for a mentor,

385
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:34,515
but,well,once I stepped into like
a,the,the DevOps position,I was

386
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:38,714
like,I need a mentor.I'm by
myself right now,and this is a

387
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:46,244
little daunting.Uh,and,uh,yeah,
I,I would just,uh,I reached out

388
00:26:46,244 --> 00:26:50,775
to some people and just asked,
uh,if it was,you know,front end

389
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:56,099
work or something,and,uh,I don't
know if it was luck or,or what,

390
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:59,430
but yeah,they were like,yeah,
let's set up weekly check-ins and

391
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:04,319
if you have any questions or
anything like that,we can discuss

392
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:10,769
it or work through a problem or
uh,uh,things like that.But,um,I

393
00:27:10,775 --> 00:27:14,700
think it's just asking,uh,I don't
know.

394
00:27:14,914 --> 00:27:18,454
Dan: Yeah.Yeah.So,so,so this was,
these were people like you didn't

395
00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:19,595
personally know yet,

396
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,369
Carmen: No,

397
00:27:21,275 --> 00:27:22,384
Dan: are,are the people you did
know.

398
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:24,234
Carmen: Mm.

399
00:27:24,585 --> 00:27:26,805
Dan: Yeah,you didn't know.And so
it was like kind of a cold call,

400
00:27:26,924 --> 00:27:29,714
you know,not cold call make,that
makes it sound bad,but like,you

401
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:33,855
know,uh,sort of out of the
blue-ish sort of thing,and you

402
00:27:33,855 --> 00:27:37,005
just asked,Hey,I am,you know,
doing this stuff.I was wondering

403
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:40,890
if you.time to be a mentor.I,I'm
asking because I really don't

404
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,559
like,this is something that I've
thought about myself a lot and

405
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,349
I've never got like,gotten
through actually following

406
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:49,650
through with it.And so I'm always
looking for advice as far as like

407
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,349
finding a mentor,uh,and that kind
of thing.So that's why I'm,

408
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,720
that's why I'm like,I keep asking
about it.

409
00:27:55,394 --> 00:27:59,505
Carmen: Yeah.Um,I think when I
was a junior developer,it was,

410
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:02,144
uh,when we were doing the stream
all the time,and there was one

411
00:28:02,144 --> 00:28:05,775
particular developer that showed
up every time we did the stream

412
00:28:05,775 --> 00:28:11,505
and had great advice to give,uh,
in the chat and just was like

413
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:15,944
supplemental,like on,on top of
like what we were,uh,what we were

414
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:20,355
giving and uh,just.Uh,I,I just
reached out to them after the

415
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:22,994
stream being like,thank you for
giving such great advice and

416
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:28,305
being,you know,so supportive to
others.Um,and then I was like,

417
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:31,605
well,gee,that's how I asked
there.And then,uh,for,for DevOps,

418
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:35,845
it was,uh,through Virtual Coffee,
just going to,to Virtual Coffee

419
00:28:35,904 --> 00:28:40,275
and then hearing,you know,you
know,when you do the intros and

420
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:44,474
then being like,Hey,like I,I,I
just stepped into DevOps,or I

421
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:50,140
have some questions.Or posting
in,uh,in Slack as well with

422
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,259
questions.And you know,the people
that have the bandwidth will

423
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:56,769
reply and then I would would
message them and be like,Hey,

424
00:28:56,769 --> 00:29:00,609
like,you know,have some more
questions.And do you,do you have

425
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:02,809
time?Uh,yeah.

426
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:05,295
Dan: I love that.

427
00:29:05,795 --> 00:29:08,384
Bekah: Yeah,I think that there
are a couple of things that I.I

428
00:29:08,384 --> 00:29:11,265
just wanna make sure that we
highlight here because it's said

429
00:29:11,265 --> 00:29:14,505
a lot of great things,like one,
if people have the bandwidth,

430
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:19,275
then they'll respond to you just.
It can be nerve wracking or scary

431
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:24,615
to send somebody a message and
ask for mentorship.And sometimes

432
00:29:24,615 --> 00:29:27,944
people will respond and sometimes
people won't respond,and that's

433
00:29:27,944 --> 00:29:32,565
okay.Like,that's not on you.
Right?That's,they might not have

434
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:38,204
that time or the capability to do
that.Right.Um,so I think that

435
00:29:38,295 --> 00:29:44,250
that idea like reach out and ask
you at the,the very least,They

436
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:49,559
might say,Hey,I'm,I can give you
a little bit of my time.Um,the

437
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,170
second thing that I wanna
highlight,you said you,when you

438
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,170
reached out to somebody,I,I think
that you said like,thank you for

439
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,619
those answers.Those were really
helpful.And so when you're asking

440
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:01,920
someone for something,you know,
it's nice to engage in that

441
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,099
conversation a little bit first
and let them know like that you

442
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:09,569
do appreciate what they've given
you already.And this has been a

443
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:12,984
really great place.This might be
a good place to start,like,uh,

444
00:30:13,015 --> 00:30:15,565
more of a relationship or deepen
that into some sort of

445
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:19,674
mentorship.And so I think that
like there are also,you mentioned

446
00:30:19,674 --> 00:30:22,674
like multiple modes of
mentorship,so that might be a

447
00:30:22,674 --> 00:30:25,404
one-on-one thing.It might be a
conversation with a group of

448
00:30:25,404 --> 00:30:29,634
people.It might be Slack messages
in a particular channel.Like all

449
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,414
of these things are mentorship.
Anything where you're learning

450
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:38,684
and growing,I think.Is a form of
mentorship,so sometimes it's

451
00:30:38,684 --> 00:30:42,464
important to think outside of
what the traditional definition

452
00:30:42,555 --> 00:30:44,085
of mentorship might be.

453
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:50,349
Carmen: Yeah.Yeah.Um,I agree.
Because sometimes it's just

454
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,759
having a place to rubber doc.
It's like you have a question and

455
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:58,390
then you write it all out,you
know,and then you send it and

456
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:02,680
it's like,oh,solve this.Thanks
for,you know,being a great

457
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:07,359
mentor.And it was just giving me
this space to send this to

458
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:14,769
someone.Uh,but yeah,it,it can
take many forms and,uh,yeah.It,

459
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:20,246
it's,it's.I think that was the,
biggest hurdle was just to,uh,to

460
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:24,653
know that,you know,just reach out
and,uh,if they don't respond,

461
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:28,432
that's okay.And if they respond
negatively,that's not someone

462
00:31:28,432 --> 00:31:34,613
that you should interact with.I
feel,uh,there's other options out

463
00:31:34,613 --> 00:31:41,317
there.Um,So,yeah.Yeah.Just,uh,
making it less daunting to,to

464
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:46,718
reach out to people that either
have good,uh,good feedback or

465
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:49,897
experience in things that you
wanna learn or do.Cause more than

466
00:31:49,897 --> 00:31:51,397
likely they wanna share it with,

467
00:31:54,028 --> 00:31:56,127
Bekah: Are there any specific
conversations that you can

468
00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:59,877
remember that really impacted
your journey or what you know

469
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:00,397
about DevOps?

470
00:32:01,742 --> 00:32:05,833
Carmen: I am still learning so
much,uh,constantly learning

471
00:32:06,123 --> 00:32:11,819
DevOps things.Uh,I don't know.
It,it's been a journey like,when

472
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:15,089
we were talking about dreams too,
it's like right now I,I was

473
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:20,684
working in Azure previously and
now I'm moving to a w s.And now

474
00:32:20,684 --> 00:32:25,095
I'm getting AWS certified.So my
dream about taking an exam and my

475
00:32:25,095 --> 00:32:30,525
alarm going off is very,is
accurate.I'm in the middle of

476
00:32:30,525 --> 00:32:36,075
studying for the,for aws,so

477
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:41,599
Bekah: Wow,that's,that's a lot.
Um,how are you balancing all of

478
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:45,900
this with.Work and being involved
in the community.

479
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:52,255
Carmen: Uh,gosh.Oh,you know,
it's,it's part of work.it's,you

480
00:32:52,255 --> 00:32:56,515
know,especially when you,you find
a,a job that invests in,in

481
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:59,634
furthering your education,cuz
they know that it will,it's

482
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:04,105
mutual.You learn,you know,and
that,that helps,um,your work.

483
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:08,711
it's setting,uh,calendar events,
you know,like this is the lot of

484
00:33:08,711 --> 00:33:13,309
time I have for coding stuff or
stuff in the code.And it's like

485
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,079
hard stop,don't keep,continue
down the rabbit hole.And then

486
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:23,058
it's shifting to,uh,to studying
and then learning.yeah.

487
00:33:24,227 --> 00:33:29,957
Dan: Was it their like idea to
get,get the AWS certification and

488
00:33:29,957 --> 00:33:32,267
all that stuff?Is it like a
requirement or anything?Or is it

489
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:35,557
just like,Hey,this might be fun
or something,you know,like how,

490
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:38,777
how did that,how.I least
suggested Yeah.That,that,

491
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:42,096
Carmen: and I was all for it.I,I
love learning and it's really

492
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:46,277
great and especially,you know,
shifting.Uh,From,from Azure to

493
00:33:46,487 --> 00:33:50,926
aws.There's,it's,it's similar
services.They're just name

494
00:33:50,926 --> 00:33:56,267
different things and it's knowing
the differences in names and

495
00:33:56,271 --> 00:34:02,987
they're,yeah.So,but the concepts
are all the same.How,how to,uh,

496
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:06,886
work in the cloud.Um,

497
00:34:07,717 --> 00:34:10,117
Dan: How to connect all the pipes
together.Just a whole set,

498
00:34:10,266 --> 00:34:13,237
separate set of acronyms to
memorize,right?

499
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:16,521
Carmen: so many acr.It's what one
of the whiteboards says is just

500
00:34:16,942 --> 00:34:17,501
acronyms.

501
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:21,021
Dan: Yeah.Yeah,that's one of my
biggest struggles.Cause I don't

502
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:25,101
like get into,into AWS stuff very
often.And so every time I do,I

503
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:27,862
have to like,refresh my memory
on,on all of it.Cuz it's like,

504
00:34:28,222 --> 00:34:31,101
cuz they internally re refer to
everything with their acronyms,

505
00:34:31,132 --> 00:34:35,271
you know?Um,and yeah,it,it can be
frustrating if you don't,if you

506
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:38,961
don't have it all in your brain.
Uh,so that's cool.So how's study?

507
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:43,791
So what does the exam like?Is it,
what does that experience look

508
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:46,342
like?Uh,not studying,but more of
like,do you know what the exam is

509
00:34:46,342 --> 00:34:50,541
going to look like?Is it.An hour
or I,I,I've never done that,so I,

510
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:54,652
I'd be curious to,you know,what
does an A certification entail?

511
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:59,856
Carmen: Oh yeah,so I'm not sure
how long it takes.I know that,

512
00:34:59,887 --> 00:35:06,637
um,you can choose to do it
remotely,uh,and you need to have

513
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:12,456
your laptop.Properly set up.And
you know,they,they,this is all

514
00:35:12,456 --> 00:35:15,847
I've heard,I don't know yet.Uh,
and you have to do a pretty

515
00:35:15,851 --> 00:35:21,786
rigorous process to prove that
you're not cheating.Uh,and so

516
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:27,052
then it's,people have been,uh,
Telling me to just go do it.I in

517
00:35:27,052 --> 00:35:31,431
a facility,in person,because then
it's less,uh,less of a headache

518
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:34,581
to get like,to proof that,you
know,there's no way you can cheat

519
00:35:34,586 --> 00:35:38,242
that,you know,your system is
good,uh,to take it remotely.But I

520
00:35:38,242 --> 00:35:43,072
have not looked into it further.
I'm still,uh,going through the

521
00:35:43,072 --> 00:35:45,202
tutorials to,to know all the
acronyms.

522
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:50,181
Dan: So,yeah,so it is a,it is
like a sort of traditional.

523
00:35:50,652 --> 00:35:51,072
Carmen: Mm-hmm.

524
00:35:51,771 --> 00:35:56,601
Dan: Like one time test thing,
like,like in school,right?Like,

525
00:35:57,231 --> 00:36:01,041
yeah.That's really interesting.
Yeah,that's,I could see how your

526
00:36:01,672 --> 00:36:04,101
subconscious would get,start to
get worried about something like

527
00:36:04,101 --> 00:36:08,831
that.I,uh,I haven't taken a test
for a long,long time,so it makes

528
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:10,152
me a little nervous just thinking
about it.

529
00:36:11,137 --> 00:36:14,737
Carmen: Yeah,I knew I was in a
dream though when like this

530
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:18,726
Scantron like where you have to
like shade in the bubble.It was

531
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:23,496
like really big and I was like,
this is ridiculous.Like this

532
00:36:23,496 --> 00:36:24,666
can't be real.

533
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:30,541
Dan: Remember to turn your phone
off,I guess,when you take the

534
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:31,061
test straight.

535
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:31,847
Carmen: Yeah.

536
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:36,786
Bekah: I wanted to circle back a
little bit,um,to what we were

537
00:36:36,786 --> 00:36:39,786
talking about before with meeting
new people and friendship

538
00:36:39,786 --> 00:36:43,327
building.Uh,cuz I,I think one of
the things that I.Heard a lot of

539
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:48,217
people say that,especially people
who are learning.I don't have the

540
00:36:48,217 --> 00:36:53,737
time to meet new people or to
join communities.It's

541
00:36:53,737 --> 00:36:58,206
overwhelming.Right.I also went to
a bootcamp.I was working,I had

542
00:36:58,206 --> 00:37:03,186
four kids and I was going to
bootcamp at the time,and it does

543
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:06,936
feel overwhelming.It feels like.
You can't put one more thing on

544
00:37:06,936 --> 00:37:10,387
your plate.And I imagine in a
similar circumstance,like what

545
00:37:10,387 --> 00:37:14,166
you're,you're working now,you are
studying for this exam,it can be

546
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:17,527
overwhelming.So in cases like
that,why do you think it is

547
00:37:17,532 --> 00:37:21,036
important to still maintain those
friendships or nurture those

548
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,806
relationships that you've built?

549
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:28,786
Carmen: Uh,yeah,because that's
what friends are for.They're your

550
00:37:28,786 --> 00:37:33,317
support system,right.Uh,and it's,
it's good to know that you're not

551
00:37:33,322 --> 00:37:37,246
alone.And,uh,that's why I make
it,like I,I put in my calendar

552
00:37:37,246 --> 00:37:42,106
Virtual Coffee,6:00AM Tuesdays,
you know,it's,uh,it's something

553
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:46,771
that I strive to,to make because
it's,it's.You know,you could,I

554
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:51,931
could be lost in AWS world and I
feel like,or nothing is working

555
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:55,052
in the code.And,you know,you feel
very isolated and then,you know,

556
00:37:55,052 --> 00:37:59,461
you,you,uh,you have a community
to go to and be like,Hey,I've

557
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:01,711
been down this rabbit hole too.
And it's like,you're not alone.

558
00:38:02,311 --> 00:38:07,141
And there is someone that can,
you know,either whether just to

559
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:11,731
listen or to,you know,It,it's,
uh,it's good to have if,if you

560
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:18,211
have,if you can,uh,in some way or
another,uh,whether it's,uh,going

561
00:38:18,211 --> 00:38:23,041
to an actual,like meetup
virtually or,or in person or,um,

562
00:38:23,132 --> 00:38:26,972
staying active on a Slack channel
or Discord.I,I was invited to a

563
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:29,731
lot of Discord channels and that
got overwhelming.I was like,I

564
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:34,021
can't do this.I can't,um,be
active on,on all of these

565
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:39,887
discords.But,um,yeah.Uh,I found
that was good.Or,or hack Tober

566
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:44,686
Fest too.That's also a really fun
way to,to meet people and to,to

567
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:50,836
directly work on things and help
each other out and,um,bond over,

568
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:55,817
you know,a PR or,uh,learn
something together.Um,that was

569
00:38:55,817 --> 00:38:59,746
another thing that I thought was
really daunting at first,uh,when

570
00:38:59,746 --> 00:39:03,976
I first started off,uh,was
contributing to like open source.

571
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:06,527
I thought that was extremely
daunting.Cause you don't know

572
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:10,726
them.And I was working on a small
team,so,uh,the whole,uh,poll

573
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:14,896
request and,uh,everything like
that wasn't as,uh,refined as some

574
00:39:15,077 --> 00:39:18,916
open source are.And that was
another thing a,a friend and I

575
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:23,186
did was we wanted to stream.Uh,
maintaining an open source

576
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:28,737
project on Octoberfest and,and,
uh,humanizing.What,what a PR is

577
00:39:28,737 --> 00:39:32,097
that it's not,it's not personal,
it's not a judgment on,on your

578
00:39:32,097 --> 00:39:36,507
code or anything like that.It's,
you know,the person,uh,the

579
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:40,597
maintainer,learning what you
wrote,and then,uh,offering

580
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:44,577
suggestions and then the,the
author learning something new

581
00:39:44,577 --> 00:39:51,422
maybe from that suggestion.Uh,so
that was,uh,another.Thing that I

582
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,972
thought was,uh,neat to do with
friends.

583
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:59,447
Bekah: That sounds awesome.Are
those videos still up somewhere

584
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:01,936
or are they gone?

585
00:40:02,521 --> 00:40:04,802
Carmen: I don't know.I don't
think so.Cause I think it

586
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:09,722
depends.I could check,but Twitch,
uh,Twitch doesn't keep videos

587
00:40:09,722 --> 00:40:13,771
after a while,and I think it's
been two years since we did that.

588
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:17,492
Uh,really wanted to continue
doing that,but,you know,life

589
00:40:17,492 --> 00:40:21,632
happens and it's,uh,you know,
especially,and streaming is,you

590
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:24,661
know,a whole,whole other world in
general because you have to make

591
00:40:24,661 --> 00:40:29,072
sure the,the stuff works and the
sound is heard and the music is

592
00:40:29,072 --> 00:40:32,311
heard.And you both,no,you're both
nodding.

593
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:36,692
Bekah: It was literally last I
decided to live stream this week.

594
00:40:37,246 --> 00:40:40,996
A couple of days ago,I was really
struggling to like,focus.I was

595
00:40:40,996 --> 00:40:43,726
really tired and I was like,
well,livestream and it'll make me

596
00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:46,996
accountable.Like I'll feel
accountable.And then like my

597
00:40:46,996 --> 00:40:50,536
sound wasn't working,my video
wasn't working.I'm like,this is

598
00:40:50,536 --> 00:40:54,978
not why I decided to livestream.
So then I was navigating those

599
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:59,387
problems live.Um,but it's okay.
Like I did,I didn't end up

600
00:40:59,387 --> 00:41:03,527
getting that.I merged in my own
pr.That's,that's just the way

601
00:41:03,532 --> 00:41:06,797
that I do things these days,this
morning.So,

602
00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:09,692
Carmen: you're not alone.Like
literally that was us every

603
00:41:09,692 --> 00:41:13,862
stream.Our sound never worked.We
would go live with no sound,not

604
00:41:13,862 --> 00:41:16,532
know until someone in the chat
would tell us that they can't

605
00:41:16,532 --> 00:41:21,791
hear us.And we just,so we knew
we'd have a good stream.So you,

606
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:28,231
you're not alone,but streaming as
a whole other beast.And uh,I

607
00:41:28,237 --> 00:41:31,021
commend anyone that does it and
maintains it.

608
00:41:32,896 --> 00:41:33,467
Bekah: Yeah,it can be.

609
00:41:33,931 --> 00:41:34,652
Dan: Oh,go ahead,Bekah.

610
00:41:34,817 --> 00:41:35,717
Bekah: No,you.

611
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,222
Dan: I was just gonna say,have
you been doing any streaming

612
00:41:38,282 --> 00:41:40,501
lately?Any code related stuff

613
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:45,106
Carmen: Uh,no,it would be so fun
to to,to get back into it.My,my

614
00:41:45,106 --> 00:41:47,717
friends and I,we,we talk about
it.The friends that I,I did

615
00:41:47,717 --> 00:41:52,036
streaming with,uh,uh,we're such
good friends now.I'm even in one

616
00:41:52,036 --> 00:41:53,206
of their weddings.Like,

617
00:41:53,452 --> 00:41:54,211
Dan: Oh,nice.

618
00:41:54,376 --> 00:42:02,371
Carmen: really cool.But,uh,it's,
uh,No,no.Life happens.I moved and

619
00:42:02,371 --> 00:42:05,972
started a new job and someone
else moved to Europe and we're on

620
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:11,492
a12hour difference and it's,uh,
it's been hard to,to stream.

621
00:42:11,492 --> 00:42:15,121
Maybe one day it would be,it
would be cool to,to do again.

622
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:20,416
Dan: can be hard to even,even if
you're just doing it by yourself,

623
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:23,987
it's can be really hard to keep,
keep anything like that up,you

624
00:42:23,987 --> 00:42:26,806
know?Especially when you have
other people involved.Yeah.Life,

625
00:42:26,867 --> 00:42:28,876
like you said,life,life happens.
Can be tough.

626
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,501
Bekah: Yeah,I think it's
important to prioritize those

627
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:34,891
things that.Are working for you
too,right?And like I think

628
00:42:34,891 --> 00:42:40,202
sometimes when it starts to feel
like that extra thing is a drag

629
00:42:40,202 --> 00:42:43,322
and you don't wanna do it
anymore,or you know,it's just

630
00:42:43,322 --> 00:42:46,351
like overwhelming to think about
it,then that's probably like the

631
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,362
time to let it go for a little
bit.

632
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:52,447
Carmen: Yeah,I,I completely
agree.That's how I felt,uh,

633
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:55,597
about,uh,yeah,the first time I
did hack Octoberfest when we were

634
00:42:55,597 --> 00:42:59,586
trying to stream it,maintain an
open source,do all of the things,

635
00:42:59,586 --> 00:43:02,706
and it's like,this is supposed to
be fun.If it's getting stressful,

636
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:06,606
let's stop.Cuz it's supposed to
be for fun.It's supposed to be

637
00:43:06,606 --> 00:43:09,637
to,to help people and educate
people.But if it's starting to

638
00:43:09,637 --> 00:43:13,206
turn into a stressor,then it's,
uh,no know your limits and

639
00:43:13,206 --> 00:43:17,047
boundaries and yeah,be kind to
yourself.Um,cause something's

640
00:43:17,047 --> 00:43:20,577
gonna,Uh,yeah.Suffer in it.

641
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:25,108
Bekah: Yeah,and I think.this is
kind of a tangent,but like taking

642
00:43:25,108 --> 00:43:28,349
a personal inventory is something
that we've talked about,uh,in the

643
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:31,259
last couple of months at Virtual
Coffee.Just to kind of see where

644
00:43:31,259 --> 00:43:34,048
you are,where you are,like what
your needs are,what your

645
00:43:34,048 --> 00:43:38,518
strengths and weaknesses are,but
also to kind of identify those

646
00:43:38,518 --> 00:43:42,028
types of things.You know,if
you're feeling overwhelmed by is

647
00:43:42,028 --> 00:43:45,628
this,you might have needed that
thing three months ago and it

648
00:43:45,628 --> 00:43:48,418
might have been really good for
you in that moment,or like that

649
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,528
community that you're a part of.
That was really great for you

650
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:54,918
last year,but it's not so great
for you this year and like

651
00:43:54,918 --> 00:43:58,668
recognizing that like,hey,we
change and we grow as people and

652
00:43:58,668 --> 00:44:03,139
we have different needs all the
time.Figuring out like what is

653
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:06,619
helping me to accomplish the
things that I need to be doing

654
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:10,789
every single day is really
important,but also like sometimes

655
00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:15,523
really hard to identify If you
don't stop for a second.And,and

656
00:44:15,523 --> 00:44:18,764
really think about like,what is
enriching my life right now?What

657
00:44:18,764 --> 00:44:23,204
is helping me be the person that
I wanna be,rather than like,this

658
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:26,804
was helping me three months ago.
It should still be helping me

659
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:28,704
now,and then trying to power
through it.

660
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,278
Carmen: Mm-hmm.Yeah,I agree.

661
00:44:34,215 --> 00:44:40,036
Bekah: Um,okay.So I guess maybe
one way that we can start to wrap

662
00:44:40,036 --> 00:44:45,766
things up here is talking about
that introverted experience and

663
00:44:45,856 --> 00:44:49,876
what advice you have for
individuals who are feeling

664
00:44:50,175 --> 00:44:55,246
really nervous about coming into
tech and interviewing for their

665
00:44:55,246 --> 00:44:58,635
first or second job.Because I
think that,you know,being an

666
00:44:58,635 --> 00:45:04,231
introvert makes it.Maybe a little
bit harder to interview for that

667
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:08,490
job and to be able to find those
connections.So do you have any

668
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:13,081
advice for how to approach that
in a way that doesn't seem

669
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:13,891
overwhelming?

670
00:45:14,498 --> 00:45:20,704
Carmen: Um,gosh.It's,uh,it's hard
for me to answer this one because

671
00:45:20,704 --> 00:45:24,333
both of my,like interviews in
tech have been very,uh,

672
00:45:24,364 --> 00:45:28,563
non-traditional because,uh,first
one was an internship and it was

673
00:45:28,568 --> 00:45:34,373
just like,I like you,you like me,
let's be a happy DevOps family

674
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:38,884
type of thing.And then the second
job was actually through,uh,a

675
00:45:38,884 --> 00:45:43,443
friend I made in Virtual Coffee.
So,uh,both of them were very

676
00:45:43,503 --> 00:45:47,719
non-traditional because they were
like,I know that you know the

677
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:52,128
things cuz you talk about them in
Virtual Coffee.So I don't need to

678
00:45:52,128 --> 00:45:55,188
interview you technically about
the things,and it's like,I wanna

679
00:45:55,188 --> 00:46:01,159
work with you.Uh,so I guess,uh,
that's one way to go about it is

680
00:46:01,188 --> 00:46:03,969
make friends and then friends
wanna work with friends because

681
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:10,369
you,you get along,you know,uh,
you,you know how each other.Tick

682
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:15,018
kind of.So it's like,you know how
to approach each other.Uh,so,so I

683
00:46:15,018 --> 00:46:16,958
guess that's one way of going
about it.

684
00:46:18,798 --> 00:46:21,619
Bekah: I,I think that's really
great advice,right?Like making

685
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:25,639
those connections can help ease
that interview process for sure.

686
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:32,748
And that's been.All of my jobs in
tech too,I think.Uh,and it,it

687
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:36,139
didn't start with meeting people.
It started with tweeting about it

688
00:46:36,139 --> 00:46:38,869
and then writing about it and
then talking about it in

689
00:46:38,873 --> 00:46:44,673
different ways.And so maybe like
there's,I.There's a place where

690
00:46:44,673 --> 00:46:48,634
you feel kind of comfortable or
you don't feel as uncomfortable

691
00:46:48,634 --> 00:46:52,143
or as exhausted from those
interactions,and you can still

692
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:54,994
have a community and you can
still meet people if you're

693
00:46:54,994 --> 00:46:58,054
blogging about it or if you're
writing about it,or if you post a

694
00:46:58,054 --> 00:47:01,313
YouTube video.You don't have to
have that face-to-face

695
00:47:01,313 --> 00:47:04,983
interaction.But I do think that
it's easier to have that

696
00:47:04,983 --> 00:47:08,824
face-to-face interaction once
you've engaged with people on

697
00:47:09,184 --> 00:47:10,233
other platforms.

698
00:47:12,164 --> 00:47:16,083
Carmen: Yeah.Yeah,definitely.
And,and also you're interviewing

699
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:20,403
them,like,do you wanna work with.
Best person,so I guess it goes

700
00:47:20,403 --> 00:47:21,273
both ways.

701
00:47:22,804 --> 00:47:25,744
Bekah: Yeah,absolutely.All right,
Carmen,thanks so much for being

702

here with us today and sharing
your story.We really appreciate

703

704
00:47:32,824 --> 00:47:35,853
are going through some struggles
now and have in the past,and

705
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:39,423
feeling like they're not alone in
that experience.So thanks so much
