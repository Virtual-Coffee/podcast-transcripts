00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,437
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 5, Episode 6

2
00:00:09,437 --> 00:00:11,267
of the

3
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:14,007
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

4
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:16,746
that

5
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:20,407
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

6
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:21,696
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

7
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:22,985
their

8
00:00:22,986 --> 00:00:25,417
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

9
00:00:25,417 --> 00:00:26,886
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

10
00:00:26,886 --> 00:00:28,355
it with

11
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:30,847
you. Here with me today is my
cohost, Dan.

12
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:35,421
Dan Ott: Hello, Bekah. Today,
we're talking with Andrew Bush.

13
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:38,121
Andrew is a mobile engineer
specializing in React Native.

14
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,821
And so, if

15
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:44,301
you've been to virtualcoffee.io
recently and checked out

16
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:45,626
our members page, you might have
noticed, we now have -- we have

17
00:00:45,626 --> 00:00:46,951
all

18
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:51,301
of our members there, and now we
have a little tags that say what

19
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:53,000
roles that they have if- if
people are, you know,

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,091
volunteering, helping

21
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:57,432
out in Virtual Coffee. And so,
Andrew is one of the people that

22
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,991
has been helping out with us for
a while. He's been doing --

23
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,550
he's

24
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:02,951
been helping lead the Monthly
Challenge team for the

25
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:05,351
past ...

26
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:07,700
I don't know. How long has he
been? [Chuckles] I'm- I'm not

27
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,231
sure. I can't

28
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:09,822
remember off the top of my head
how long. But it feels like a

29
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:10,121
while.

30
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:11,171
Bekah: [Laughs] Well, it is. It
is been a while. Yeah.

31
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:12,701
Dan: It feels -- yeah. It feels
like to me, it's been while.

32
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:12,861
And- and --

33
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:14,331
Bekah: Since last year, for
sure.

34
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:18,087
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. And so, monthly
challenges, you can read more

35
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:20,546
about on our site as well. But
we do a different challenge

36
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:22,811
every month. And- and, yeah. So
Andrew has been helping lead

37
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:25,076
that

38
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:29,300
group along with Aurelie and --
who was on the podcast-

39
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:29,500
Bekah: Yes.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,700
Dan: -season ... I don't
remember which season-

42
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,000
Bekah: All that season throw
together [??][chuckles].

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,647
Dan: -she was on. Yeah, yeah.
She was on- [laughs] she was

44
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:37,887
on a while ago too. So, yeah. We
talked about that for a while.

45
00:01:37,887 --> 00:01:40,271
And Andrew, also, he kind of
talked about, you know, what

46
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:42,655
it's

47
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,266
been like leading the- leading
the group and helping, you

48
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:48,177
know, facilitates challenges,
stuff like that. And we also

49
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:50,697
talked a while about, you know,
what it's like to be a mobile

50
00:01:50,697 --> 00:01:54,266
developer, some of his
experiences with React Native

51
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:56,846
and, of course, his journey
through his career.

52
00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:59,326
Bekah: Yeah. It was great
talking about that. And I li-

53
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:00,750
really love

54
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:02,700
that the tags recognize our
members and what they're doing.

56
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,300
I mean, not just because we
wanna recognize our members, but

57
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,780
also

58
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:08,596
it helps other people to see
who's doing what and how they

59
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,411
can

60
00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:13,991
get involved in Virtual Coffee.
And we actually have a new get

61
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:16,646
involved section on the site. So
if anybody is out there and

62
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:19,301
wants

63
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:23,171
to add a tag to their name, can
fill out one of those forms and

64
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:24,701
we can [laughs] --

65
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,287
Dan: And they can get involved
[laughs].

66
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:27,896
Bekah: Yep [laughs]. That was
good.

67
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:32,836
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. So if you're
listening and you wanna check

69
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:34,336
that out, it's in the resources
section,

70
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:38,947
virtualcoffee.io/resources. And
then, I dunno. Click through in

71
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:42,336
there. It's in there somewhere.
So, yeah. It was a good

72
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,766
episode overall and I know
you're going to enjoy it.

73
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:48,752
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast like we start every

74
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,211
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

75
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:54,500
we're from, what we do, and a
random check-in question. We

77
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:06,000
hope you enjoy this episode. Our
intro question is, if you could

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,723
live in

79
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:13,112
an animated movie, what would it
be? My name is Bekah. I am a

80
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:16,007
technical community builder from
a small town in Ohio, and I

81
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:18,902
would live

82
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:27,527
in ... I feel like it needs to
have some kind of magical aspect

83
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:33,500
to it, because that would be
more fun. I was going to say

84
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:33,857
"Beauty

85
00:03:33,858 --> 00:03:38,828
And The Beast" cuz that's my
favorite movie. I'll just stick

86
00:03:38,828 --> 00:03:39,307
with that.

87
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:46,043
Dan: Pre beast conversion or
post? Like, is he still The

88
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:50,723
Beast? Basically, I mean -- and
all the other, you know, fun --

89
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:52,902
Bekah: Yeah. Cuz there's no more
magic if he's not The Beast.

90
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:54,300
Dan: Right [chuckles]. Right,
right. That's my -- that was

91
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,622
my question.

92
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:55,633
Bekah: It's kinda boring.

93
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:57,562
Dan: But if he's The Beast,
then, you know, you got a whole

94
00:03:57,562 --> 00:03:58,913
other problem to deal with.

95
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,853
Bekah: Yeah. I wonder if his fur
is soft.

96
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:04,362
Dan: You know, I actually just
watched it with the kids.

97
00:04:04,362 --> 00:04:06,132
They -- you

98
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:08,112
know, it was their first time,
like, a week or two ago. I don't

99
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:12,402
watch it for a long time. S-so,
like, all the furniture are his

100
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:15,000
servants or whatever, his
household staff. Well, what --

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,632
like, did

102
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,512
he not have furniture at all
before that? [Bekah laughs] Or

103
00:04:19,512 --> 00:04:22,392
did they all turn

104
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:23,877
into furniture and then they,
like, just threw out the

105
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:26,713
existing, non-alive furniture?

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Bekah: Well, I don't think
everybody is furniture. I think

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,362
it's kind of got that Encanto
vibe,

108
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:33,500
where there's like magic in the
house. So, like, the head of all

109
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,793
of the cups is Mrs.

110
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:39,023
Pots. But not every cup is a
household worker. They just have

111
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:40,252
the magic now.

112
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:42,981
Dan: Oh, wait. You're -- so
you're saying, like, alive cups,

113
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:44,886
but they weren't

114
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:46,475
actually people before. They
just like --

115
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,451
Bekah: Ye- right. Just like-

116
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:48,725
Dan: The magic is like turning
-- okay.

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Bekah: -Mrs. Pots, and Chip,
like, they were people. But

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,500
there are other cups that move
around and do things-

119
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:53,700
Dan: Uh-huh.

120
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,300
Bekah: -but that's just the
magic that is commanding the-

121
00:04:56,485 --> 00:04:56,815
Dan: Got it. Got it.

122
00:04:58,071 --> 00:04:59,091
Bekah: -enchanting the house.

123
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:06,076
Dan: [Laughs] Okay. Alright. Hi,
I'm Dan. I do web development in

124
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,500
Cleveland, Ohio. And, I think,
the first thing that

125
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,700
popped in my mind was "Moana".
The, you know, the life there

126
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,386
seems pretty

127
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:17,596
simple, you know? On an island
plus canoeing is one of my

128
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:22,605
favorite things and, so, that'd
be cool. Maui seems like a

129
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:25,700
cool hang. So I'm- I'm going
with- I'm going with Moana as

130
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,826
my- as my animated universe to
live in.

131
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:29,985
Bekah: Are you taking your rain
shell with you?

132
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:31,745
Dan: Uh, probably. I won't have
to use it very much. But, you

133
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:34,385
know, that -- I'm sure it rains
there sometimes. There's like a

134
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:35,405
rainy season,

135
00:05:35,406 --> 00:05:37,570
right? I would- I would think.
Thanks for- thanks for that

136
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,734
[chuckles].

137
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:42,070
Bekah: Just making sure you had
it. I know it's important to

138
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,285
you.

139
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:45,607
Dan: It is.

140
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:47,916
Andrew Bush: And I'm Andrew. And
I'm a mobile developer in the

141
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:57,247
React Native space based out of
Wisconsin. I- I think I'd

142
00:05:57,247 --> 00:06:02,857
live in the valley in Encanto,
but I have a bit of a recency

143
00:06:02,857 --> 00:06:06,547
bias. I just, like, that's the
most recent animated film I've

144
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:09,839
seen. But I- I -- the -- in the
intro sequence, there's these --

145
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,131
so it -- it's

146
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:14,902
in Columbia. And then the intro
sequence, there's these kids

147
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:17,856
who, like, are, like, running
with little cups of coffee, and

148
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:20,706
they're shaking, and the coffee
splashing out of the cups. I'd

149
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:23,872
be like one of those little
kids. That's my vibe.

150
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:24,822
Dan: Nice.

151
00:06:24,822 --> 00:06:27,314
Bekah: Yeah. [Chuckles] that is
-- my- my kids love, or my

152
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:29,806
five-year-old

153
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:32,532
loves that part where she says
-- Mirabel- Mirabel says,

154
00:06:32,532 --> 00:06:35,257
"That's

155
00:06:35,257 --> 00:06:38,347
why coffee is for grownups."
They just laugh. Every single

156
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:41,437
time [Andrew chuckles].

157
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:43,101
So, welcome, Andrew. Thank you
so much for being here with us

158
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:44,765
for

159
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:49,987
this episode of our podcast. And
we always like to get started

160
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:53,887
with the origin story of each of
our guests. So what brought you

161
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:58,416
here to the state of your Andrew
developer career?

162
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:01,466
Andrew: All right. I should've
expected a question like this. I

163
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:04,139
gotta work on my elevator pitch
anyway. Yeah, it's sort of

164
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,812
a ...

165
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,062
I don't know if there is a
traditional path, but I would

166
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,262
say

167
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:15,791
mine is non-traditional. I --
the first time I ever wrote code

168
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:21,822
was HTML, not even like
full-blown HTML. Just tags to

169
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:25,706
make my- my MySpace page cooler.
And then, like, a long time

170
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:29,590
later,

171
00:07:29,862 --> 00:07:34,802
I thought I'd go to school for
that. And, you know, that

172
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:37,487
didn't go super well- [laughs]
super well for me. I -- my major

173
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:40,172
wasn't

174
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:45,182
partying, so they kicked me out.
And, you know, I did -- you

175
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:48,000
know, after sorta like, you
know, trying to figure out what

176
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,476
I wanted to be when I grow up
for many years, I was like, you

177
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:56,221
know, I actually really liked
programming and I really liked

178
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:58,471
web development, specifically.
So I- I have sort of sorted

179
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:00,721
things

180
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:04,442
out. And I, actually, I went
back to school again, got an

181
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,002
associates degree and- and
thought, "All right. I just need

182
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:07,562
to get a

183
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:12,091
job. I need to get into the
space." And I- I took an

184
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,551
interview for, like, a ve- a
very generic you're gonna write

185
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:17,011
code, but

186
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:20,851
they didn't tell me what. And I
ended up writing React Native

187
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:25,051
code. And I did not expect to be
in a mobile developer space.

188
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:30,422
And I actually really enjoyed
it. And that's where I've stuck

189
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:34,056
since then. And that's gotten me
to here.

190
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:37,039
Bekah: Yeah. I -- so, this is
always been fascinating to me

191
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,839
because I

192
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,623
don't know that many React
Native developers. So can you

193
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:42,407
talk a

194
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:46,300
little bit about how you ended
up there? Cuz it's not, you

195
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,609
know, at least, I don't know a
ton of people doing React Native

196
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:53,000
development. First of all, wait.
Maybe let's pause [chuckles].

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,889
And what is

198
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:57,469
React Native development? And
then answer my other question.

199
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:04,779
Andrew: All right. Yeah. So
React Native is a cross-platform

200
00:09:05,471 --> 00:09:12,221
framework for ... mobile apps.
They are into the web space now.

201
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:16,510
So you can write all in one
stack and then deploy wherever.

202
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,300
But yeah, the original intention
is so that you can have, you

203
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,780
know, a single

204
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,341
codebase in single skill sets to
be able to write Android and iOS

205
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:30,461
applications. Because native
Android applications are

206
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:32,620
gonna be in Java or Kotlin and
na-native iOS, that's gonna

207
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,779
be in

208
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,360
Swift. So, rather than having,
you know, especially in a

209
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,421
professional environment
distinct teams, knowing distinct

210
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:43,841
stacks, and trying to always
keep those things in sync, React

211
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:48,416
Native is one of the solutions
that was out there. At -- when

212
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:52,405
I first started, we started with
Native Scripts, which is just

213
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:53,965
another one of the options out
there, and then ended up

214
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:55,525
pivoting

215
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:58,645
because of the community support
for React Native it's made by

216
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:02,700
Facebook. So there's just a lot
of support and fu-funding behind

217
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:09,505
it. But, yeah. It's -- at its
core, it's JavaScript. But

218
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,166
professionally, I've always used
TypeScript on top of it.

219
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:17,272
Dan: That's cool. And so, does
that work out? From what I

220
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:19,162
understand, I've never really
worked in it, except from

221
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:21,052
dabbling.

222
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:24,841
But from what I understand, you
have the ability to do some

223
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:29,000
native stuff, if you need to, or
whatever, in, like, real app,

224
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,700
you know, in- in non-classroom
apps that you'd like the kind of

225
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,101
stuff

226
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:33,736
you're actually working on. Do
-- does the cross-platform

227
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:35,371
thing,

228
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:39,781
like, honestly, like, work out
really well, as oppo- like,

229
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:42,200
or do you need to -- do you end
up having to do, like, little --

230
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,812
weird little

231
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:45,500
things for- for, you know, for
different platforms from time

232
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:45,990
to time?

233
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:53,067
Andrew: Yeah. Well, it -- in my
experience, which I would,

234
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:55,829
you know — for context, I've-
I've been doing this for -- I've

235
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:59,639
been doing it professionally for
about three years. So, in my

236
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,769
experience,

237
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:07,438
rarely do we actually need to
write native code. Occasionally,

238
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,500
you'll f- run into, like, I'd --
we had some weird issue with

239
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,488
splash screens

240
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:16,239
at my previous job, and the
solution wasn't native solution.

241
00:11:16,328 --> 00:11:20,019
But a lot of times you find you
can just get a package that'll

242
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:25,778
handle that for you. But, yeah.
Actually, most things are

243
00:11:25,778 --> 00:11:31,989
pretty seamless. The- the -- I
guess the overhead you get is

244
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,557
recognizing that since it builds
across multiple platforms, it's

245
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:40,463
not always gonna, like, com-
when it gets compiled, it's not

246
00:11:40,463 --> 00:11:42,368
going

247
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:47,408
to behave in exactly the same
way every time. There's always

248
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:51,249
like little corks and sometimes
it's specifically on device. So

249
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:54,114
we've got, like, we -- when-
when you write it, you --

250
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,979
frequently,

251
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:59,700
when you're delving, you're,
like, using a simulator or an

252
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,500
emulator. And -- but then, like,
before you roll out to

253
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,952
production and — as our QA

254
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:10,403
is telling me when I'm doing dev
work — to -- I need to test on

255
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:13,854
physical device because that
uncovers more issues that you

256
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:17,300
don't see. So that's like the
big thing with it, I guess. More

257
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,471
so than ... I dunno. I sort of
lost the plot there [chuckles].

258
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:23,736
Dan: More so than- than
different platforms and stuff

259
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:25,101
is- is really

260
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:27,700
just a -- if- if I can
understand what you're saying,

261
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,431
more- more of the

262
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:32,312
fact that you're working
specifically for a -- you know,

263
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:34,741
you're building an app for a
device that somebody holds in

264
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:38,221
their hand, right? And so -- as
opposed to something on a screen

265
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:38,500
with a-

266
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:38,700
Andrew: Right.

267
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,261
Dan: -mouse or another pointer
device.

268
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:40,932
Andrew: Right.

269
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:43,000
Dan: So, yeah. That seems like
probably- probably good advice.

270
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,700
Probably easy to forget when
you're- when you're in the

271
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,700
weeds, you know? Kinda been
developing for a long time on a-

272
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,197
on a thing, and just looking at
your simulator on your computer.

273
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:53,446
I certainly, like -- just even
on websites have that same

274
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:54,975
thing,

275
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:58,216
right- right? I forget -- I look
at it, you know, I see what

276
00:12:58,216 --> 00:13:01,000
it looks like on the iPhone, you
know, a simulator or the --

277
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,500
that- that in dev tools even,
you know? Which is even another

278
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,500
further step removed from the
actual thing, right? But it's

279
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:07,876
always

280
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:10,846
good to take a pass, you know?
See what it feels like, swiping

281
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:13,667
things or- or just scrolling,
like, outlook scrolling on the

282
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:16,201
-- on your ... you know, for an
iPhone, at least, it has the --

283
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:18,196
what you

284
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,157
call the scroll that keeps going
when you- when you flick it?

285
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:24,062
I can't remember what it's
called. But there's- there's a

286
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:25,922
name for it. But like on an
iPhone, when you scroll, you

287
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:27,076
know, everyone who used to it,
you scroll with your finger, and

288
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:30,000
you kinda flick it, and it keeps
going, right?

289
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,300
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

290
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,532
Dan: Which is what most

291
00:13:31,532 --> 00:13:35,761
people on computers, you know,
are using -- don't have

292
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:38,461
that, right? They're using a
touchpad or a scroll bar,

293
00:13:38,522 --> 00:13:40,700
whatever, and it stops
[chuckles], right? And that

294
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,522
experience is a little

295
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:43,111
bit different. You're gonna see
some -- you're gonna see

296
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:46,682
things. Especially if you have
interaction going on,

297
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:50,000
you know? It -- scroll
interaction, things like that.

298
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,427
It seems like a pretty important
step to- to take. So --

299
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:53,300
Andrew: That seems-

300
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:53,500
Dan: That's --

301
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:59,000
Andrew: -actually really
interesting. The -- I don't --

302
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,075
I -- is -- there

303
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:01,591
might be a specific name for it.
I'm- I'm not thinking of it

304
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,106
either,

305
00:14:03,106 --> 00:14:04,636
but, like, you know, continuous
scrolling or maybe something

306
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,166
like

307
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:10,697
that. But yeah, that is -- it's
interesting when developing and

308
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:14,761
it -- there are certain things
that each platform will natively

309
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:18,825
do on its

310
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:26,417
own. And ... in my experience, I
try and create apps that are

311
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:31,336
consistent. So, an iOS user, I
want them to see exactly what an

312
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:33,506
Android user sees. But you also
have to be aware of -- well,

313
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,676
what

314
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:39,362
are platform specific things
that say an i- iPhone user is

315
00:14:39,362 --> 00:14:43,037
going to

316
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:46,000
expect when they're in their
apps, right? Navigation is one-

317
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,300
Dan: Absolutely.

318
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,551
Andrew: -right?

319
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:51,451
iPhones don't have hardware
buttons for back navigation,

320
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:52,816
that's, like, by default.
They've got -- they usually have

321
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:54,181
a little

322
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:59,000
back arrow in the corner. But,
yeah, to that scrolling ...

323
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:05,312
it's interesting. On those types
of scrollable things in apps,

324
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:08,500
there's a really slick
animation, I think, that just

325
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,481
kinda is native

326
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:14,000
to iOS, that when you get to --
it does that infinite scroll.

327
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And I just think it looks really
smooth. And you get to the

328
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,687
bottom of the

329
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:21,437
list, and it kinda bounces there
at the bottom. And I think

330
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:22,000
it looks really good-

331
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,300
Dan: Yeah.

332
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,856
Andrew: -and that just doesn't
happen natively on

333
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:26,000
Android. And it's like --

334
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,500
Dan: Hmm.

335
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Andrew: Hmm.

336
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,468
Dan: Yeah. So I looked it up at
the -- it- it's called momentum

337
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:32,236
scrolling.

338
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:36,677
And I think that includes that
scroll past that exact

339
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:40,516
behavior you're talking about.
But it -- so it's -- cuz it is

340
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:41,446
cool and I've- I've, like,
looked at it and tried to

341
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:42,375
recreate it a

342
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:45,197
couple of times in- in
JavaScript, whatever. But it- it

343
00:15:45,197 --> 00:15:48,256
does have -- momentum just going
-- it's a great name for it. Cuz

344
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:49,861
it's like -- it really does, you
flick it, and- and it starts

345
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:51,466
fast,

346
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:54,721
and goes -- and it slows down,
and stuff like that. Anyway.

347
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:58,951
Momentum scrolling. [Laughs]
That's- that's what it's called.

348
00:15:59,032 --> 00:15:59,700
Bekah: This has been a really
long-

349
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,000
Dan: It's cool.

350
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,611
Bekah: -week. And in my mind, I
was,

351
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:05,000
like, I want that to be my
nickname [laughs]. Like, that

352
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,581
doesn't make any sense, but I
like it [laughs].

353
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,871
Andrew: I'd say by itself,
momentum is a pretty cool

354
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:12,412
nickname.

355
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:14,042
Dan: Yeah.

356
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:14,152
Bekah: Yeah.

357
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:15,592
Andrew: The scrolling part is
sort of weird to assign to a

358
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:17,032
human.

359
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,700
Bekah: Hmm, yeah [laughs]. I'm
not sure where to go with that

360
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,500
either. So, I wanna -- I have
some minimal experience with

361
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,006
React Native. And --

362
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:31,486
so one of the questions people
ask me all the time is, "Well,

363
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:33,586
what's the difference? Like, how
-- what's the learning curve

364
00:16:33,586 --> 00:16:35,686
from

365
00:16:35,716 --> 00:16:40,517
React to React Native?" which I
actually think that React Native

366
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:45,047
is easier to learn. But I say
that as somebody who learned

367
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,537
React first. I dunno if you have
any thoughts on that,

368
00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:50,716
Andrew. I just like, you know,
"Here's a view. This is -- it's

369
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:52,907
not a div. It's a- it's a view."
That makes sense to me.

370
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:55,316
Andrew: Yeah. I've gone the
other way. I wouldn't say I've

371
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:56,681
learned

372
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:02,022
React, so to speak. I- I sort of
vicariously have, by doing React

373
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,301
Native. But, yeah. I went the
other way. I started with React

374
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:07,511
Native, and I've done some
dabbling in React. [Silence] I

375
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:10,721
think ...

376
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:16,000
ye- right. The- the distinct
differences I noticed, one, is

377
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,146
like in the JSX. So, where
you're using traditional HTML

378
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:21,876
type tags, you

379
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:24,636
just -- you don't use those in
React Native. You use

380
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:32,727
traditional native tags. I
remember seeing, like, view ...

381
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:38,606
scroll view, text input, like,
very -- these very declarative

382
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:42,326
names. I did a little bit of
development in Xamarin in

383
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:47,366
college, and that was a mobile
framework that uses, like, XML

384
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:51,000
type markup, and it had very
similar naming structures. So,

385
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,537
like, that- that stuff was super
familiar to me. But, yeah. I

386
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:57,821
find, like, it -- that's -- that
kinda stuff just makes sense.

387
00:17:57,821 --> 00:18:01,105
[Silence] Yeah. I

388
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:09,300
think, really, the other sort of
-- it's more of a -- like a

389
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,500
mental contextual shift between
the two. Like, knowing that

390
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,786
you're working on a

391
00:18:14,787 --> 00:18:18,356
mobile device. That it receives
taps, it doesn't receive clicks.

392
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:21,700
It receives, like, swipes and,
you know, it's -- you gotta just

393
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,247
be aware of the user experience
is very different. I think of,

394
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:33,596
like, our -- another member of
VC, Luis, he coincidentally

395
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:37,323
joined my team and -- at- at- at
work. And he had never done

396
00:18:37,323 --> 00:18:40,990
React

397
00:18:40,991 --> 00:18:45,281
Native. And he ramped up so
fast. He had React experience.

398
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:50,741
And he was instantly making
contributions. So I think,

399
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:54,402
yeah. One- one skill set can
really help you with the other.

400
00:18:56,942 --> 00:18:59,552
Bekah: Yeah. I- I -- for sure.
And it's interesting because I

401
00:18:59,552 --> 00:19:02,162
heard

402
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:05,551
somebody talking about React
Native documentation once, where

403
00:19:05,882 --> 00:19:08,059
they said, initially, there was
an assumption that everybody who

404
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,236
was

405
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:14,227
doing React Native was coming
from React. And then, when they

406
00:19:14,227 --> 00:19:18,700
asked for feedback, they found
that actually there were a lot

407
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,057
of non-React developers that
were coming in. So there were

408
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:26,616
assumptions built into the
documentation about where

409
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:28,491
folks were at. And then they
took that feedback, and updated

410
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:30,336
things,

411
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,656
and- and made it approachable
for ... I would say, more of an

412
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:40,416
entry-level learner to navigate
through the documentation, which

413
00:19:40,507 --> 00:19:41,797
is always fascinating to me.

414
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,312
Andrew: Yeah, I'm- I'm no
superhero. So, like, I read that

415
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:49,700
-- those documentation. Like, I
read that still [chuckles] on

416
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,146
a regular basis.

417
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,936
But, you know, I'm not pouring
over it like I did in the

418
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:55,946
beginning. But I remember, I
would frequently have to pop

419
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,956
back over

420
00:19:57,957 --> 00:19:59,617
to, like, "Well, what's the
React documentation?" Because

421
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:01,277
that has,

422
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:04,000
like, context that I need. I've
found that definitely to be

423
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,053
true. But yeah, it was -- it's
interesting. I -- I'm coming

424
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:10,106
from,

425
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:16,376
like, when I was in school, they
taught us AngularJS. Whatever

426
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:18,431
the -- I think it's the
framework that people don't like

427
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:20,486
as much [Bekah and Dan chuckle].

428
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:25,287
The version of Angular. And it's
like -- it's framework

429
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:27,926
experience, that's what I had.
But otherwise, it was just

430
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:36,267
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and some
PHP. So, like, it really coming

431
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:39,700
into, like, choosing a
framework. It kinda was like,

432
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,300
"Well, I know

433
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,426
JavaScript, so I can- I can
kinda figure this out."

434
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:47,166
Dan: I love that mentality.
That, you know, just being --

435
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,048
just, like,

436
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,444
the- the confidence to, you
know, be able to- be able to

437
00:20:50,444 --> 00:20:51,839
know you can,

438
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,700
like, pick something else up,
you know? Even if it's gonna

439
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,869
take a minute. We were just
talking about that with Roger, I

440
00:20:57,869 --> 00:21:00,000
think, [chuckles] on the last-
on the last podcast recording.

441
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,300
We ...

442
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,000
yeah. We're talking about, like,
learning and- and- and how that

443
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,294
-- that's one of those things
once you, like, get some job

444
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:08,499
experience,

445
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,442
you know? And you realize, like,
everybody's kind of in the same

446
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:15,373
boat. And, like, new big things
are become a little less scary

447
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:18,492
because even if it's just a big
black box, you know, that you

448
00:21:18,492 --> 00:21:20,407
don't really know anything
about, not -- like, once you've,

449
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:22,322
figured

450
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,863
out your way around one- one
programming, you know, I know

451
00:21:25,863 --> 00:21:28,982
language, it paradigm, or
whatever. So many of the

452
00:21:28,982 --> 00:21:32,282
things transfer, some of the
concepts transfer, you

453
00:21:32,282 --> 00:21:34,300
know? Roger was saying --
they're like, "All you really

454
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:34,772
need to know

455
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:38,583
is, like, ifs and for loops, you
know, or whatever, and you can

456
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:42,303
pretty much get your way through
any language." Sounds like that.

457
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:43,533
Which I agree- which I agreed
with, you know? In- in

458
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:44,673
principle,

459
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:47,252
it's -- they're all- they're all
kinda doing a lot of the same

460
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:49,000
stuff. So, it's cool.

461
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:51,377
Bekah: I'm- I'm gonna shift the
conversation just a little bit,

462
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:52,742
because I know you said that
you've been a developer for

463
00:21:52,742 --> 00:21:54,107
about

464
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:56,507
three years. And that's where
I've been too. So, I know for

465
00:21:56,507 --> 00:21:58,907
me, COVID

466
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:02,238
impacted a l- a lot of my early
job experience. And I'm just

467
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,448
curious,

468
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,300
how, if that impacted you as
well. And I know, you know,

469
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,700
early-career developers trying
to find community and then

470
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,518
suddenly being

471
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:17,803
isolated creates extra
challenges on top of things.

472
00:22:18,265 --> 00:22:25,000
Andrew: Yeah. So my- my story
there is I- I had a job at a

473
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:36,414
local company. And ... I mean,
Wisconsin cost of living isn't

474
00:22:36,414 --> 00:22:39,174
very high. I mean, depending
where you live. Where I live,

475
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:43,884
it's not. Therefore, pay is not
very high. So I took a local

476
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:50,500
job. And, you know, compensation
was ... meh. And -- but I was

477
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,970
sticking around, and because it
was my first job at the time,

478
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,440
and

479
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:01,960
I just worked with that company
to get career growth, and- and

480
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,519
then the pandemic started. I was
at -- I've been doing it a year

481
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:07,078
and

482
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:10,124
a half, almost two years at that
point. No. I don't know what --

483
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:14,000
time math is hard for me.

484
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,200
Bekah: Yeah [chuckles].

485
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,000
Andrew: That's why there are
libraries for that.

486
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,470
[Bekah and Dan chuckle] But ...
I -- and, yeah. Then-

487
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,930
then the pandemic started, and
my company was immediately like,

488
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:30,000
"Everybody go home. We're going
virtual." And I- I- I left the

489
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
office that day [chuckles]

490
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,309
and I didn't look back. I didn't
-- I was- I was stoked to

491
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:41,444
come work from home. Because I
am -- I'm legally blind. So,

492
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:46,500
like, commuting, I just depend
on somebody else to get me to

493
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:54,500
work. That was inconvenient for
my fiance, inconvenient for

494
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,559
my wallet if I needed to, you
know, get, like, a ride share or

495
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,139
something. I mean, my work was
six miles away. I -- maybe

496
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,719
somebody

497
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:09,123
can bike that every day if --
I'm just not for it. I'm- I'm

498
00:24:09,123 --> 00:24:11,700
realizing I'm giving a really
[chuckles] long drawn out

499
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,452
answer to this. Okay.

500
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:13,038
Bekah: No, that was great.

501
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:16,547
Andrew: So, yeah. So then, it --
and- and in -- to that same

502
00:24:16,547 --> 00:24:19,441
point,

503
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:24,303
like, with my vision, it's- it's
way easier for me to get

504
00:24:24,303 --> 00:24:27,300
comfortable at home. Like, the
ergonomics of my setup, you

505
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:33,000
know? I have -- my monitors are
mounted. So, you know, I- I have

506
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,231
27 inch

507
00:24:34,232 --> 00:24:38,432
monitors. They're like a very
modest size, even maybe on

508
00:24:38,432 --> 00:24:43,488
the large side. And I get them
inches from my face. But because

509
00:24:43,488 --> 00:24:46,817
they're mounted, I can have my
keyboard, like, you know, way

510
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:48,572
farther back. So I get that
nice, you know, 90 degree in my

511
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:50,327
elbows,

512
00:24:50,327 --> 00:24:54,258
but I can still see. And like, I
just can't do that in an office.

513
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:57,990
I can't be comfortable. Yeah, so
it was, like, really good for

514
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,809
me. And -- but I- I quickly
noticed, like, especially when

515
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:03,628
you took

516
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:07,888
away, like, the being at work
water cooler type stuff, you

517
00:25:07,888 --> 00:25:11,068
know, spending time with
coworkers, it's like, I- I don't

518
00:25:11,068 --> 00:25:17,068
like this company that much and
I'm not -- I'm very alone. And

519
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:20,608
so, I needed a new job. I
started looking, and I was just

520
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:24,148
not -- like,

521
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,328
even with two years experience,
right? I was- I was taking

522
00:25:27,328 --> 00:25:29,665
interviews and they wanted
people with more experience

523
00:25:29,665 --> 00:25:32,002
than

524
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:36,564
me or ... yeah. I- I just wasn't
it. Whatever it was they were

525
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:40,763
looking for, I wasn't it. And I
thought, well, okay. So

526
00:25:40,763 --> 00:25:46,044
everybody tells me, I remember
in school and just throughout my

527
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,000
life, they're like, "Oh, it's
about who you know, not what

528
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,300
you know. And you should do
networking." And- and I thought,

529
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,700
"I am an introvert. So, no,
thank you. I don't want to do

530
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,094
that." And I was

531
00:25:59,094 --> 00:26:01,494
listening to a podcast — a- a
tech podcast. I can't remember

532
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:03,894
which

533
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:06,339
one now. But actually, you were
on it Bekah. And you had talked

534
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:08,784
about

535
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:12,594
Virtual Coffee and I was like,
"Okay, that sounds different.

536
00:26:12,594 --> 00:26:14,173
That sounds like, you know, it's
networking, right? But it's-

537
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,752
it's not

538
00:26:17,263 --> 00:26:20,443
traditionally what I think of.
And it's a community of people

539
00:26:20,443 --> 00:26:23,503
doing the same thing that I'm
doing, and I need that." And I

540
00:26:23,503 --> 00:26:26,563
am

541
00:26:26,564 --> 00:26:30,493
so glad I listened to whatever
that podcast was [laughs].

542
00:26:30,729 --> 00:26:33,429
Bekah: Yeah. Maybe the React
Native podcast.

543
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:35,648
Andrew: It's very possible.
Yeah. And- and it's just -- it's

544
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,583
struck

545
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:39,355
me, and I'm like, "Okay. I'm
gonna join this community." And

546
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:41,127
I did

547
00:26:41,128 --> 00:26:46,000
that, and ... yeah. Ever since,
like, I joined VC, I got this,

548
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,158
like, sense

549
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,959
of self-confidence that I really
needed, I think, for

550
00:26:52,048 --> 00:27:00,818
finding a job outside of where I
live and ... and- and a

551
00:27:00,818 --> 00:27:06,219
community of, like, other people
working to better themselves,

552
00:27:07,064 --> 00:27:09,700
technically or even
non-technically. It's the thing

553
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,094
I love

554
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:11,819
about this community, too, is --
it's not just about the work

555
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:13,544
that we

556
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:19,723
do. So that was -- Virtual
Coffee, it was the launch

557
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:23,228
platform that got me to the job
that I got. It actually, like,

558
00:27:23,228 --> 00:27:26,733
i-in

559
00:27:26,733 --> 00:27:31,304
actual tangible terms, I got my
job through a different avenue.

560
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:36,884
But I think, sort of the
confidence in myself that I

561
00:27:36,884 --> 00:27:46,374
gained the, "Oh, I- I had, like,
access to people who could

562
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:50,183
help me," you know? "How do I-
how do I present myself at

563
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:55,574
interviews? How do I get better
at that? How do I answer X

564
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:58,700
coding question?" And that all
led me to, I think, finding

565
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:03,500
success in finding a job and
finding an equitable job, right?

566
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,500
Like, so I was-

567
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:04,700
Bekah: Mm.

568
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,852
Andrew: -like, I -- like, I
opened with, you know? I was --

569
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,681
I had a hard- I had

570
00:28:10,682 --> 00:28:14,103
limited options, locally, you
know? Limited tech stacks,

571
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:19,682
limited pay, limited benefits,
and I was able to get a fair

572
00:28:19,682 --> 00:28:23,837
compensation by being able to
look elsewhere and being

573
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:26,508
confident enough to look
elsewhere, and say, "I am worth

574
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:27,228
this."

575
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:30,495
Bekah: Thanks so much for
sharing that. I ... really

576
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:32,355
appreciate it. And I

577
00:28:32,355 --> 00:28:33,945
appreciate everything that
you're doing at Virtual Coffee.

578
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:35,535
And so,

579
00:28:35,746 --> 00:28:39,645
you know, we're happy to have
you here no matter what, but

580
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:41,505
especially, you're one of our
monthly challenge team leads.

581
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:43,365
And

582
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:49,230
so, I- I feel like you're really
-- you've really invested in the

583
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,750
community and supporting other
people to find that- that

584
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,270
feeling

585
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,871
of connectedness and community
that seems pretty important to

586
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:00,810
your journey. Do you wanna talk
a little bit about what you do

587
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:03,871
as monthly challenge co-team
lead?

588
00:29:05,131 --> 00:29:07,802
Andrew: Yeah, for sure. For me-
for me doing that, that is ...

589
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:10,473
right,

590
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:14,045
that is my opportunity to give
back to Virtual Coffee. And in

591
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:17,734
terms of, I got so much out of
Virtual Coffee. And it feels

592
00:29:19,055 --> 00:29:22,414
like I can't give back to this
community what it gave to me.

593
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:27,341
And I think it's -- I feel -- I
just feel compelled to- to,

594
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:31,607
like,

595
00:29:31,607 --> 00:29:33,962
volunteer and- and help. Help
others get what I got. Because

596
00:29:33,962 --> 00:29:36,317
my life,

597
00:29:36,347 --> 00:29:39,167
like, from before Virtual
Coffee, from me sitting at my

598
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:41,987
desk at

599
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:46,652
that last job to where I am
today ... oh, my gosh. I- I- I

600
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:51,316
have

601
00:29:51,317 --> 00:29:54,120
grown so much and I'm so happy
with where I've ended up. In a

602
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,923
lot

603
00:29:56,923 --> 00:29:59,472
of, you know, there's a lot of
influences in how that happened,

604
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:03,073
but I recognize the part that-
that Virtual Coffee played in

605
00:30:03,073 --> 00:30:05,052
that. And so, me doing the
monthly challenges is giving

606
00:30:05,052 --> 00:30:07,031
back to

607
00:30:07,032 --> 00:30:09,672
that. And so, yeah. At -- for-
for Virtual Coffee, we'd, like

608
00:30:09,672 --> 00:30:12,312
-- I mean,

609
00:30:12,313 --> 00:30:15,700
obviously, you two know this
[chuckles]. But w-we -- so, we

610
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,992
do a monthly challenge

611
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:24,928
and that will consist of ... we
have 12-ish? Or I think a little

612
00:30:24,928 --> 00:30:28,300
bit more, like, maybe 13 topics
that we will cover throughout

613
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,518
the year, and assign them to a
month. And that's what we'll

614
00:30:32,518 --> 00:30:34,903
focus on. And folks in the
community are free to

615
00:30:34,903 --> 00:30:37,288
participate

616
00:30:37,288 --> 00:30:44,518
in those challenges as a way to,
you know, expand their own

617
00:30:44,548 --> 00:30:50,593
skill set or to -- as their own
opportunity for growth. So, for

618
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:54,312
this upcoming month, for April,
we are doing -- we are

619
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:58,031
focusing on

620
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:06,853
jobs — on the job search and job
preparation. And so, like, what-

621
00:31:07,603 --> 00:31:10,003
what I do for that and what that
will look like, I guess, is it

622
00:31:10,003 --> 00:31:12,403
-- each

623
00:31:12,432 --> 00:31:13,492
challenge looks a little bit
different, but there are some,

624
00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:14,552
like,

625
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:21,232
commonalities in -- so, we- we
like to try and engage with the

626
00:31:21,232 --> 00:31:26,333
community throughout the
challenge, and provide

627
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:33,503
resources, and, basically,
support for them to ... to- to

628
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:39,593
grow. And ...

629
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:48,403
so I- I coordinate and help,
like, get the documentation and

630
00:31:48,403 --> 00:31:51,148
stuff that we need to set up in
order to make that magic happen

631
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:53,893
[chuckles].

632
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:58,423
I, you know, I work with people
who want to be involved.

633
00:31:58,423 --> 00:32:01,992
Like, "Hey, do you wanna run,
like, meetings associated with

634
00:32:01,992 --> 00:32:04,500
this challenge? Or do you want
to try and hype people up about

635
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,000
this challenge? Or do you wanna
help me write documentation

636
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,662
about this

637
00:32:07,663 --> 00:32:10,903
challenge?" So I try and rally
around that kinda stuff.

638
00:32:12,748 --> 00:32:14,442
Yeah, I don't do that alone.
Yeah. As- as you alluded to,

639
00:32:14,442 --> 00:32:16,136
Bekah,

640
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:20,847
I do that with, like, my co-lead
on that is Aurelie. And that

641
00:32:20,847 --> 00:32:26,817
is so wonderful that we co-lead
that together because, you know,

642
00:32:26,817 --> 00:32:28,812
it's a volunteer position,
right? It's we do what we can to

643
00:32:28,812 --> 00:32:30,807
give

644
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:36,000
back, but we also do have jobs
and families. And so sometimes,

645
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,700
we can't do as much as we'd like
to, and it's nice to have

646
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,784
somebody else there to help
balance that.

647
00:32:42,784 --> 00:32:44,358
Bekah: I keep- I keep hitting
the mute and unmute button,

648
00:32:44,358 --> 00:32:45,932
like, multiple

649
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:47,966
times. I don't know what's going
on. [Chuckles] Extra clicky

650
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,999
today.

651
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,148
Sorry. Yes! That is a great
overview of what our monthly

652
00:32:53,148 --> 00:32:55,412
challenges

653
00:32:55,413 --> 00:32:59,614
are. And they've been a lot of
fun, I think, working through

654
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:03,473
them. And like you said, we've
had ... I think at least 13, and

655
00:33:03,473 --> 00:33:06,700
we're kind of iterating on that
the second year around, trying

656
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,193
to figure out how things work.
And one of the great things I

657
00:33:10,193 --> 00:33:14,034
love to see is how many people
are helping each other through

658
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:18,084
that process, you know? Or
continuing. We had month of

659
00:33:18,084 --> 00:33:20,700
pairing a couple of months ago,
and somebody messaged me

660
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,700
recently, and said,

661
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,134
"I- I really loved being able to
pair with other people and I

662
00:33:25,134 --> 00:33:29,213
wanna keep that going." And
those are the kind of stories

663
00:33:29,213 --> 00:33:32,395
that really ... I didn't -- make
my heart feel happy. I'm not

664
00:33:32,395 --> 00:33:35,577
sure [chuckles]

665
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:40,078
how else to put it. Because
there's this- this love of the

666
00:33:40,078 --> 00:33:44,098
community that develops through
these things. And, you know, for

667
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:45,958
us, we haven't made a
competition out of it. Although

668
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,818
we have -- we've

669
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:51,300
had leaderboards and stuff, but
it's not like, "Oh, it's a race

670
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,300
to the top of the leaderboard."
It's just cool to be able to see

671
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:00,118
what everybody's doing and how
they're doing it. And I'm- I'm

672
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:03,568
really excited as we're going
into this second year of monthly

673
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:07,378
challenges, with this team of
people, to see all of the

674
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,588
connections that are continually
made and how we can keep

675
00:34:10,588 --> 00:34:11,699
supporting each other.

676
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:14,513
Andrew: It's really hard to say.
Like, all I want to say about

677
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:15,758
it I kept

678
00:34:16,028 --> 00:34:20,500
getting, like, lost in my own
thoughts. But, yes. So some

679
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,599
of the challenges that like --
so we did a- a writing challenge

680
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,698
in

681
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:34,300
November, where we- we supported
each other members in, like, in-

682
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,000
in writing blog posts or putting
out content, and right there

683
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,798
was, like,

684
00:34:38,798 --> 00:34:42,278
a leaderboard individually. You
could see who put in how many

685
00:34:42,278 --> 00:34:46,000
words. But that wasn't the
challenge. The challenge was to

686
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,148
-- like, the number of challenge
was we had a goal to hit. How

687
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:51,128
many -- c-can

688
00:34:51,128 --> 00:34:53,289
we hit this many words? I think,
was it a hundred thousand?

689
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:56,797
Bekah: I think it ended up being
over that, right? Did we hit the

690
00:34:56,797 --> 00:35:01,706
one 20, Dan? Do you remember?

691
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:03,700
Dan: Yeah ... [Bekah chuckles] I
just looked at it. I'm trying to

692
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,716
remember. I- I, like,

693
00:35:04,746 --> 00:35:06,500
literally looked at it yesterday
cuz I was- I was doing this. One

694
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,447
second. I can look it up really
quick. But --

695
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:09,472
Bekah: Yeah. Our challenge was
like 50,000 and we blew it out

696
00:35:09,472 --> 00:35:10,000
of the water.

697
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,700
Dan: Yeah, we blast- yeah, we
blast the best that in like a

698
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,000
week, I think.

699
00:35:13,317 --> 00:35:14,300
Andrew: Yeah. It was --

700
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:18,112
Dan: I see. Well, we got to 125
-- over 125,000. So --

701
00:35:18,112 --> 00:35:19,000
Bekah: Woop woop!

702
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:19,500
Dan: Yeah.

703
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,567
Andrew: Absolutely crazy.

704
00:35:20,692 --> 00:35:21,322
Dan: It was pretty dope.

705
00:35:21,947 --> 00:35:24,976
Andrew: And we had individual
contributors there, right? Who

706
00:35:24,976 --> 00:35:29,447
they wrote a lot of words and it
was amazing. And -- but we also

707
00:35:29,447 --> 00:35:31,967
succeeded together in crushing
that goal. And I think on

708
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:34,487
another

709
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:38,447
individual basis, I think people
succeeded in just writing

710
00:35:38,447 --> 00:35:39,800
something for the first time.

711
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,300
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

712
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Andrew: As- as someone who runs
the challenge, I don't -- I've-

713
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,351
I've tried to balance me
participating

714
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:50,276
and running it. And I just
can't- I can't do well at both.

715
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:57,000
But that's -- I do love
supporting that and so -- right.

716
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,342
Giving somebody an avenue to do
something for the first time, to

717
00:36:00,342 --> 00:36:01,691
write a blog post for the first
time. You see a lot of

718
00:36:01,691 --> 00:36:03,040
developers

719
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:05,216
do that. And if you want to do
it, it can be super

720
00:36:05,216 --> 00:36:07,391
intimidating.

721
00:36:09,311 --> 00:36:12,700
Being on a podcast can be super
intimidating [chuckles]. And so

722
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,721
when you see

723
00:36:13,722 --> 00:36:16,000
other people doing it and you
have that support, you're able

724
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,700
to- to

725
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,300
do that kind of stuff. And --
but I wanted to highlight too,

726
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:20,620
like, one

727
00:36:20,621 --> 00:36:23,681
of the challenges -- one of the
monthly challenges we did that I

728
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:29,800
really liked, I think it was --
we did it for December. And

729
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,500
I- I can't remember what we
called it. But it was about-

730
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,300
Bekah: Yes.

731
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,097
Andrew: -it was about

732
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:42,000
doing, like, your own ... what-
what's your passion outside of

733
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,165
your job?

734
00:36:43,197 --> 00:36:46,106
What's your passion outside of
the technical skill set you have

735
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,806
that brought you to Virtual
Coffee? Let's talk about that.

736
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:53,266
Let's celebrate that. There was
really cool stuff. In- in

737
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:57,536
music, we had people sharing
their own musical talents. I

738
00:36:57,536 --> 00:37:00,777
think that was Jessica, who
shared some cool videos in that.

739
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:05,800
We saw tons of yarn work, a lot
of knitters-

740
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,000
Bekah: Yes!

741
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,286
Andrew: -in VC.

742
00:37:07,606 --> 00:37:09,000
Bekah: And new knitters too!
Some people just-

743
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,300
Andrew: Yeah.

744
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,000
Bekah: -just took it up.

745
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,726
Andrew: Right.

746
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:12,257
Bekah: It was the creative
community challenge.

747
00:37:12,476 --> 00:37:16,197
Andrew: Yes. So, right, then. So
even in that, like, people were

748
00:37:16,197 --> 00:37:20,700
inspiring other people to pick
up new things. And I think I

749
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:27,251
love that about VC is getting to
share that kind of stuff too. I

750
00:37:27,251 --> 00:37:29,800
get to talk about programming
all day at work.

751
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,300
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

752
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,021
Andrew: Sometimes, I just

753
00:37:32,021 --> 00:37:36,521
wanna talk to people about the
things that I like to do. Like,

754
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:40,300
for creative community, I think
I built a 3D puzzle. And I had a

755
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,722
lot of fun, and it was very zen,
and not stressful at all.

756
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:46,300
Bekah: Yeah, I think that's so
important. And I'm glad that you

757
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,655
brought that one up. Because it-
it's something that more and

758
00:37:48,655 --> 00:37:51,010
more I'm

759
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,607
finding that I- I need to take a
break from coding things.

760
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:56,204
Because

761
00:37:56,204 --> 00:38:00,405
it's just constant coding or
community. And I love it. But I

762
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:04,005
do find that my brain is
sometimes just exhausted and

763
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:06,404
anxious because I'm overwhelmed
with all of these things that

764
00:38:08,804 --> 00:38:11,500
I'm doing and trying to learn.
And you're never gonna learn it

765
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,585
all [chuckles].

766
00:38:12,585 --> 00:38:17,300
You're never going to be an
expert at every single thing.

767
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,000
And I think that really, for me,
it's about, like, okay. I --

768
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,700
I've learned how to do these
things, but I need to make space

769
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,549
for- for other

770
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:32,010
things that don't feel
productive, that help me to

771
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,700
learn how to relax, which I- I
hear it's a thing that some

772
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,624
people do. [Laughs] I'm still
trying to figure that one out.

773
00:38:38,624 --> 00:38:39,000
Dan: What?

774
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,940
Bekah: [Laughs] And- and -- so I
think

775
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,420
it is initially Kirk's idea that
monthly challenges should have

776
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,579
four quarters and one quarter --
one month per quarter should be

777
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,604
devoted to non-tech things. And
we've even been, like, doing

778
00:38:52,604 --> 00:38:54,629
more

779
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:59,700
non-technical topics in Virtual
Coffee, just to say like, "Hey."

780
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,000
That is okay.

781
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,800
One- one time, we talked about,
like, cleaning products for

782
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,344
almost the entire time. I'm not
good at cleaning and I don't

783
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,888
like

784
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:11,010
it, but I think I'm fascinated
that there are all these tools

785
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,155
out there that I don't know
exist because I avoid knowing

786
00:39:13,155 --> 00:39:15,300
anything

787
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,700
about it [chuckles], but it was
really a great conversation.

788
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,409
Like, "Oh, okay. Now- now I know
this adult thing [laughs]."

789
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:28,889
Andrew: Yeah. We are the -- in
Virtual Coffee, and in any

790
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:31,274
community, you form, I think,
we're all- we're all diverse

791
00:39:31,274 --> 00:39:33,659
people

792
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:36,929
with diverse interests. In- in
the case of Virtual Coffee,

793
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:38,700
we're brought together by one
common interest.

794
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,500
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

795
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,539
Andrew: But we get to learn

796
00:39:42,989 --> 00:39:47,369
from each other about all this
other stuff. And I think that's

797
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:49,469
one of my favorite things about
VC.

798
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,069
Bekah: Same. Same. And I -- so
I've been doing a lot of

799
00:39:53,069 --> 00:39:55,124
research on

800
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:57,824
communities, and community
building, and there's different

801
00:39:57,824 --> 00:40:02,500
categories that communities are
often grouped into. And I kind

802
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,815
of love that. I don't feel like
we really fit into one category.

803
00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:12,405
Yes, we are here because we're
all interested in tech. But if

804
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:15,824
you look at the conversations
among people and the connections

805
00:40:15,824 --> 00:40:20,039
that are created, most of the
deep connections are not because

806
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:21,959
we're here for tech. It's
because we relate to each other

807
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:23,879
on a

808
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,680
different level. And that comes
with, you know, like bringing

809
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,480
who

810
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,110
we are and our interests outside
of tech into the conversation.

811
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:33,404
Because that- that, to some
extent, allows for more

812
00:40:33,404 --> 00:40:35,519
vulnerability and

813
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,029
openness to happen. And I- I
just love how great that is and

814
00:40:39,029 --> 00:40:42,539
how --

815
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:47,500
it's something that- that we
work hard to kinda preserve as

816
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,480
part of our community.

817
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:51,698
Andrew: Yeah, very much. I- I
keep thinking of, like, all

818
00:40:51,698 --> 00:40:54,038
these

819
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:59,081
instances of my interactions
with other community members. So

820
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:01,041
I keep name-dropping them. And
if that ends up being an issue,

821
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,890
we

822
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:05,000
can just throw like a clucking
chicken sound or something all

823
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,581
over these names
[unintelligible].

824
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Bekah: [Laughs] Name-drop them
all.

825
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Andrew: But Kirk and I will have
Zoom calls sometimes. Where,

826
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,291
like, sometimes we talk about
programming topics, but

827
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:19,571
oftentimes I find with him,
we'll just like wax

828
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:21,581
philosophical for an hour.

829
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,500
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

830
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,700
Andrew: And then, it was like,
"Where did the time go?" Like,

831
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,700
we came on this call to, you
know, just chit-chat. And that's

832
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,040
always sort

833
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:35,652
of where we end up. And -- but I
love that. Like, that's why I

834
00:41:35,652 --> 00:41:40,211
keep coming back, is to talk
about philosophy with Kirk.

835
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:43,131
Bekah: Kirk is great. I -- and
so, this -- well, once this

836
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:45,351
episode

837
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:48,802
airs, this will have been a- a
couple of weeks. But we -- this

838
00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:52,311
week we won Most Welcoming
Developer Community. I think

839
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:54,382
that's it. Is that what it is?
Cuz I keep saying that to

840
00:41:54,382 --> 00:41:59,700
people in -- on live [laughs]
things. Something- something

841
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,626
about welcoming. In my

842
00:42:00,626 --> 00:42:03,896
mind, we are definitely the most
welcoming developer community.

843
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:06,746
I think we won the award for
welcoming developer community.

844
00:42:06,746 --> 00:42:09,431
So that would make us the most,
right? By default? Because we

845
00:42:09,431 --> 00:42:12,116
won?

846
00:42:12,126 --> 00:42:14,197
Dan: No, I think the word- the
words called the most welcoming

847
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:15,007
developer community.

848
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:15,500
Bekah: Then I'm right. Okay.

849
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:15,700
Dan: Yeah.

850
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,547
Bekah: Excellent.

851
00:42:18,097 --> 00:42:18,516
Andrew: That --

852
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:19,500
Bekah: I dunno where it's going
with the awards. I was just

853
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,467
gonna drop that. And we won it
[laughs].

854
00:42:23,286 --> 00:42:26,136
Andrew: Well-earned.
Well-deserved. I -- when I first

855
00:42:26,136 --> 00:42:28,986
attended a VC

856
00:42:28,987 --> 00:42:35,347
meeting, I very much felt that
it ... like, it felt like I

857
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:42,626
belonged. And when I got into
the Slack and I started, like,

858
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,476
messaging people, like, there
were -- there was a subset of

859
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:49,300
people who've made me feel like
I belonged and those names will,

860
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,666
I think, will always stick out
to me. And, like, these were the

861
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:57,836
people who when I joined VC,
they were very active, they were

862
00:42:57,836 --> 00:43:03,086
very present, and they made me
feel a part of ... I think very

863
00:43:03,086 --> 00:43:05,186
much about our friend, Mike, was
one of those people.

864
00:43:05,536 --> 00:43:14,436
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. So much- so
much of that welcoming spirit.

865
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:18,700
And it- and it -- that is what
makes a community special, and

866
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,596
the ability to,

867
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:25,700
you know, have those ... quiet
conversations or, you know,

868
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,536
there -- even

868
00:43:26,536 --> 00:43:28,651
just -- there are tiny things
that I think are -- that are

869
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:30,766
hard to put

870
00:43:30,766 --> 00:43:35,356
into words that, you know,
somebody might remember. So,

871
00:43:35,597 --> 00:43:40,817
I got a package in the mail for
Christmas. No name on it, and it

872
00:43:40,817 --> 00:43:45,700
was a box of my favorite tea. I
don't know. I -- where did this

873
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,581
come from? So I ask

874
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:49,161
Kirk. And Kirk- Kirk knew who
sent it. It was somebody from

875
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:55,000
Virtual Coffee. And it -- just
tiny things like that. I- I mean

876
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,521
is -- well,

877
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:58,000
sending a package, I feel like
is a big thing because that

878
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,700
requires a lot of enger- energy.
But the idea that somebody

879
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,541
remembered what my

880
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:05,781
favorite tea was, was really
special. And there are like

881
00:44:05,781 --> 00:44:09,021
small

882
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:14,362
moments like that, that happen
all the time with people. Or

883
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:18,081
someone will remember something
that you've said a long time ago

884
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:20,362
and- and say something to you
about it. And it just makes you

885
00:44:20,362 --> 00:44:21,937
feel like, "Yes, these are-
these are my friends." And when

886
00:44:21,937 --> 00:44:23,512
people

887
00:44:23,512 --> 00:44:24,982
are like, 'My online friends,'
I'm like, "No, these are my

888
00:44:24,982 --> 00:44:26,452
friends,"

889
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:30,891
you know? And so I- I, for sure,
get what you're- you're

890
00:44:30,922 --> 00:44:31,731
saying there, Andrew.

891
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:37,300
Andrew: I think of, like, one of
my big passions is running. And

892
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,548
we have a channel in- in our
Slack, that's health and

893
00:44:38,548 --> 00:44:42,286
fitness. And so,

894
00:44:42,286 --> 00:44:46,956
I get to post about that running
there sometimes. And it's a

895
00:44:47,025 --> 00:44:49,590
opportunity for me to share
that. Like, the friends I have,

896
00:44:52,335 --> 00:44:57,500
who live around me, they- they
don't care, like, about my

897
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,000
running. I don't think they --
they're not like, "Oh, look

898
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,195
at this runner over here." Look,
they [chuckles]

899
00:45:03,195 --> 00:45:07,155
don't making fun of me for doing
it or something, but they just

900
00:45:07,155 --> 00:45:12,766
don't care. And that's fine. But
there are people at VC who I

901
00:45:12,766 --> 00:45:17,865
can share that with, and they
care. And it's like, it means so

902
00:45:17,865 --> 00:45:23,000
much to me like running does,
as- as a hobby and a passion,

903
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:30,690
and to have other people, like,
get invested to and care. It's

904
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:31,836
... priceless.

905
00:45:32,827 --> 00:45:35,556
Bekah: Yeah. We even, you know,
you ran a race recently, right?

906
00:45:35,556 --> 00:45:37,746
And I remember thinking like,
"Oh, I know that he's running a

907
00:45:37,746 --> 00:45:39,141
race. I need to go check, and
see if he posted about it, and

908
00:45:39,141 --> 00:45:40,536
ask him."

909
00:45:40,597 --> 00:45:44,496
And, like, that- that's it. I'm
not a huge runner. I've run a

910
00:45:44,496 --> 00:45:48,246
couple of 5Ks, but I'm invested
in knowing how you did, because

911
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:48,996
you're my friend. Like [laughs]
--

912
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:56,000
Andrew: Yeah. I- I see that,
like ... I see that with you,

913
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
with weightlifting that you do,
like, you'll -- I've seen, like,

914
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,690
videos of you

915
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:04,900
doing squats, and I'm like, "She
can definitely squat more than I

916
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,500
can." But I'm [Bekah laughs] --
because, you know, I'm not- I'm

917
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,050
not much of a

918
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,320
weightlifter, but it's the exact
same thing, right? Where I- I

919
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,000
look at that and I'm like, "I- I
am here for this. I'm here for

920
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,300
this success. Your success makes
it feel like my success. Let's

921
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,869
be successful together."

922
00:46:21,052 --> 00:46:22,177
Bekah: That- that's such a great
way to describe it. I feel like

923
00:46:22,177 --> 00:46:23,302
maybe

924
00:46:23,302 --> 00:46:25,700
that's the episode title. Let's
be successful together, right?

925
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,500
It's just all about lifting each
other up. And when times are

926
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:29,810
hard,

927
00:46:29,811 --> 00:46:33,351
especially in the last couple of
years, being able to do that is-

928
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:38,181
is ... I don't know. Just, like,
sometimes key to keeping that

929
00:46:38,181 --> 00:46:40,222
momentum. I'm going back to my
nickname.

930
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:46,184
Andrew: The- the -- one thing I
did- I did wanna talk

931
00:46:46,184 --> 00:46:52,000
about, kind of related to a lot
of the stuff we've said is,

932
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:01,000
like, one thing I've learned in
VC is I've learned -- I don't

933
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
think I've ever tried to put
this into words. So let me

934
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,500
give this-

935
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,000
Bekah: Yeah. It's fine.

936
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:08,599
Andrew: -a shot. Like, I ...

937
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:15,000
I'm learning how to be myself,
and be respectful to myself, and

938
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,939
allow

939
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:26,500
myself space to be a ce- a
certain way, I guess. I- I see

940
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,380
that, like, I get -- I

941
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:35,619
am my own worst critic. I am so
hard on myself, you know? I-

942
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,760
I make one mistake, and all of a
sudden I'm not good enough. And,

943
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,010
you know, a lot of -- some of
this plays into like imposter

944
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:47,775
syndrome type deal. Like, I --
my favorite analogy for this —

945
00:47:47,804 --> 00:47:49,799
and I do feel like this
sometimes — is that I am two

946
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:51,794
children in a

947
00:47:51,795 --> 00:47:55,005
trench coat who snuck into the
movies and I am gonna get caught

948
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:57,219
one of these days. I literally
was in a work meeting a couple

949
00:47:57,219 --> 00:48:03,500
of months ago. And I remember I
was talking, there was our CIO

950
00:48:03,764 --> 00:48:07,300
was in the meeting, and like,
some other PI up people. And

951
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,880
for some reason I had

952
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,489
the floor, and everybody was
listening to me, and I just like

953
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:14,800
froze, right in the middle of
talking. And I thought, "What am

954
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,000
I doing here?" Like, "I am too
much of a child to- to be doing

955
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,718
this." [Laughs] But

956
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:29,190
I think other people in VC who
experienced this and have,

957
00:48:30,704 --> 00:48:34,094
you know, some success some days
at overcoming it have taught me

958
00:48:34,094 --> 00:48:40,200
how to- to deal with that, and
how to be okay with that.

959
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,304
And one thing, I guess in- in
sort of this similar vein that I

960
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:52,605
carry with me a lot and I've
carried into work is, as we talk

961
00:48:52,605 --> 00:48:57,000
about in our VC meetings, we use
the raise hand-

962
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,300
Bekah: Function?

963
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:05,000
Andrew: -reaction on Zoom. Yeah.
To -- so that people can have

964
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,719
space to say

965
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:11,000
what they wanna say or share,
because it can be really hard

966
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,700
to- to just find space in a
conversation that is a reality

967
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,394
in, like, the real world. It can
be very difficult. People have

968
00:49:19,394 --> 00:49:21,914
different communication styles.
And some people, they're, like,

969
00:49:21,914 --> 00:49:24,500
"If you wanna say something,
well, you just interrupt me."

970
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:29,700
You know, that's not me. And-
and I -- I'm very much a

971
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,434
listener. So, if I'm

972
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,119
around a person who talks a lot,
they will -- I'll just sit

973
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,804
quietly.

974
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:40,835
And if they don't ever give me
space to say something, I

975
00:49:40,835 --> 00:49:44,000
don't say something. There is no
you can literally raise your

976
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,700
hand in real life. I'm not gonna
do that [chuckles]. But in Zoom,

977
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:46,804
there's

978
00:49:46,804 --> 00:49:50,465
that raise hand functionality
which allows me to find space.

979
00:49:50,945 --> 00:49:53,434
And I know I've talked a lot on
this podcast, so it sounds

980
00:49:53,434 --> 00:49:56,700
contradictory to me saying that
[chuckles]. I do that, but I

981
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,724
feel like this is

982
00:49:57,724 --> 00:50:03,454
somehow a unique case. But I
think, that is one of those

983
00:50:03,454 --> 00:50:06,500
little things. And- and maybe it
wasn't little when it was

984
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:06,724
thought

985
00:50:06,724 --> 00:50:08,134
of, and maybe it's not -- it
isn't little, I don't know. But

986
00:50:08,134 --> 00:50:09,544
it

987
00:50:09,545 --> 00:50:11,630
seems like a small decision that
was made, right? It's -- all you

988
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,715
do

989
00:50:13,715 --> 00:50:17,405
is you press the button, right?
But it is so big to me. And I

990
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:20,494
carried that to- to my work when
we have work meetings, and we've

991
00:50:20,494 --> 00:50:24,514
had like retros, and I'm like,
"Hey, there is not space for

992
00:50:24,514 --> 00:50:26,000
some of our quieter members of
our team-

993
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:26,500
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

994
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Andrew: -be themselves and to
share their

995
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,905
thoughts. And we need their
thoughts." So, you know, we use

996
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:39,405
that at work now too. And that's
a mind dump of like a sort of

997
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:42,494
being myself type thing that
I've learned from VC.

998
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,500
Bekah: Oh, I love that. I -- and
it is. That is those tiny things

999
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,124
that make a big difference,
especially if somebody is an

1000
00:50:49,124 --> 00:50:51,629
introvert, or is

1001
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:56,280
neurodiverse, or it's just not
really sure of what to expect

1002
00:50:56,369 --> 00:51:02,670
within the- the way that things
are happening. And so, having

1003
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:07,074
those things -- I know that at
work we use Google Meet, and

1004
00:51:07,074 --> 00:51:09,700
there's not a hand raise
function [chuckles]. And- and I

1005
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,784
realized how much

1006
00:51:11,784 --> 00:51:16,854
I love the hand raise function
now that we've been using it.

1007
00:51:16,854 --> 00:51:23,744
So -- actually, it was Infinite
Red, I think, that introduced us

1008
00:51:23,744 --> 00:51:27,704
to the hand raise function.
Because one of their founders

1009
00:51:27,704 --> 00:51:31,905
wrote a blog post about it. But
i-it's finding those things like

1010
00:51:31,934 --> 00:51:34,965
that, and then bringing them to
the community and integrating

1011
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:38,000
them in to make everyone feel
welcome, that- that does

1012
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,033
[chuckles] allow for

1013
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:45,835
everyone to feel welcome. Well,
Andrew, I appreciate you being

1014
00:51:45,835 --> 00:51:49,135
here with us today. We're just
about out of time. Are there any

1015
00:51:49,135 --> 00:51:53,994
last things that you'd like to
share with our audience or

1016
00:51:54,175 --> 00:51:55,795
... any words of wisdom?

1017
00:51:56,784 --> 00:52:03,652
Andrew: I think I've said a lot.
But I guess the- the- the

1018
00:52:03,652 --> 00:52:07,672
closing thought to tie all the
stuff I've said together is I

1019
00:52:07,672 --> 00:52:14,032
just wanna emphasize how much
this community is

1020
00:52:14,032 --> 00:52:17,813
valuable. And I, you know, to
those listening, you know, if

1021
00:52:17,813 --> 00:52:20,710
you're members of VC or
potential members of VC, you

1022
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,607
know, there is

1023
00:52:23,637 --> 00:52:26,277
more here than an opportunity
out of job, or an

1024
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:28,917
opportunity

1025
00:52:29,757 --> 00:52:33,958
at growing your technical
skills. Those things are here,

1026
00:52:34,588 --> 00:52:37,677
but there's an opportunity to be
yourself. There's an opportunity

1027
00:52:37,677 --> 00:52:44,518
to be around people who are like
you. And I think just don't be

1028
00:52:44,518 --> 00:52:49,047
afraid to- to join in all the
parts that our community has to

1029
00:52:49,047 --> 00:52:54,643
offer and- and, you know, share
yourself if you get

1030
00:52:54,643 --> 00:52:56,773
comfortable with that. It's
worth it.

1031
00:52:57,963 --> 00:53:01,443
Dan: I think that's awesome.
Thank you, Andrew, so much for

1032
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:02,702
coming on. I really appreciate
it.

1033
00:53:03,762 --> 00:53:04,902
Andrew: Thank you for having me.

1034
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Bekah: Bye.
