00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:14,007
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

3
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:16,746
that

4
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:20,407
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:21,696
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:22,985
their

7
00:00:22,986 --> 00:00:25,417
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:25,417 --> 00:00:26,886
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

9
00:00:26,886 --> 00:00:28,355
it with

10
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:30,847
you. Here with me today is my
cohost, Dan.

11
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:35,421
Dan Ott: Hello, Bekah. Today, we
are talking with Andrew Bush.

12
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:38,121
Andrew is a mobile engineer
specializing in React Native.

13
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,821
And so, if

14
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:44,301
you've been to virtualcoffee.io
recently and checked out

15
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:45,626
our members page, you might have
noticed, we now have -- we have

16
00:00:45,626 --> 00:00:46,951
all

17
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:51,301
of our members there. And now we
have a little tags that say what

18
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:53,000
roles that they have if- if
people are, you know,

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,091
volunteering, helping

19
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:57,432
out in Virtual Coffee. And so,
Andrew is one of the people that

20
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,991
has been helping out with us for
a while. He's been doing --

21
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,550
he's

22
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:02,951
been helping lead the Monthly
Challenge team for the

23
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:05,351
past ...

24
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:07,700
I don't know. How long has he
been? [Chuckles] I'm- I'm not

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,231
sure. I can't

25
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:09,822
remember off the top of my head
how long, But it feels like a

26
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:10,121
while.

27
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:11,171
Bekah: [Laughs] Well, it is.
It is been a while. Yeah.

28
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:12,701
Dan: It feels -- yeah. It feels
like to me, it's been while.

29
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:12,861
And- and --

29
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:14,331
Bekah: Since last year, for sure.

30
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:18,087
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. And so, monthly
challenges, you can read more

31
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:20,546
about on our site as well.
But we do a different challenge

32
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:22,811
every month. And- and, yeah.
So Andrew has been helping lead

33
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:25,076
that

34
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:29,300
group along with Aurelie and --
who was on the podcast-

35
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:29,500
Bekah: Yes.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,406
Dan: -season ... I

35
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:31,700
don't remember which season-

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Bekah: All that season throw
together [??][chuckles]. 

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,647
Dan: -she was on. Yeah, yeah.
She was on- [laughs] she was

36
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:37,887
on a while ago too. So, yeah. We
talked about that for a while.

37
00:01:37,887 --> 00:01:42,656
And Andrew, also, he kind of
talked about, you know, what it's

38
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,266
been like leading the- leading
the group and helping, you

39
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:48,177
know, facilitates challenges,
stuff like that. And we also

40
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:50,697
talked a while about, you know,
what it's like to be a mobile

41
00:01:50,697 --> 00:01:54,266
developer, some of his
experiences with React Native

42
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:56,846
and, of course, his journey
through his career.

43
00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:59,326
Bekah: Yeah. It was great
talking about that. And I li-

44
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:00,750
really love

45
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:02,221
that the tags recognize our
members and what they're doing.

46
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:03,661
I

47
00:02:03,662 --> 00:02:05,221
mean, not just because we wanna
recognize our members, but

48
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:06,780
also

49
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:08,596
it helps other people to see
who's doing what and how they

50
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,411
can

51
00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:13,991
get involved in Virtual Coffee.
And we actually have a new get

52
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:16,646
involved section on the site. So
if anybody is out there and

53
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:19,301
wants

54
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:23,171
to add a tag to their name, can
fill out one of those forms and

55
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:24,701
we can [laughs] --

56
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,287
Dan: And they can get involved
[laughs].

57
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:27,896
Bekah: Yep [laughs]. That was
good.

58
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:31,831
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. So if
you're listening and you wanna

59
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:32,836
check

60
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:34,336
that out, it's in the
resources section,

61
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:38,947
virtualcoffee.io/resources. And
then, I dunno. Click through in

62
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:42,336
there. It's in there somewhere.
So, yeah. It was a good

63
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,766
episode overall and I know
you're going to enjoy it.

64
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:48,752
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast like we start every

65
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,211
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

66
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:53,086
we're from, what we do, and a
random check-in question. We

67
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:54,961
hope

68
00:02:54,961 --> 00:03:00,842
you enjoy this episode. Our
intro question is, if you could

69
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:06,723
live in

70
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:13,112
an animated movie, what would it
be? My name is Bekah. I am a

71
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:16,007
technical community builder from
a small town in Ohio, and I

72
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:18,902
would live

73
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:27,527
in ... I feel like it needs to
have some kind of magical aspect

74
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:30,707
to it, because that would be
more fun. I was going to say

75
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:33,857
"Beauty

76
00:03:33,858 --> 00:03:38,828
And The Beast" cuz that's my
favorite movie. I'll just stick

77
00:03:38,828 --> 00:03:39,307
with that.

78
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:46,043
Dan: Pre beast conversion or
post? Like, is he still The

79
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:50,723
Beast? Basically, I mean -- and
all the other, you know, fun --

80
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:52,902
Bekah: Yeah. Cuz there's no more
magic if he's not The Beast.

81
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:54,300
Dan: Right [chuckles]. Right,
right. That's my -- that was

82
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,622
my question.

82
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:55,633
Bekah: It's kinda boring.

83
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:57,562
Dan: But if he's at The Beast,
then, you know, you got a whole

84
00:03:57,562 --> 00:03:58,913
other problem to deal with.

85
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,853
Bekah: Yeah. I wonder if his fur
is soft.

86
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:04,362
Dan: You know, I actually just
watched it with the kids.

87
00:04:04,362 --> 00:04:06,132
They -- you

88
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:08,112
know, it was their first time,
like, a week or two ago. I don't

89
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:12,402
watch it for a long time. S-so,
like, all the furniture are his

90
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:15,000
servants or whatever, his
household staff. Well, what --

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,632
like, did

91
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,512
he not have furniture at all
before that? [Bekah laughs] Or

92
00:04:19,512 --> 00:04:22,392
did they all turn

93
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:23,877
into furniture and then they,
like, just threw out the

94
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:26,713
existing, non-alive furniture?

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Bekah: Well, I don't think
everybody is furniture. I think

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,362
it's kind of got that Encanto
vibe,

97
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:33,500
where there's like magic in the
house. So, like, the head of all

98
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,793
of the cups is Mrs.

98
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:39,023
Pots. But not every cup is a
household worker. They just have

99
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:40,252
the magic now.

100
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:42,981
Dan: Oh, wait. You're -- so
you're saying, like, alive cups,

101
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:44,886
but they weren't

102
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:46,475
actually people before. They
just like --

103
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,451
Bekah: Ye- right. Just like-

104
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:48,725
Dan: The magic is like turning
-- okay.

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Bekah: -Mrs. Pots, and Chip,
like, they were people. But

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,500
there are other cups that move
around and do things-

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:53,700
Dan: Uh-huh.

00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,331
Bekah: -but that's just the
magic that is commanding the-

108
00:04:56,485 --> 00:04:56,815
Dan: Got it. Got it.

109
00:04:58,071 --> 00:04:59,091
Bekah: -enchanting the house.

110
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:06,076
Dan: [Laughs] Okay. Alright. Hi,
I'm Dan. I do web development in

111
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,685
Cleveland, Ohio. And, I
think, the first thing that

112
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:09,265
popped in my

113
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:11,826
mind was "Moana". The, you
know, the life there seems

114
00:05:11,826 --> 00:05:14,386
pretty

115
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:17,596
simple, you know? On an island
plus canoeing is one of my

116
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:22,605
favorite things and, so, that'd
be cool. Maui seems like a

117
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:24,630
cool hang. So I'm- I'm going
with- I'm going with Moana as

118
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,655
my- as my

119
00:05:26,656 --> 00:05:27,826
animated universe to live in.

120
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:29,985
Bekah: Are you taking your rain
shell with you?

121
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:31,745
Dan: Uh, probably. I won't have
to use it very much. But, you

122
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:33,305
know, that --

123
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:34,385
I'm sure it rains there
sometimes. There's like a rainy

124
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:35,405
season,

125
00:05:35,406 --> 00:05:39,735
right? I would- I would think.
Thanks for- thanks for that [chuckles].

126
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:42,070
Bekah: Just making sure you had
it. I know it's important to

127
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,285
you.

128
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:45,607
Dan: It is.

128
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:50,226
Andrew Bush: And I'm Andrew. And
I'm a mobile developer in the React

129
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:57,247
Native space based out of
Wisconsin. I- I think I'd

130
00:05:57,247 --> 00:06:02,857
live in the valley in Encanto,
but I have a bit of a recency

131
00:06:02,857 --> 00:06:06,547
bias. I just, like, that's the
most recent animated film I've

132
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:13,132
seen. But I- I -- the -- in the intro
sequence, there's these -- so it's

133
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:16,672
in Columbia. And then the intro
sequence, there's these kids who,

134
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:17,856
like, are like running with
little cups of coffee, and

135
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:19,011
they're

136
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:22,401
shaking, and the coffee splashing
out of the cups. I'd be like one

137
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:23,872
of those little kids. That's my
vibe.

138
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:24,822
Dan: Nice.

138
00:06:24,822 --> 00:06:27,314
Bekah: Yeah. [Chuckles] that is
-- my- my kids love, or my

139
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:29,806
five-year-old

140
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:35,257
loves that part where she says --
Mirabel- Mirabel says, "That's

141
00:06:35,257 --> 00:06:38,347
why coffee is for grownups."
They just laugh, every single

142
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:41,437
time [Andrew chuckles].

143
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:44,766
So, welcome, Andrew. Thank you so
much for being here with us for

144
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:49,987
this episode of our podcast. And
we always like to get started

145
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:53,887
with the origin story of each of
our guests. So what brought you

146
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:58,416
here to the state of your Andrew
developer career?

147
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:01,466
Andrew: All right. I should've
expected a question like this. I

148
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:04,139
got to work on my elevator pitch
anyway. Yeah, it's sort of

149
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,812
a ...

150
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,062
I don't know if there is a
traditional path, but I would

151
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,262
say

152
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:15,791
mine is non-traditional. I --
the first time I ever wrote code

153
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:21,822
was HTML, not even like
full-blown HTML. Just tags to

154
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:29,591
make my- my MySpace page cooler.
And then, like, a long time later,

155
00:07:29,862 --> 00:07:34,802
I thought I'd go to school for
that. And, you know, that

156
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:40,172
didn't go super well- [laughs] super
well for me. I -- my major wasn't

157
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:45,182
partying, so they kicked me out.
And, you know, I did -- you

158
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:46,772
know, after sorta like, you
know, trying to figure out what

159
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:48,362
I

160
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:50,476
wanted to be when I grow up for
many years, I was like, you

161
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:52,590
know,

162
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:56,221
I actually really liked
programming and I really liked

163
00:07:56,221 --> 00:08:00,721
web development, specifically. So
I- I have sort of sorted things

164
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:04,442
out. And I, actually, I went
back to school again, got an

165
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,562
associates degree and- and thought,
"All right. I just need to get a

166
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:12,091
job. I need to get into the
space." And I- I took an

167
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,551
interview for, like, a ve- a
very generic. You're gonna write

168
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:17,011
code, but

169
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:20,851
they didn't tell me what. And I
ended up writing React Native

170
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:22,951
code. And I did not expect
to be in a mobile developer

171
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:25,051
space.

---

172
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:30,422
Yeah. I actually really enjoyed
it. And that's where I've stuck

173
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:34,056
since then. And that's gotten me
to here.

174
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:38,839
Bekah: Yeah. So this is always
been fascinating to me because I

175
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,623
don't know that many React
Native developers. So can you

176
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:42,407
talk a

177
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:44,343
little bit about how you ended
up there? Cause it's not, you

178
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:46,278
know,

179
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:49,609
at least, I don't know a ton of
people doing react, native

180
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:54,889
development. First of All wait,
maybe let's pause and what is

181
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:57,469
React Native development. And
then answer my other question.

182
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:01,822
Andrew: All right. Yeah. So
React Native is a,

183
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:04,779
cross-platform

184
00:09:05,471 --> 00:09:12,221
framework, for mobile apps.
They are into the web space now.

185
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:16,510
So you can write all in one,
stack and then deploy wherever.

186
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,215
But yeah, the original intention
is so that you can have. A

187
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:22,780
single

188
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,341
code base in single skillsets to
be able to write Android and iOS

189
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:30,461
applications because native
Android applications that are

190
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:32,620
going to be in Java or Kotlin
and native iOS, that's going to

191
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,779
be in

192
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,360
swift. So rather than having,
you know, especially in a

193
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,421
professional environment,
distinct teams, knowing distinct

194
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:43,841
stacks and trying to always keep
those things in sync react.

195
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:48,416
Native is one of the solutions
that was out there. When

196
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,410
I first started, we started
with, native scripts, which

197
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,404
is just

198
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:53,965
another one of the options out
there, and then ended up

199
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:55,525
pivoting

200
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:58,645
because of the community support
for React Native it's made by

201
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:01,120
Facebook. So there's just a lot
of support and funding behind

202
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,595
it.

203
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:09,505
But yeah, it's at its core.
It's JavaScript. But

204
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,166
professionally I've always used
TypeScript on top of it.

205
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:17,272
Dan: That's cool. And so does
that work out? From what I

206
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:21,052
understand, I've never really
worked in it from dabbling.

207
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:24,841
But from what I understand, you
have the ability to do some

208
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:29,851
native stuff, if you need to, or
whatever, in like real app, you

209
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:32,101
know, in non-classroom apps that
you'd like the kind of stuff

210
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:35,371
you're actually working on. Do
does the cross-platform thing,

211
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:37,636
like honestly, like work out
really well, as opposed

212
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:39,781
like,

213
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:42,812
or do you need to end up having
to do like little weird little

214
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:44,281
things for, for, you know, for
different platforms, from time

215
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:45,750
to

216
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,990
time.

217
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:49,764
Andrew: Yeah, well, it, in
my experience, which I

218
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:53,067
would,

219
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:55,829
you know, for context, I've,
I've been doing this for, I've

220
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:57,509
been

221
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:59,639
doing it professionally for
about three years. So in my

222
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,769
experience,

223
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:07,438
rarely do we actually need to
write native code. Occasionally

224
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,098
you'll run into like, We had
some weird issue with splash

225
00:11:10,098 --> 00:11:12,488
screens

226
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:16,239
at my previous job and the
solution wasn't native solution.

227
00:11:16,328 --> 00:11:20,019
But a lot of times you find, you
can just get a package, that'll

228
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:25,778
handle that for you. But
yeah, actually most things are

229
00:11:25,778 --> 00:11:31,989
pretty seamless. The, the, I
guess the overhead you get is

230
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:36,413
recognizing that sense. It
builds across multiple

231
00:11:36,413 --> 00:11:38,557
platforms. It's

232
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:42,369
not always gonna like, come when
it gets compiled, it's not going

233
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:47,408
to behave in exactly the same
way. Every time. There's always

234
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:51,249
like little corks and sometimes
it's specifically on device. So

235
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:56,979
we've got like, we, when, when
you write it, you frequently,

236
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:58,869
when you're devving, you're like
using a simulator or an

237
00:11:58,869 --> 00:12:00,759
emulator.

238
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,080
And, but then like before you
roll out to production, As our

239
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,952
QA

240
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:10,403
is telling me when I'm doing dev
work to, I need to test on

241
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:13,854
physical device because that
uncovers more issues that you

242
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:16,179
don't see. So that's like the
big thing with it, I guess, more

243
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:18,504
so

244
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,471
than, I dunno, I sort of lost
the plot there.

245
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:23,736
Dan: More so than, than
different platforms and stuff

246
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:25,101
is, is really

247
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:26,766
just a, if I can understand what
you're saying, more, more of

248
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:28,431
the.

249
00:12:29,402 --> 00:12:32,312
The fact that you're working
specifically for a, you know,

250
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:34,741
you're building an app for it
device that somebody holds in

251
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:38,221
their hand. Right. And so as
opposed to something on a screen

252
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:40,261
with mouse or another pointer
device,

253
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:40,932
Andrew: right.

254
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:42,436
Dan: so yeah, that seems like
probably probably good advice

255
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:43,531
and

256
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:44,462
probably easy to forget when
you're, when you're in the

257
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:45,392
weeds,

258
00:12:45,392 --> 00:12:46,914
you know, Kind of been
developing for a long time on a,

259
00:12:46,914 --> 00:12:48,436
on a thing.

260
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:51,197
And just looking at your
simulator, on your computer.

261
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:54,976
I certainly like even on
websites have that same thing.

262
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:58,216
Right, right. I forget, I
look at it, you know, I see what

263
00:12:58,216 --> 00:13:01,096
it looks like on the iPhone, you
know, a simulator or the, that,

264
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:03,826
that Indev tools even, you know,
which is even another further

265
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,851
step removed from the actual
thing. Right. But it's

266
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,876
always

267
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:10,846
good to take a pass, you know,
see what it feels like, swiping

268
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:13,667
things or just scrolling, like
out, it looks scrolling on the,

269
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:16,201
on your. You know, for an
iPhone, at least it has the,

270
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:18,196
what you

271
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,157
call the scroll that keeps going
when you, when you flick it.

272
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:24,062
I can't remember what it's
called, but there's, there's a

273
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:25,922
name for it, but like on an
iPhone, when you scroll, you

274
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:28,231
know, everyone used to it, you
scroll with your finger and you

275
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:31,532
kind of flick it and it keeps
going. Right. Which is what most

276
00:13:31,532 --> 00:13:35,761
people on, computers, you
know, are using, don't have

277
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:38,461
that, right. They're using a
touch pad or a scroll bar,

278
00:13:38,522 --> 00:13:41,522
whatever, and it stops. Right.
And that experience is a little

279
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:43,111
bit different. You're going to
see some, you're going to see

280
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:46,682
things, especially if you
have interaction going on,

281
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:50,476
You know, it scroll interaction,
things like that. It seems

282
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:52,427
like a pretty important step to
take. So

283
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:56,413
Andrew: that's an actually
really interesting, the. Is

284
00:13:56,413 --> 00:14:00,075
there

285
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:03,106
might be a specific name for it.
I'm not thinking of it either,

286
00:14:03,106 --> 00:14:04,636
but like, you know, continuous
scrolling or maybe something

287
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,166
like

288
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:10,697
that. But yeah, that is it's
interesting when developing and

289
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:14,761
it, there are certain things
that each platform will natively

290
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:18,825
do on

291
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:26,417
its own. And. In my experience,
I try and create apps that are

292
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:31,336
consistent. So an iOS user, I
want them to see exactly what an

293
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:35,677
Android user sees, but you also
have to be aware of, well, what

294
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:39,362
are platform specific things
that say an iPhone user is going

295
00:14:39,362 --> 00:14:43,037
to

296
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:45,294
expect when they're in their
apps? Right? Navigation is one.

297
00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:47,551
I

298
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:51,451
phones don't have hardware
buttons for back navigation.

299
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:54,182
That's like by default, they've
got, they usually have a little

300
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:56,956
back arrow in the corner.
But yeah, until that scrolling,

301
00:14:56,956 --> 00:14:59,730
um,

302
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:05,312
it's interesting on those types
of scrollable things in apps,

303
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:07,621
there's a really slick
animation. I think that just

304
00:15:07,621 --> 00:15:09,481
kinda is native

305
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:15,287
to iOS that when you get to. It
does that infinite scroll. And I

306
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:16,487
just think it looks really
smooth and you get to the bottom

307
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:17,687
of the

308
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:21,437
list and it kind of balances
there at the bottom. And I think

309
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:24,856
it looks really good and that
just doesn't happen natively on

310
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:27,736
Android. And it's like, Hmm.

311
00:15:29,236 --> 00:15:32,236
Dan: I looked it up at the
it's called momentum scrolling.

312
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:36,677
And, I think that includes
that scroll past that exact

313
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,626
behavior you're talking about.
But it, so it's because it

314
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:40,516
is

315
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:42,376
cool and I've, I've like looked
at it and tried to recreate it a

316
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:45,197
couple of times in, in
JavaScript, whatever, but it, it

317
00:15:45,197 --> 00:15:48,256
does have momentum just going,
it's a great name for it. Cause

318
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:51,466
it's like, it really does. You
flick it in and it starts fast

319
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:54,721
and goes in and slows down and
stuff like that. It's

320
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:58,951
momentum scrolling. That's
that's what it's called.

321
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:01,611
Bekah: This has been a really
long week. And in my mind, I was

322
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:05,991
like, I want that to be my
nickname. That doesn't make any

323
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:07,581
sense, but like,

324
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,871
Andrew: I'd say by itself,
momentum is a pretty cool

325
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:12,412
nickname.

326
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:14,042
Dan: Yeah.

327
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:17,032
Andrew: scrolling part is sort
of weird to assign to a human.

328
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,207
Bekah: Yeah, I'm not sure
where to go with that either.

329
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:23,147
Um,

330
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:25,666
so I want to, I have some
minimal experience with React

331
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,006
Native. And

332
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:31,486
so one of the questions people
ask me all the time is, well,

333
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:35,687
what's the difference? Like how
what's the learning curve. From

334
00:16:35,716 --> 00:16:40,517
React to React Native, which I
actually think that React Native

335
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:45,047
is easier to learn, but I say
that as somebody who learned

336
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,537
React first, I don't know if you
have any thoughts on that,

337
00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:50,716
Andrew. I just like, you know,
here's a view. This is, it's not

338
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:52,907
a diff it's a, it's a view that
makes sense.

339
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:55,316
Andrew: Yeah, I've gone the
other way. I wouldn't say I've

340
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:56,681
learned

341
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:02,022
React so to speak. I sort of
vicariously have by doing React

342
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,301
Native, but yeah, I went the
other way. I started with React

343
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:10,721
Native and I've done some
dabbling in react. I think.

344
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:14,721
Right. The, the distinct
differences I noticed one is

345
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:16,415
like

346
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,146
in the JSX. So where you're
using traditional HTML type

347
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:21,876
tags, you

348
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:24,636
just, you don't use those in
React Native. You use.

349
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:32,727
Traditional native tags. I
remember seeing like view a

350
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:38,606
scroll view, text input, like
very these very declarative

351
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:42,326
names. I did a little bit of
development in Xamarin in

352
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:44,846
college, and that was a mobile
framework, that uses like

353
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:47,366
XML

354
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,371
type markup and. It had very
similar naming structure. So

355
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:51,376
like

356
00:17:51,386 --> 00:17:54,537
that, that stuff was super
familiar to me, but yeah, I find

357
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:57,821
it like that's that kind of
stuff just makes sense.

358
00:17:57,821 --> 00:18:01,105
Yeah, I

359
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:10,136
think really the other sort of,
it's more of a, like a mental

360
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:12,461
contextual. Between the two,
like knowing that you're working

361
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:14,786
on a

362
00:18:14,787 --> 00:18:18,356
mobile device, that it receives
taps, it doesn't receive clicks.

363
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:22,106
It receives like swipes and, you
know, it's, you gotta just be

364
00:18:22,106 --> 00:18:26,247
aware of the user experience is
very different. I think of

365
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:33,596
like our, another member of VC,
Louis, he coincidentally

366
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:40,991
joined my team. And at, at
work. He had never done React

367
00:18:40,991 --> 00:18:45,281
negative and he ramped up so
fast. He had React to experience

368
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:50,741
and he was instantly making
contributions. So I think,

369
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:54,402
yeah. Want one skillset can
really help you with the.

370
00:18:56,942 --> 00:19:02,162
Bekah: Yeah, I for sure. And
it's interesting because I heard

371
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:05,551
somebody talking about React
Native documentation once where

372
00:19:05,882 --> 00:19:08,059
they. Said initially there was
an assumption that everybody who

373
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,236
was

374
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:14,227
doing React Native was coming
from react. And then when they

375
00:19:14,227 --> 00:19:16,897
asked for feedback, they found
that actually there were a lot

376
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:19,567
of

377
00:19:19,596 --> 00:19:22,057
non-reactive developers that
were coming in. So there were

378
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:26,616
assumptions built into the
documentation, about where

379
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:28,491
folks were at. And then they
took that feedback and updated

380
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:30,336
things

381
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,656
and, and made it approachable
for, I would say more of an

382
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:40,416
entry level. Learner to navigate
through the documentation, which

383
00:19:40,507 --> 00:19:41,797
is always fascinating to me.

384
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:47,067
Andrew: Yeah, I'm, I'm no
superhero. So like, I read that

385
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:51,146
those documentation, like I read
that still on a regular basis,

386
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,936
but you know, I'm not pouring
over it like I did in the

387
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:57,957
beginning, but. I would
frequently have to pop back over

388
00:19:57,957 --> 00:20:01,277
to like, well, what's the React
documentation, because that has

389
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:02,981
like context that I need. I've
found that definitely to be

390
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:04,675
true.

391
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:10,106
But yeah, it was it's
interesting. I I'm coming from,

392
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:16,376
like, when I was in school, they
taught us angular, JS, whatever

393
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:20,487
the. I think it's the framework
that people don't like as much,

394
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:25,287
the version of angular and,
it's like is framework

395
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:27,926
experience. That's what I had.
But otherwise it was just

396
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:36,267
JavaScript, HTML, CSS and some
PHP. So like it really coming

397
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:38,397
into like choosing a framework,
it kind of was like, well, I

398
00:20:38,397 --> 00:20:40,527
know

399
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:44,426
Java script, so I can, I can
kind of figure this out.

400
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:49,049
Dan: I love that mentality that,
you know, Just being just like

401
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,839
the confidence to, you know, be
able to be able to know you can

402
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,000
like pick something else up, you
know, even if it's going to take

403
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,869
a minute, we were just
talking about that with Roger. I

404
00:20:57,869 --> 00:21:00,149
think I didn't realize, oh,
that's podcast recording. We,

405
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:02,429
um,

406
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,579
yeah, we're talking about like
learning and, and, and how that

407
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:07,535
that's one of those things once.
Like get some job experience,

408
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:08,981
you

409
00:21:08,982 --> 00:21:11,442
know, and you realize like
everybody's kind of in the same

410
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:13,407
boat, and like new big
things are become a little less

411
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:15,372
scary

412
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:18,492
because even if it's just a big
black box, you know, that you

413
00:21:18,492 --> 00:21:20,407
don't really know anything
about, not like once you've,

414
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:22,322
figured

415
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,863
out your way around one, one
programming, you know, I don't

416
00:21:25,863 --> 00:21:28,982
language it paradigm and
whatever. So many of the

417
00:21:28,982 --> 00:21:32,282
things. Transfer it, somebody
that concept's transfer, you

418
00:21:32,282 --> 00:21:33,527
know, Roger was saying, they're
like, oh, you really need to

419
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:34,772
know

420
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:38,583
is like, if, and for loops, you
know, or whatever, and you can

421
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:42,303
pretty much get your way through
any language. Sounds like that.

422
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:43,533
Which I agree, which I agreed
with, you know, in, in

423
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:44,673
principle,

424
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:47,252
it's, they're all, they're all
kind of doing a lot of the same

425
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:47,823
stuff. So.

426
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:50,147
Bekah: I'm going to shift
the conversation just a little

427
00:21:50,147 --> 00:21:51,377
bit,

428
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:52,742
because I know you said that
you've been a developer for

429
00:21:52,742 --> 00:21:54,107
about

430
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:56,507
three years and that's where
I've been to. So I know for me,

431
00:21:56,507 --> 00:21:58,907
COVID

432
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:05,448
impacted a lot of my early job
experience, and I'm just curious

433
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,682
how, if that impacted you as
well. And I know, you know,

434
00:22:07,682 --> 00:22:09,707
early

435
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,613
career developers trying to find
community and then suddenly

436
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:13,518
being

437
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:17,803
isolated. Creates extra
challenges on top of things.

438
00:22:18,265 --> 00:22:26,335
Andrew: Yeah. So my. Story there
is I, I had a job at a local

439
00:22:26,335 --> 00:22:36,414
company, and I mean,
Wisconsin cost of living. Isn't

440
00:22:36,414 --> 00:22:39,174
very high. I mean, depending
where you live, where I live,

441
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:43,884
it's not, therefore pay is
not very high. So I took a local

442
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:50,500
job and, you know,
compensation. And, but I was

443
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,970
sticking around and because it
was my first job at the time,

444
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,440
and

445
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:01,960
I just worked with that company
to get career growth. And, and

446
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,519
then the pandemic started, I was
at, I've been doing it a year

447
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:07,078
and

448
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:10,124
a half, almost two years at that
point. No. I don't know what

449
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:13,169
time

450
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:19,109
math is hard for me. there are
libraries for that. I, and

451
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,930
then the pandemic started in my
company was immediately like,

452
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:28,169
everybody go home. We're going
virtual. And I, I left the

453
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:30,989
office

454
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:35,309
that day and didn't look back. I
didn't, I was, I was stoked to

455
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:41,444
come work from home. Because I
am, I'm legally blind. So

456
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:46,904
like commuting, I just depend on
somebody else to get me to work.

457
00:23:47,144 --> 00:23:51,119
That was, inconvenient for
my fiance. Inconvenient for

458
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,094
my

459
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:58,559
wallet. If I needed to. You
know, get like a ride share or

460
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,720
something. I mean, my work was
six miles away. Maybe somebody

461
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:09,123
can bike that every day if I'm
just not for it. I'm

462
00:24:09,123 --> 00:24:12,452
realizing I'm giving a really
long drawn out answer to

463
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:13,038
Bekah: was

464
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:19,442
Andrew: So, yeah, so then it,
and, to that same point,

465
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:24,303
like, with my vision, it's,
it's way easier for me to get

466
00:24:24,303 --> 00:24:25,968
comfortable at home. Like the
ergonomics of my setup, you

467
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:27,633
know,

468
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:34,232
I have, my monitors are mounted,
so, you know, I, I have 27 inch

469
00:24:34,232 --> 00:24:38,432
monitors. They're like a very
modest size, even maybe on

470
00:24:38,432 --> 00:24:43,488
the large side and I get that.
Inches from my face, but because

471
00:24:43,488 --> 00:24:46,817
they're mounted, I can have my
keyboard, like, you know, way

472
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:48,572
farther back. So I get that
nice, you know, 90 degree in my

473
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:50,327
elbows,

474
00:24:50,327 --> 00:24:54,258
but I can still see. And like, I
just can't do that in an office.

475
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:56,124
I can't be comfortable.
Yeah, so it was like really good

476
00:24:56,124 --> 00:24:57,990
for

477
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:03,628
me. And, but I quickly noticed
like, Especially when you took

478
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:07,888
away, like the being at work,
water cooler type stuff, you

479
00:25:07,888 --> 00:25:11,068
know, spending time with
coworkers, it's like, I, I don't

480
00:25:11,068 --> 00:25:17,068
like this company that much and
I'm not, I'm very alone. And

481
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:24,148
so I needed a new job. I started
looking and I was just not like,

482
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,328
even with two years experience,
right. I was, I was taking

483
00:25:27,328 --> 00:25:29,665
interviews and they wanted
people. With more experience

484
00:25:29,665 --> 00:25:32,002
than

485
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:36,564
me or, yeah, I just wasn't it,
whatever it was, they were

486
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:40,763
looking for. I wasn't it. And,
I thought, well, okay. So

487
00:25:40,763 --> 00:25:46,044
everybody tells me, I remember
in school and just throughout my

488
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,273
life, they're like, oh, it's
about who, you know, not what

489
00:25:47,273 --> 00:25:48,502
you

490
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:52,703
know, and you should do
networking. And, and I thought I

491
00:25:52,703 --> 00:25:59,094
am. An introvert. So, no, thank
you. I don't do that. And I was

492
00:25:59,094 --> 00:26:03,894
listening to a podcast, a tech
podcast. I can't remember which

493
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:06,339
one now, but actually you were
on it Bekah and you had talked

494
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:08,784
about

495
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:10,689
Virtual Coffee and I was like,
okay, that sounds different.

496
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:12,594
That

497
00:26:12,594 --> 00:26:15,753
sounds like, you know, it's
networking. Right. But it's.

498
00:26:17,263 --> 00:26:20,443
Traditionally what I think of,
and it's a community of people

499
00:26:20,443 --> 00:26:26,564
doing the same thing that I'm
doing, and I need that. And I am

500
00:26:26,564 --> 00:26:30,493
so glad I listened to whatever
that podcast was.

501
00:26:30,729 --> 00:26:33,429
Bekah: Maybe the React Native
podcast.

502
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:35,648
Andrew: It's very possible.
yeah, and, and it's, it's, it's

503
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,583
struck

504
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:41,128
me and I'm like, I'm going to
join this community. And I did

505
00:26:41,128 --> 00:26:44,143
that and yeah, ever since, like
I joined VC, I got this like

506
00:26:44,143 --> 00:26:47,158
sense

507
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,959
of, self-confidence that I
really needed. I think for

508
00:26:52,048 --> 00:27:00,818
finding a job outside of where I
live and, and, and a

509
00:27:00,818 --> 00:27:06,219
community of like other people
working to better themselves.

510
00:27:07,064 --> 00:27:08,579
Technically or even on
technically it's the thing I

511
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:10,094
love

512
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:11,819
about this community too, is
it's not just about the work

513
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:13,544
that we

514
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:19,723
do. So that was, Virtual
Coffee. It was the launch

515
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:26,733
platform that got me to the job
that I got it actually like in

516
00:27:26,733 --> 00:27:31,304
actual, tangible terms. I got my
job through a different avenue,

517
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:36,884
but I think sort of the
confidence in myself that I

518
00:27:36,884 --> 00:27:46,374
gained the, you know, I, I had
like access to people who could

519
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:50,183
help me, you know, how do I, how
do I present myself at

520
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:55,574
interviews? How do I get better
at that? How do I answer? X

521
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:57,643
coding question. And that all
led me to, I think, finding

522
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,682
success

523
00:27:59,683 --> 00:28:04,513
in finding a job and finding an
equitable job, right? Like, so I

524
00:28:05,023 --> 00:28:10,682
like, I, like I opened with, you
know, I was, I had a hard, I had

525
00:28:10,682 --> 00:28:14,103
limited options locally, you
know, limited tech stacks,

526
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:19,682
limited pay, limited benefits,
and I was able to get a fair

527
00:28:19,682 --> 00:28:23,837
compensation. By being able to
look elsewhere and being

528
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:26,508
confident enough to look
elsewhere and say, I am worth

529
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:27,228
this.

530
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:30,495
Bekah: Thanks so much for
sharing that I. Really

531
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:32,355
appreciate it. I

532
00:28:32,355 --> 00:28:33,945
appreciate everything that
you're doing at Virtual Coffee.

533
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:35,535
And so,

534
00:28:35,746 --> 00:28:39,645
you know, we're happy to have
you here no matter what, but

535
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:41,505
especially you're one of our
monthly challenge team leads.

536
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:43,365
And

537
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:49,230
so I feel like. You're really,
you've really invested in the

538
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:54,270
community and supporting other
people to find that that feeling

539
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,871
of connectedness and community,
that seems pretty important to

540
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:00,810
your journey. You want to talk a
little bit about what you do as,

541
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:03,871
monthly challenge co-team
lead.

542
00:29:05,131 --> 00:29:07,802
Andrew: Yeah, for sure. For me,
for me doing that, that is

543
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:10,473
right.

544
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:14,045
That is my opportunity to give
back to Virtual Coffee. And in

545
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:17,734
terms of, I got so much out of
Virtual Coffee and it feels like

546
00:29:19,055 --> 00:29:22,414
I can't give back to this
community, what it gave to me.

547
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:31,607
And I think it's, I feel, I just
feel compelled to, to like

548
00:29:31,607 --> 00:29:36,317
volunteer and help, help others
get what I got, because my life,

549
00:29:36,347 --> 00:29:41,988
like from before Virtual Coffee
from me sitting at my desk at

550
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:51,317
that last job to where I am
today. Oh my gosh. I, I, I have

551
00:29:51,317 --> 00:29:54,120
grown so much and I'm so. Happy
with where I've ended up in a

552
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,923
lot

553
00:29:56,923 --> 00:29:59,472
of, you know, there's a lot of
influences in how that happened,

554
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:03,073
but I recognize the part that,
that Virtual Coffee played in

555
00:30:03,073 --> 00:30:05,052
that. And so me doing the
monthly challenges is giving

556
00:30:05,052 --> 00:30:07,031
back to

557
00:30:07,032 --> 00:30:12,313
that. And so, yeah, at four for
Virtual Coffee, we like, I mean,

558
00:30:12,313 --> 00:30:16,992
obviously you two know this, but
we, so we do a monthly challenge

559
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:24,928
and that will consist of, we
have. 12 ish or I think a little

560
00:30:24,928 --> 00:30:26,698
bit more like maybe 13 topics
that we will cover throughout

561
00:30:26,698 --> 00:30:28,468
the

562
00:30:28,468 --> 00:30:32,518
year, and assign them to a
month. And that's what we'll

563
00:30:32,518 --> 00:30:34,903
focus on. And folks in the
community are free to

564
00:30:34,903 --> 00:30:37,288
participate

565
00:30:37,288 --> 00:30:44,518
in those challenges as a way to,
you know, expand their own,

566
00:30:44,548 --> 00:30:50,593
skillset or as their own
opportunity for growth. So. For

567
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:54,312
this upcoming month for April,
we are doing, we are

568
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:58,031
focusing on

569
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:06,853
jobs on the job search and job
preparation. And so like what,

570
00:31:07,603 --> 00:31:12,403
what I do for that and what that
will look like, I guess is each

571
00:31:12,432 --> 00:31:14,553
challenge looks a little bit
different, but there are some

572
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:21,232
commonalities in, so we, we like
to. Try and engage with the

573
00:31:21,232 --> 00:31:26,333
community throughout the
challenge and, provide

574
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:39,593
resources and basically support
for them to, to, to grow. And,

575
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:48,403
so I coordinate and help,
like get the documentation and

576
00:31:48,403 --> 00:31:53,893
stuff that we need set up in
order to make that magic happen.

577
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:58,423
I, you know, I work with
people who want to be involved

578
00:31:58,423 --> 00:32:01,992
like, Hey, do you want to run
like meetings associated with

579
00:32:01,992 --> 00:32:03,462
this challenge? Or do you want
to try and hype people up about

580
00:32:03,462 --> 00:32:04,932
this

581
00:32:04,932 --> 00:32:06,297
challenge? Or do you want to
help me write documentation

582
00:32:06,297 --> 00:32:07,662
about this

583
00:32:07,663 --> 00:32:10,903
challenge? So I try and rally
around that kind of stuff.

584
00:32:12,748 --> 00:32:14,442
Yeah, I don't do that alone.
Yeah. As, as you alluded to

585
00:32:14,442 --> 00:32:16,136
back,

586
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:20,847
I do that with, like my co
lead on that is orally and that

587
00:32:20,847 --> 00:32:26,817
is so wonderful that we co lead
that together because you know,

588
00:32:26,817 --> 00:32:28,812
it's a volunteer position,
right. It's we do what we can to

589
00:32:28,812 --> 00:32:30,807
give

590
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:33,552
back, but we also do have jobs
and families. And so sometimes

591
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:36,297
we

592
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:40,633
can. Do as much as we'd like to,
and it's nice to have somebody

593
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:42,373
else there to help balance that.

594
00:32:42,784 --> 00:32:45,933
Bekah: I keep hitting the mute
and unmute button, like multiple

595
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:48,243
times. I don't know what's going
on extra cookie today.

596
00:32:48,243 --> 00:32:50,553
sorry.

597
00:32:50,884 --> 00:32:53,148
Yes, that is a great
overview of what our monthly

598
00:32:53,148 --> 00:32:55,412
challenges

599
00:32:55,413 --> 00:32:59,614
are. And they've been a lot of
fun, I think, working through

600
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:03,473
them. And like you said, we've
had. I think at least 13, and

601
00:33:03,473 --> 00:33:07,134
we're kind of iterating on that
the second year around trying to

602
00:33:07,134 --> 00:33:10,193
figure out how things work. And,
one of the great things I

603
00:33:10,193 --> 00:33:14,034
love to see is how many people
are helping each other through

604
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:18,084
that process, you know, or
continuing. We had month of

605
00:33:18,084 --> 00:33:19,854
pairing a couple months ago, and
somebody messaged me recently

606
00:33:19,854 --> 00:33:21,624
and

607
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:25,134
said, I really loved being able
to pair with other people and I

608
00:33:25,134 --> 00:33:29,213
want to keep that going. And
those are the kind of stories

609
00:33:29,213 --> 00:33:32,395
that really. I didn't make
my heart feel happy. I'm not

610
00:33:32,395 --> 00:33:35,577
sure

611
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:40,078
how else to put it because
there's this, this love of the

612
00:33:40,078 --> 00:33:44,098
community that develops through
these things. And you know, for

613
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:45,958
us, we haven't made a
competition out of it. Although

614
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,818
we have we've

615
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:49,708
had leaderboards and stuff, but
It's not like, oh, it's a race

616
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,598
to

617
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:55,949
the top of the leaderboard. It's
just cool to be able to see what

618
00:33:55,949 --> 00:33:58,033
everybody's doing and how
they're doing it. And, I'm,

619
00:33:58,033 --> 00:34:00,117
I'm

620
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:03,568
really excited as we're going
into this second year of monthly

621
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:07,378
challenges with this team of
people to see all of the

622
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,588
connections that are continually
made and how we can keep

623
00:34:10,588 --> 00:34:11,699
supporting each other.

624
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:15,759
Andrew: It's hard to say, like
all I want to say about it. I

625
00:34:16,028 --> 00:34:18,458
getting like lost in my own
thoughts. But yes. So some

626
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,888
of

627
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:24,699
the challenges that like, so we
did a, writing challenge in

628
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:29,659
November where we, we support
it. Each other members in like

629
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:34,619
in

630
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:36,713
writing blog posts or putting
out content and right there once

631
00:34:36,713 --> 00:34:38,798
like

632
00:34:38,798 --> 00:34:42,278
a leaderboard individually, you
could see who put in how many

633
00:34:42,278 --> 00:34:46,778
words, but that wasn't the
challenge. The challenge was to

634
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,128
like the number challenge was we
had a goal to hit. How many can

635
00:34:51,128 --> 00:34:53,289
we hit this many words? I think
was it a hundred thousand?

636
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:56,797
Bekah: I think it ended up being
over that. Right. Did we hit the

637
00:34:56,797 --> 00:35:01,706
one 20 Dan? Do you remember?

638
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:03,616
Dan: Yeah, I just looked at it.
I'm trying to remember. I, I

639
00:35:03,616 --> 00:35:04,716
like

640
00:35:04,746 --> 00:35:06,967
literally looked at it yesterday
cause I was doing this. I can

641
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:07,447
look it up real

642
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:09,242
Bekah: Yeah, our challenge was
like 50,000 and we

643
00:35:09,472 --> 00:35:12,532
Dan: Yeah, we blast the best
that in like a week. I think

644
00:35:13,317 --> 00:35:13,617
Andrew: Yeah.

645
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:18,112
Dan: I see, well, we got to 125
over 125,000. So

646
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:20,567
Andrew: Yeah, absolutely

647
00:35:20,692 --> 00:35:21,322
Dan: it was pretty dope.

648
00:35:21,947 --> 00:35:24,976
Andrew: And we had individual
contributors there, right. Who

649
00:35:24,976 --> 00:35:29,447
they wrote a lot of words and as
amazing. And, but we also

650
00:35:29,447 --> 00:35:31,967
succeeded together in crushing
that goal. And I think on

651
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:34,487
another

652
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:38,447
individual basis, I think people
succeeded in just writing

653
00:35:38,447 --> 00:35:43,271
something for the first time.
As, as someone who runs the

654
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:45,311
challenge, I don't I've, I've
tried to balance me

655
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,351
participating

656
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:50,276
and running it. And I just
can't, I can't do well at both.

657
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:53,201
But

658
00:35:53,672 --> 00:35:57,641
that's, I do love supporting
that. And so right. Giving

659
00:35:57,641 --> 00:36:00,342
somebody an avenue to do
something for the first time to

660
00:36:00,342 --> 00:36:03,041
write a blog post for the first
time you see a lot of developers

661
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:05,216
do that, and if you want to do
it, it can be super

662
00:36:05,216 --> 00:36:07,391
intimidating.

663
00:36:09,311 --> 00:36:11,516
Being on a podcast can be super
intimidating. And so when you

664
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:13,721
see

665
00:36:13,722 --> 00:36:15,282
other people doing it and you
have that support, you're able

666
00:36:15,282 --> 00:36:16,842
to

667
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:18,911
do that kind of stuff. And, but
I wanted to highlight too, like

668
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:20,620
one

669
00:36:20,621 --> 00:36:23,681
of the challenges, one of the
monthly challenges we did that I

670
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:27,201
really liked. I think it
was, we did it for December and

671
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:30,721
I, I

672
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:32,914
can't remember what we called
it, but it was about. It was

673
00:36:32,914 --> 00:36:35,097
about

674
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:39,131
doing like, your own. What's
your passion outside of your

675
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:43,165
job?

676
00:36:43,197 --> 00:36:46,106
What's your passion outside of
the technical skillset you have

677
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,806
that brought you to Virtual
Coffee? Let's talk about that.

678
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:51,036
Let's celebrate that. There
was really cool stuff. In,

679
00:36:51,036 --> 00:36:53,266
in

680
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:57,536
music, we had people sharing
their own musical talents. I

681
00:36:57,536 --> 00:37:00,777
think that was Jessica who,
shared some cool videos in that

682
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:07,286
we saw tons of. Yarn work a
lot of knitters in VC.

683
00:37:07,606 --> 00:37:10,726
Bekah: in new knitters too. Some
people just took it up. It the

684
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:12,257
creative community challenge.

685
00:37:12,476 --> 00:37:16,197
Andrew: Yes. So right then. So
even in that, like people were

686
00:37:16,197 --> 00:37:18,776
inspiring other people to pick
up new things. And I think I

687
00:37:18,776 --> 00:37:21,355
love

688
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:27,251
that about VC is getting to
share. That kind of stuff too. I

689
00:37:27,251 --> 00:37:29,636
get to talk about programming
all day at work. Sometimes I

690
00:37:29,636 --> 00:37:32,021
just

691
00:37:32,021 --> 00:37:36,521
want to talk to people about the
things that I like to do, like

692
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:38,486
for creative community. I think
I built a 3d puzzle and I had a

693
00:37:38,486 --> 00:37:40,451
lot

694
00:37:40,452 --> 00:37:43,722
of fun and it was very Zen and
not stressful.

695
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:46,300
Bekah: Yeah, I think that's so
important. And I'm glad that you

696
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:51,010
brought that one up because it's
something that more and more I'm

697
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:56,204
finding that I need to do. A
break from coding things because

698
00:37:56,204 --> 00:38:00,405
it's just constant coding or
community. And I love it, but I

699
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:04,005
do find that my brain is
sometimes just exhausted and

700
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:06,404
anxious because I'm overwhelmed
with all of these things that

701
00:38:06,404 --> 00:38:08,803
I'm

702
00:38:08,804 --> 00:38:11,894
doing and trying to learn. And
you're never gonna learn it all.

703
00:38:12,585 --> 00:38:14,954
You're never going to, be an
expert at every single thing.

704
00:38:14,954 --> 00:38:17,323
And

705
00:38:17,324 --> 00:38:22,349
I think that really, for me,
it's. Like, okay. I I've learned

706
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:24,449
how to do these things, but I
need to make space for, for

707
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:26,549
other

708
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:29,280
things that don't feel
productive. That helped me

709
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,010
to

710
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,309
learn how to relax, which I, I,
here's a thing that some people

711
00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:38,624
do. I'm still trying to figure
that one out. And, and so I

712
00:38:38,624 --> 00:38:41,939
think

713
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,420
it is initially Kirk's idea that
monthly challenges should have

714
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,579
four quarters and one quarter,
one month per quarter should be

715
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,630
devoted to non-tech things. And
we've even been like doing more

716
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:59,909
non-technical topics in Virtual
Coffee, just to say like, It was

717
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:04,800
okay. When one time we talked
about like cleaning products for

718
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,344
almost the entire time, I'm not
good at cleaning and I don't

719
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,888
like

720
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:11,010
it, but I think I'm fascinated
that there are all these tools

721
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,155
out there that I don't know
exist because I avoid knowing

722
00:39:13,155 --> 00:39:15,300
anything

723
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,349
about it, but it was really a
great conversation like, oh,

724
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:22,409
okay. Now, now I know this adult
thing.

725
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:28,889
Andrew: Yeah, we are the IM
virtual. The, and in any

726
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:31,274
community you form, I think
we're all, we're all diverse

727
00:39:31,274 --> 00:39:33,659
people

728
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:36,929
with diverse interests. In the
case of Virtual Coffee, we're

729
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:39,734
brought together by one common
interest. But we get to

730
00:39:39,734 --> 00:39:42,539
learn

731
00:39:42,989 --> 00:39:47,369
from each other about all this
other stuff. And I think that's

732
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:49,469
one of my favorite things about
visa.

733
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:55,125
Bekah: Same same. And I, so I've
been doing a lot of research on

734
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:57,824
communities and community
building, and there's different

735
00:39:57,824 --> 00:40:00,284
categories that communities are
often grouped into. And I kind

736
00:40:00,284 --> 00:40:02,744
of

737
00:40:02,744 --> 00:40:07,815
love that. I don't feel like we
really fit into one category.

738
00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:12,405
Yes, we are here because we're
all interested in tech. But if

739
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:15,824
you look at the conversations
among people and the connections

740
00:40:15,824 --> 00:40:20,039
that are created, Most of the
deep connections are not because

741
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:23,880
we're here for tech it's because
we relate to each other on a

742
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,680
different level. And that comes
with, you know, like bringing

743
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,480
who

744
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,110
we are and our interests outside
of tech into the conversation,

745
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:33,404
because that, that to some
extent allows for more

746
00:40:33,404 --> 00:40:35,519
vulnerability and

747
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,029
openness to happen. And I, I
just love how great that is and

748
00:40:39,029 --> 00:40:42,539
how

749
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,509
it's something that, that we
work hard. Kind of preserve as

750
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,788
part of

751
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:48,480
our community.

752
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:54,039
Andrew: Yeah, very much. I, I
keep thinking of like all these

753
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:59,081
instances of. My interactions
with other community members. So

754
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:01,041
I keep name-dropping them. And
if that ends up being an issue,

755
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,890
we

756
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:05,561
can just throw like a clucking
chicken sound or something over

757
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:09,581
me the names, but Kirk and I
will have a zoom calls

758
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:13,601
sometimes. Like

759
00:41:13,661 --> 00:41:17,291
sometimes we talk about
programming topics, but

760
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:19,571
oftentimes I find with him,
we'll just like wax

761
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:21,581
philosophical for

762
00:41:21,581 --> 00:41:26,172
an hour. And then it was like,
where did the time go? Like we

763
00:41:26,172 --> 00:41:30,041
came on this call to, you know,
just chit chat and that's always

764
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:35,652
sort of where we end up, but I
love that. Like, that's why I

765
00:41:35,652 --> 00:41:40,211
keep coming back, is to talk
about philosophy with Kirk.

766
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:45,351
Bekah: Kirk is great. And so
this, well, once this episode

767
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:48,802
airs, this will have been a
couple of weeks, but we, this

768
00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:52,311
week we won Most Welcoming
Developer Community. I think

769
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:54,382
that's it. Is that what it is?
Cause I keep saying that to

770
00:41:54,382 --> 00:42:00,626
people on live. Something,
something about welcoming in my

771
00:42:00,626 --> 00:42:03,896
mind, we are definitely the most
welcoming developer community.

772
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:06,746
I think we won the award for
welcoming developer community.

773
00:42:06,746 --> 00:42:08,726
So

774
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:12,117
that would make us the most
right by default because

775
00:42:12,126 --> 00:42:14,197
Dan: No, I think there were the
words called the most welcoming

776
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:15,007
developer community.

777
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:16,547
Bekah: then I'm right. Okay.
Excellent.

778
00:42:18,097 --> 00:42:18,516
Andrew: That

779
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:19,967
Bekah: where it's going with the
accident. I was just going to

780
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:21,467
drop that. We want it.

781
00:42:23,286 --> 00:42:26,136
Andrew: well earned
well-deserved I, when I first

782
00:42:26,136 --> 00:42:28,986
attended a VC

783
00:42:28,987 --> 00:42:35,347
meeting, I very much felt that
it, like, it felt like I

784
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:42,626
belonged. And I got into the
slack and I started like

785
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,476
messaging people. Like there
were, there was a subset of

786
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:47,531
people who've made me feel like
I belonged and those names will,

787
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,586
I

788
00:42:49,586 --> 00:42:53,666
think will always stick out to
me. And like, these were the

789
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:57,836
people who, when I joined VC,
they were very active. They were

790
00:42:57,836 --> 00:43:03,086
very present and they made me
feel a part of, I think very

791
00:43:03,086 --> 00:43:05,186
much about our friend. Mike was
one of those.

792
00:43:05,536 --> 00:43:14,436
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. So much, so
much of that welcoming spirit.

793
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:17,631
And it is, that is what makes a
community special and the

794
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,596
ability

795
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:26,536
to, you know, have those. Quiet
conversations or, you know, even

796
00:43:26,536 --> 00:43:30,766
just, there are tiny things that
I think are that are hard to put

797
00:43:30,766 --> 00:43:35,356
into words that, you know,
somebody might remember. So,

798
00:43:35,597 --> 00:43:40,817
I got a package in the mail for
Christmas, no name on it, and it

799
00:43:40,817 --> 00:43:46,581
was a box of my favorite tea.
Where did this come on? So I ask

800
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:49,161
her and Kirk, Kirk knew who's
done it. It was somebody from

801
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:55,521
Virtual Coffee and it just tiny
things like, that. I mean, well,

802
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:56,946
sending a package, I feel like
is a big thing because that

803
00:43:56,946 --> 00:43:58,371
requires

804
00:43:58,371 --> 00:44:02,541
a lot of energy, but the idea
that somebody remembered what my

805
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:05,781
favorite tea was. Was really
special. And there are like

806
00:44:05,781 --> 00:44:09,021
small

807
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:14,362
moments like that, that happen
all the time with people or

808
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:18,081
someone will remember something
that you've said a long time ago

809
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:20,362
and, and say something to you
about it. And it just makes you

810
00:44:20,362 --> 00:44:23,512
feel like, yes, these are, these
are my friends. And when people

811
00:44:23,512 --> 00:44:26,452
are like my online friends, I'm
like, no, these are my friends,

812
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:30,891
you know? And so I, I for
sure get what you're, you're

813
00:44:30,922 --> 00:44:31,731
saying there, Andrew.

814
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:35,048
Andrew: I think of like, One of
my big passions is running and

815
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:37,305
we

816
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:39,796
have a channel in our slack
that's health and fitness. And

817
00:44:39,796 --> 00:44:42,286
so

818
00:44:42,286 --> 00:44:46,956
I get to post about that running
there sometimes. And it's a

819
00:44:47,025 --> 00:44:49,590
opportunity for me to share
that, like the friends I have

820
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:52,155
who live

821
00:44:52,335 --> 00:44:58,545
around me, they, they don't care
about my running. I don't think

822
00:44:58,545 --> 00:45:00,870
that they're not like. Oh, look
at this runner over here.

823
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:03,195
They're

824
00:45:03,195 --> 00:45:07,155
done. making fun of me for doing
it or something, but they just

825
00:45:07,155 --> 00:45:12,766
don't care and that's fine.
But there are people at VC who I

826
00:45:12,766 --> 00:45:17,865
can share that with and they
care. And it's like, it means so

827
00:45:17,865 --> 00:45:20,895
much to me, like running does
as, as a hobby and a passion and

828
00:45:20,895 --> 00:45:23,925
to

829
00:45:23,925 --> 00:45:30,690
have other people like. Get
invested to and care. It's

830
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:31,836
priceless.

831
00:45:32,827 --> 00:45:35,556
Bekah: Yeah, W even, you know,
you ran a race recently, right?

832
00:45:35,556 --> 00:45:37,746
And I, remember thinking like,
oh, I know that he's running a

833
00:45:37,746 --> 00:45:39,141
race. I need to go check and see
if he posted about it and ask

834
00:45:39,141 --> 00:45:40,536
him

835
00:45:40,597 --> 00:45:44,496
and like that that's it. I'm not
a huge runner. I've run a couple

836
00:45:44,496 --> 00:45:48,246
of five Ks, but I'm invested in
knowing how you did, because

837
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:48,996
you're my friend.

838
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:53,943
Andrew: Yeah, I, I see that
like, I see that with you

839
00:45:53,943 --> 00:45:56,928
with,

840
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:01,690
Weightlifting that you do, like
you'll, I've seen videos of you

841
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:04,900
doing squats and I'm like, she
can definitely squat more than I

842
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,050
can. But, because you know, I'm
not, I'm not much of a

843
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,320
weightlifter, but it's the exact
same thing, right? Where I, I

844
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,360
look at that and I'm like, I am
here for this. I am here for

845
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,400
this

846
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,789
success. Your success makes it
feel like my success let's be

847
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:19,869
successful together.

848
00:46:21,052 --> 00:46:22,177
Bekah: That's such a great way
to describe it. I feel like

849
00:46:22,177 --> 00:46:23,302
maybe

850
00:46:23,302 --> 00:46:24,802
that's the episode title let's
be successful together. Right?

851
00:46:24,802 --> 00:46:26,302
It's

852
00:46:26,302 --> 00:46:28,056
just all about lifting each
other up. And when times are

853
00:46:28,056 --> 00:46:29,810
hard,

854
00:46:29,811 --> 00:46:33,351
especially in the last couple of
years, being able to do that is,

855
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:38,181
is, I don't know, just like
sometimes key to keeping that

856
00:46:38,181 --> 00:46:40,222
momentum. I'm going back to my
nickname.

857
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:46,184
Andrew: th the, one thing I
did, I did want to. Talk

858
00:46:46,184 --> 00:46:49,759
about kind of related to a lot
of the stuff we've said is like,

859
00:46:49,759 --> 00:46:53,334
one

860
00:46:53,335 --> 00:46:57,478
thing I've learned in, VC is
I've learned, I don't think I've

861
00:46:57,478 --> 00:47:01,621
ever

862
00:47:01,621 --> 00:47:07,262
tried to put this into words. So
let me give this a shot. Like I.

863
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:12,769
I'm learning how to be myself
and be respectful to myself and

864
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:16,939
allow

865
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:23,660
myself space to be a certain
way. I guess I see that, like I

866
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:30,380
get, I

867
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:35,619
am my own worst critic. I am so
hard on myself. You know, I,

868
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,760
I make one mistake and all of a
sudden I'm not good enough. And

869
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,010
you know, a lot of, some of this
plays into like imposter

870
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:47,775
syndrome. Type deal. Like I, my
favorite, analogy for this,

871
00:47:47,804 --> 00:47:49,799
and I do feel like this
sometimes is that I am two

872
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:51,794
children in a

873
00:47:51,795 --> 00:47:53,400
trench coat who snuck into the
movies and I going to get

874
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,005
caught.

875
00:47:55,184 --> 00:47:57,219
One of these days. I literally
was in a work meeting a couple

876
00:47:57,219 --> 00:47:59,254
of

877
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:01,509
months ago. And I remember I was
talking, there was our CIO was

878
00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:03,763
in

879
00:48:03,764 --> 00:48:06,322
the meeting and like, PI up
people. And for some reason I

880
00:48:06,322 --> 00:48:08,880
had

881
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,489
the floor and everybody was
listening to me and I just like

882
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,319
froze right in the middle of
talking. And I thought, what am

883
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:15,149
I

884
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:18,434
doing here? Like, I am too much
of a child to be doing this,

885
00:48:18,434 --> 00:48:21,718
but,

886
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:29,190
I think other people in VC
who experienced this and have.

887
00:48:30,704 --> 00:48:34,094
You know, some success some days
at overcoming it have taught me

888
00:48:34,094 --> 00:48:39,059
how to, to deal with that and
how to be okay with that.

889
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:44,024
And one

890
00:48:44,025 --> 00:48:49,304
thing I guess, in, in sort of
this similar vein, that I

891
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:52,605
carry with me a lot and I've
carried into work is as we talk

892
00:48:52,605 --> 00:48:56,122
about, in our VC meetings,
we use the raise hand.

893
00:48:56,122 --> 00:48:59,639
little

894
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:03,179
reaction on zoom. Yeah, too. So
that people can have space to

895
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:06,719
say

896
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:08,954
what they want to say or share,
because it can be really hard

897
00:49:08,954 --> 00:49:11,189
to.

898
00:49:12,974 --> 00:49:14,489
To just find space in a
conversation that is a reality

899
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:16,004
in

900
00:49:16,005 --> 00:49:19,394
like the real world, it can be
very difficult. People have

901
00:49:19,394 --> 00:49:21,914
different communication styles
and some people they're like, if

902
00:49:21,914 --> 00:49:25,094
you want to say something, but
it just interrupt me. You know,

903
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:27,764
that's not me. And, and I
I'm very much a listener. So if

904
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,434
I'm

905
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:35,804
around a person who talks a lot,
they will, I'll just sit quiet.

906
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:40,835
And if they don't ever give
me space to say something, I

907
00:49:40,835 --> 00:49:42,380
don't say something. There is
no, you can literally raise

908
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,925
your

909
00:49:43,925 --> 00:49:46,804
hand in real life. I'm not going
to too fat, but in zoom there's

910
00:49:46,804 --> 00:49:50,465
that raise hand functionality,
which allows me to find space.

911
00:49:50,945 --> 00:49:53,434
And I know I've talked a lot on
those podcasts, so it sounds

912
00:49:53,434 --> 00:49:55,579
contradictory to me saying that
I do that, but I feel like this

913
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:57,724
is

914
00:49:57,724 --> 00:50:03,454
somehow a unique case, but I
think. That is one of those

915
00:50:03,454 --> 00:50:05,089
little things. And maybe it
wasn't little when it was

916
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:06,724
thought

917
00:50:06,724 --> 00:50:09,545
of, and maybe it's not isn't
little, I don't know. But it

918
00:50:09,545 --> 00:50:13,715
seems like a small decision that
was made, right? It's all you do

919
00:50:13,715 --> 00:50:17,405
is you press the button. Right.
But it is so big to me. And I

920
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:20,494
carried that to, to my work when
we have work meetings and we've

921
00:50:20,494 --> 00:50:24,514
had like retros and I'm like,
Hey, there is not space for some

922
00:50:24,514 --> 00:50:28,905
of our quieter members of our
team. Be themselves and to share

923
00:50:28,934 --> 00:50:31,905
their thoughts and we need their
thoughts. So, you know, we use

924
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:39,405
that at work now too. And that's
a mind dump of like a sort of

925
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:42,494
being myself type thing that
I've learned, from VCs.

926
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,209
Bekah: Oh, I love that. I, and
it is that is those tiny things

927
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,618
that

928
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:49,124
make a big difference,
especially if somebody is an

929
00:50:49,124 --> 00:50:51,629
introvert or is

930
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:56,280
neurodiverse, or it's just not
really sure of what to expect

931
00:50:56,369 --> 00:51:02,670
within, the way that things
are happening. And so having

932
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:07,074
those things, I know that. At
work we use, Google meet and

933
00:51:07,074 --> 00:51:09,429
there's not a hand raise
function. And I realized how

934
00:51:09,429 --> 00:51:11,784
much

935
00:51:11,784 --> 00:51:14,319
I love the hand raise function
now that we've been using it.

936
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,854
So,

937
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:23,744
actually. It was infinite
red. I think that introduced us

938
00:51:23,744 --> 00:51:27,704
to the hand raise function
because one of their founders

939
00:51:27,704 --> 00:51:31,905
wrote a blog post about it, but
it's finding those things like

940
00:51:31,934 --> 00:51:34,965
that and then bringing them to
the community and integrating

941
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:37,499
them in to make everyone feel
welcome. That that does allow

942
00:51:37,499 --> 00:51:40,033
for

943
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:45,835
everyone to feel welcome. Well,
Andrew, I appreciate you being

944
00:51:45,835 --> 00:51:49,135
here with us today. We're just
about out of time. Are there any

945
00:51:49,135 --> 00:51:53,994
last things that you'd like to
share with our audience or,

946
00:51:54,175 --> 00:51:55,795
any words of wisdom?

947
00:51:56,784 --> 00:52:03,652
Andrew: I think I've said a lot.
But I guess the, the, the

948
00:52:03,652 --> 00:52:07,672
closing thought to tie all the
stuff I've said together is I

949
00:52:07,672 --> 00:52:14,032
just want to emphasize how much,
this community, is

950
00:52:14,032 --> 00:52:17,813
valuable. And I, you know, to
those listening, you know, if

951
00:52:17,813 --> 00:52:20,710
you're members of VC or
potential members of VC, You

952
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,607
know, there is

953
00:52:23,637 --> 00:52:26,277
more here than an opportunity
out of job, or an

954
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:28,917
opportunity,

955
00:52:29,757 --> 00:52:33,958
at growing your technical
skills. Those things are here,

956
00:52:34,588 --> 00:52:37,677
but there's an opportunity to be
yourself. There's an opportunity

957
00:52:37,677 --> 00:52:44,518
to be around people who are like
you. And I think just don't be

958
00:52:44,518 --> 00:52:49,047
afraid to, to join in all the
parts that our community has to

959
00:52:49,047 --> 00:52:54,643
offer and, and, you know,
share yourself. If you get

960
00:52:54,643 --> 00:52:56,773
comfortable with that, it's
worth it.

961
00:52:57,963 --> 00:53:01,443
Dan: I think that's awesome.
Thank you Andrew so much for

962
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:02,702
coming on. I really appreciate
it.

963
00:53:03,762 --> 00:53:04,902
