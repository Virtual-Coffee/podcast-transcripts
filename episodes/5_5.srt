coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,956
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

9
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:26,579
it with

10
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,399
you. Here with me today is my
cohost, Dan.

11
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:33,225
Dan Ott: Hey, Bekah. Today we're
talking with Roger Gentry. Roger

12
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:35,655
has spent a lot of his career
managing security and compliance

13
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:38,445
for clients across the United
States. And this episode, you'll

14
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:40,844
hear from Roger about
perseverance, his drive to solve

15
00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:42,509
problems, and his process for
finding solutions. He shares

16
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,174
some

17
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:46,725
tips for working through
frustrations and how to ask for

18
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:47,115
help.

19
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:49,975
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast like we start every

20
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:52,975
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

21
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:54,850
we're from, what we do, and a
random check-in question. We

22
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,725
hope

23
00:00:56,725 --> 00:01:08,802
you enjoy this episode. Today's
random check-in question is, if

24
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:13,783
you could be an article of
clothing, what would it be? My

25
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:17,983
name is Bekah. I am a technical
community builder from a small

26
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:22,813
town in Ohio. And if I could be
any article clothing, it'd

27
00:01:22,813 --> 00:01:27,313
probably be a sweatshirt, like a
hoodie. Because I have a

28
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:30,822
collection of them since the
pandemic started. I just keep

29
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:35,112
buying them. I can't stop.
They're very comfortable and I

30
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:38,472
like them. So, I'll go with
hoodie.

31
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:42,327
Dan: Yeah. Hoodies are good.
Hi, I'm Dan. I am a web

32
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:44,367
developer

33
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:49,528
from Cleveland, Ohio. And, yeah,
if I could be an article of

34
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:52,047
clothing ... I- I mean, hoodie
was like, up there. I think- I

35
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:54,566
think

36
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:59,188
I'm gonna go with like a- a rain
shell. So, like a rain- yeah,

37
00:01:59,197 --> 00:02:02,000
raincoat. So I say shell, cuz
it's like -- that's- [chuckles]

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,672
that's what you call it when
it's camping, right? So shell is

39
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:04,647
something that can go --

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Bekah: Nobody calls it that.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,528
Dan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. People-
people who know, who know.

41
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,018
And- and if you don't know them,
that's fine too. But it's, like,

42
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:12,298
it's called a shell because
you can put it on top of, you

43
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,068
know, if you have a hoodie or
whatever, you can still wear it,

44
00:02:14,127 --> 00:02:16,018
you know, your raincoat. It
keeps you protected. But you can

45
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:18,087
wear it in summer and stuff too.
But raincoat --

46
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:20,043
Bekah: It goes over your
raincoat?

47
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,242
Dan: No, no, no. It's a
raincoat, but like, not like a

48
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,311
fancy

49
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:27,402
raincoat that looks nice. It's
like a raincoat that is, you

50
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:30,312
know, a utility. You call it a
shell because you can put it

51
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:33,703
over, you know, you can, like,
[laughs] bring the same raincoat

52
00:02:33,703 --> 00:02:35,700
camping in the summer, in the
winter, in whatever, you know?

53
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,103
So, in the

53
00:02:36,103 --> 00:02:38,000
winter, I just put it over top
of all my layers. And in the

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,103
summer, put over

55
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:42,823
top of the t-shirt or whatever.
That's why it called a shell.

56
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:46,513
Bekah: I would like it to look
like a turtle shell.

57
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:51,000
Dan: [Chuckles] Okay. Well, you
can have the turtle shell, rain-

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,798
rain shell, [laughs] and that'd
be fine too.

60
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,000
Roger Gentry: Hi, everyone. My
name's Roger, and I'm a full

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
stack developer in sunny
Southern California. And if I

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
was an article of clothing, I'd
have to be a zip-up hoodie.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,578
Specifically,

64
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:07,997
a zip-up hoodie. Because
everything else just sort of a

65
00:03:07,997 --> 00:03:11,300
you get caught in the- in the
web of the- the sweater. But the

66
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,987
zip-up, you

67
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:13,832
can just go quickly from hot to
cold. And, you know, I love

68
00:03:13,832 --> 00:03:15,677
that.

69
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:20,300
Bekah: Yeah. I- I like the
zip-up hoodie too. It just

70
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,650
depends on my

71
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:24,700
mood. But also, like, sometimes
it's hot and sometimes it's

72
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,322
cold. And it's much easier to
remove one that has a zipper.

73
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:30,300
Dan: Yeah. I mean, zip-up
hoodies are clearly better than

75
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,500
pullover, it seems [??].
There's- [chuckles] there's-

76
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:31,324
there's no contest.

76
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,900
Bekah: Not all the time. I mean,
zippers are cold too. So, if

77
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,700
it's cold outside, and they
touch your skin, then it's cold.

78
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,000
Roger, thanks for being here.
We're very glad to have you on

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,700
the podcast. And when we start
the podcast, everyone, we like

81
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,500
to get people's origin stories.
So, how -- what brought you to

82
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,073
where you are today in life?

83
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:58,842
Roger: You know, it's kind of
funny. I- I kind of remember the

84
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:02,443
first time that I saw somebody
building a website, and it was

85
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:07,527
some friends of mine in the
school library. And they just

86
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:12,508
-- we're having fun. And I
wanted to do that as well. So, I

87
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:17,307
kind of acquired a free computer
and just set that up in my

88
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:20,000
room. Like, you know, this is
... I can't even remember the

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,608
year. Early two thousands. So,
you know, it wasn't that ... I

90
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:28,747
advanced to have a laptop quite
yet for me. And once I kind of

91
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:33,278
figured out how I could build a
website with HTML, and CSS, and

92
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:39,500
Notepad on the Windows, I kind
of was hooked. And it just sort

94
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,017
of became almost like a hobby
that just kept me going all the

95
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:50,637
time. And I took that skill set
and immediately did the thing

96
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:53,968
that I've done, kind of forever
now, is turned it into a way to

97
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:59,098
make money, which I did by going
to just the businesses that were

98
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,700
in my town, and finding the one
that just had a terrible

99
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,500
website, and convincing them
that they needed a new one, and

100
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,500
I could be the person to build
it. Kind of -- as I went along

101
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,543
in school, and

102
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:12,242
eventually high school, I had an
opportunity to take kind of a- a

103
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:15,843
multimedia course, which taught
me a lot of like Photoshop,

104
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:21,423
Illustrator, just a lot of
photo editing and video editing

105
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:23,598
skills that I kind of combined
into this, you know, love of

106
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:25,773
code

107
00:05:25,773 --> 00:05:30,333
with the web design side of
things. And, you know, that kind

108
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:35,072
of propelled me forward and I've
always had a knack for fixing

109
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:40,242
things. So, I kind of landed in
this weird place of fixing a lot

110
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:44,622
more things than I was building.
But then, using the skill set

111
00:05:44,622 --> 00:05:49,033
of being, you know, a developer
at heart to build a solutions to

112
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:53,000
solve problems in ways that
people weren't thinking about.

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,733
And that

113
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,802
excited me more and more, and,
you know, I'm kind of a- a

114
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:57,871
person

115
00:05:57,872 --> 00:06:00,872
in necessity. If I- if I see
something that I- I really need,

116
00:06:00,872 --> 00:06:04,233
I'll figure out a way to get it.
And I wanted to build a SaaS

117
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:07,417
product for fun. I -- and then
kind of managed to make that

118
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:10,332
possible

119
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:14,892
with a- a company I was working
at, and we- we had a lot of fun

120
00:06:14,923 --> 00:06:18,132
putting it together. But then I
kind of found I had a lot more

121
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:21,252
fun building kind of the
prototype, and understanding the

122
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:23,533
code, and coming up with the
methodologies, and how we were

123
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:29,382
gonna do things. And looking
back, I kind of have always

124
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:30,897
been a, like, a web developer,
but it was at that point where I

125
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:32,412
was

126
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:36,552
putting together this weird
little cloud service that I

127
00:06:36,702 --> 00:06:41,322
really saw a need to become on
everything developer because,

128
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:45,343
you know, there was so much more
that was missing from what I

129
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:47,308
wanted to put together. And that
led me to just to kind of

130
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:49,273
absorb

131
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:52,603
into building iOS and Android
applications, and then, a web

132
00:06:52,603 --> 00:06:57,012
backend and, you know, combining
everything together and finding

133
00:06:57,012 --> 00:07:01,783
the glue that works the best.
Which, surprisingly, there's no

134
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:03,237
really good fit all solution
despite any of the marketing

135
00:07:03,237 --> 00:07:04,691
that

136
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,874
you'll see on anybody's
products. And getting

137
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:09,056
everything together,

138
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:12,807
and finally seeing, like, an API
that I wrote, and connect to the

139
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,922
apps that I helped build with
the website that I put together

140
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:17,037
for a

141
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,637
customer that I sold an idea to,
like, that was the moment that I

142
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:24,418
really kind of found, like, the
group that I liked to exist in,

143
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:28,288
and it- it's always propelled me
to have ideas and projects that

144
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:31,300
I like working on. But, you
know, going back, I still think

145
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,158
of the dorky kid

146
00:07:32,158 --> 00:07:36,658
that was sitting in his room,
reading the "HTML and CSS For

147
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:39,387
Dummies" book that he bought at
the thrift store for 50 cents.

148
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,778
And, you know, that's propelled
me into a lifelong period of not

149
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:47,247
only learning, but also figuring
things out and solving problems

150
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:51,700
in just a different way. Because
you know, I've come from a- a

151
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,708
place where

152
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:57,358
I've been building out a
necessity. And if you tell me if

153
00:07:57,358 --> 00:07:59,278
that there's a problem, I'll
figure out a way to fix it. The

154
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,278
way to fix it might not be the
best way. But it's working.

155
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:06,968
Dan: I love that. I- I love that
you're -- and- and like, I- I

156
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:09,500
think ... maybe not where you
ended up in your career path,

158
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,700
but the beginnings of [chuckles]
your career started off, this

159
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,198
very similar to mine,

160
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,738
right? I think I had that
exact same for dummies book that

161
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:20,000
I bought at the thrift store as
well. And, yeah, that -- I mean,

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
like, the- the- the cool thing
that -- for me is- is that,

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,300
like, how- how you ... sort of
organically followed, right,

164
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,748
what you- what you found
interesting,

165
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:31,800
what you saw, you know, need --
like, you saw there- there was a

166
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,287
need for

167
00:08:33,318 --> 00:08:35,868
different pieces to different
puzzles, right? And the

168
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:38,418
idea

169
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,268
that you don't have to stay in
one lane, or- or- or one

170
00:08:41,268 --> 00:08:44,118
specialty,

171
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:46,969
or anything like that, right? I
mean, fu- full stack developer's

172
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:52,500
a pretty common phrase these
days, I think. But I-I-I think

173
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,000
that- I think that my favorite
part about that — the full stack

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
ideas — is- is the idea that,
like, you- you have the power --

175
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,500
I mean, like, any person has the power to [chuckles] kinda go

176
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
and- and chase down, you know,
something that they wanna --

178
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,203
that they find interesting
and wanna- and wanna build,

179
00:09:06,203 --> 00:09:08,913
or wanna fix, or wanna solve.
Like, that's really cool.

180
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:12,033
Roger: Something that would
happen when I was working as a

181
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:13,818
technician is, you know, I'd
come in and I'd fix a- a problem

182
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:15,603
that

183
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:19,624
for the user was really, really
difficult. And I made it seem

184
00:09:19,714 --> 00:09:22,923
impossibly easy. And a lot of
them would say, "Wow, you're a

185
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:27,274
wizard. You fix it like magic."
And when you sit in front of,

186
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:32,043
you know, a- a- a terminal for
the first time, so to speak, and

187
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:34,500
you run that code, and it does
the thing that you told it to,

188
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,433
like, it feels like magic. It
feels like you cast a spell and

189
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:41,000
something cool happened. And,
you know, I feel like that-

190
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,178
that magic is

190
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:45,178
captivating for- for a lot of
people. And like, once you- once

191
00:09:45,178 --> 00:09:48,500
you see it, once you realize
that you can cast that spell and

192
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,000
make that

193
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,928
magic happen, like, it's almost
an addiction. Like, you're

194
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:54,000
like, Oh, what other things can
I do?" It's like, "Oh, yeah.

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,358
This

196
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:57,239
doorbell is no longer supported.
Let's see if we can, you know,

197
00:09:57,239 --> 00:10:00,538
hack it and make it something-
something useful again." Like,

198
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:04,198
it's just, you find solutions to
problems that, you know, you

199
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:07,438
didn't even know were problems
because now, you know the magic

200
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:08,458
behind how it all works.

201
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:12,850
Bekah: Yeah, I love how you talk
so much about the- the magic and

202
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,100
the problem solving. And I
think, that's one of the things

203
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,980
that interest so many people
about being in tech, and it's

204
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,700
simultaneously one of the most
frustrating things about being

206
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,221
in tech, right? Like, it can get
hard and you're stuck on those

207
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:28,000
problems in ... it -- sometimes,
it causes feelings of

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,305
self-doubt, like,

209
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:32,700
"Oh, what kind of programmer am
I? I can't figure this out."

210
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,205
So, how

211
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:37,525
do you approach problem solving
and- and maybe avoid those

212
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:40,466
feelings? Or do you have tips on
how to avoid those feelings?

213
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:45,946
Roger: You know, so much of what
I've been able to figure out has

214
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:49,605
been a, "Let me just change this
line of code, refresh, and see

215
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:52,700
if it fixes the problem." And,
you know, I come from a

216
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,671
background of

217
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,941
fixing a lot of weird problems
that I never had a- a -- say, in

218
00:10:56,941 --> 00:11:00,000
creating. And so, a lot of the
times, it was like, "Okay, this

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
was doing a thing correctly ...
before, and this is how we got

221
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,350
to there.

221
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:07,230
Now, when I try to do these
steps, this is what happens.

222
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:09,700
Well, now, I know how to
replicate the problem. And I

223
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,259
gonna just

224
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,640
work backwards from there and
try to figure out why it's

225
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,020
failing in

226
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,500
that step. And okay. Well, now
we know it's this problem. Let's

227
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,201
search around and see if we can
figure out if there's a solution

228
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:23,245
for this somewhere that we can
use or if we just keep having to

230
00:11:23,245 --> 00:11:26,500
dig further down." So, it's kind
of more of a beat it with a

232
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,300
hammer until it shows you, like,
something that's useful, and

233
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,894
then, you take

234
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:33,416
that little spec and it's like,
"Okay, let's analyze this, and

235
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,000
go down a rabbit hole, and solve
that problem, and then move on

236
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,446
to the

237
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,500
next error." And eventually,
you'll find kind of the answer.

238
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,196
And then,

239
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:43,676
once you have, like, that
experiences to that one problem,

240
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,300
you- you know that that
networking piece equip- of

241
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,375
equipment in the closet

241
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,846
was actually the faulty, you
know, problem the whole thing.

242
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:53,000
And it was a bad ethernet cable
that somebody, you know, broken

243
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,566
the door

243
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:57,466
that caused everybody's issues
for the day. And now, in the

244
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,895
future, when you're sitting in
there looking at that similar,

245
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:00,255
you know,

245
00:12:00,255 --> 00:12:02,895
problem, you know, your mind is
thinking about these things as

246
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:05,700
well, whereas before, it may
have taken you hours to get

247
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:05,926
there.

247
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:08,716
Well, now I know I can overcome
that because I had to do it in a

248
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:11,956
time of crisis. And I can -- if
I can overcome that, this little

249
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:13,816
error that I'm dealing with
I'll figure out eventually. And

250
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,676
it's

251
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:19,005
the same thing with programming.
Like, I was dealing with, like,

252
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:24,451
just ... some data formats that
I wasn't familiar with. And I

253
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,721
wanted to just sort of see if I
could figure it out. It took a

254
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:29,250
little while, but eventually,
you know, I put enough pieces to

255
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,779
the

256
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,715
puzzle together and I got the
answer I needed. And, like, it-

257
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:34,650
it

258
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,441
was one of those moments where
it's like, I overcame something

259
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:39,376
that was only existed because
the way that I formatted the

260
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,311
first

261
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:44,160
time wasn't necessarily the
correct way to parse that data.

262
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,700
But then once I figured out the
right way, it, like, it worked.

263
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,005
And then

263
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm sitting there, being like,
"Ha! And now it works." And

264
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,076
instantly, I was trying to find
the next problem to solve.

265
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:58,147
Dan: Yeah. That dopamine rush
from actually solving the

266
00:12:58,147 --> 00:13:00,300
thing, right? And it- it- it's,
like, greater -- I feel like,

267
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:00,996
for me, at

267
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:04,000
least, most of the time, anyway
[chuckles], it's- it's greater.

268
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,500
The harder it is, you know, the-

269
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,527
the deeper down the rabbit
hole you go, right? There's

270
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:12,000
sometimes where ... I get all
the way down and I figured it

271
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,300
out. But it's just taken me so
long, [chuckles] that- that I'm

272
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,700
just, like, "I- I just hate
this." Like, "Finally, it's --

274
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,000
this bug is squashed," you know?
[Laughs] But I think, lots of

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,936
times, I get that- I

276
00:13:21,937 --> 00:13:25,547
get that same- that same, like,
spike of just feels good. I'm

278
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:27,216
like, "Okay, let's find out
what's next," you know?

279
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:29,000
I think it's so cool.

279
00:13:29,856 --> 00:13:33,756
Roger: I've had times where I
spent a- a lot of the night in

280
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:37,057
networking closet, trying to
solve some weird networking

281
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:40,000
problem, and trying to get
something that was on the

282
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,417
network

283
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:43,300
that was working before I got
there wasn't working now, to

284
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:43,715
back

285
00:13:43,716 --> 00:13:46,836
to that working state. And it's
hot, and it's terrible, and I'm

286
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:49,927
hungry. And so, anytime that I'm
sitting in front of my computer

287
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:52,500
working on a hard coding
problem, I think back. I think

288
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,281
back to myself

289
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:56,042
and the networking closet. And
remember, I'm not there, and I

290
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:59,000
can't eat something, and I can't
step away, and it is fine.

291
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Because I will figure it out.

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,361
And it's- it's kind of, like,
the sense of encouragement

292
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:05,552
that I tell myself when I'm
dealing with the hard problem.

293
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:07,922
Just knowing that eventually it
will be solved one way or

294
00:14:07,922 --> 00:14:11,300
another. And there's only so
much I can worry about with it

295
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,730
right

296
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:14,500
now. And eventually, you just
have to say enough's enough,

298
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,000
walk away, and come back to it later. And you're like, "Oh,

299
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
yeah! You know what? I don't
know why this is so hard

300
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,432
earlier. I was just grumpy."

302
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,000
Dan: I think that's great
advice. And I- I like -- I wanna

303
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,351
reiterate

304
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:27,000
that cuz that's the -- one of
the hardest things to remember.

306
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And it's so easy to get stuck in
that. Like, it's- it's so easy

307
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,282
-- it's-

308
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:35,032
it's like when you're down in
some hole, you know, trying to

309
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:37,942
figure something out and nothing
makes sense. It's hard to step

310
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:41,000
away. It's -- at least for me,
it's hard. I ca- I have a hard

311
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,142
time stepping away.

311
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:46,761
And -- but you're right, Roger.
Like, every time that I do, it's

312
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,500
helpful. Like, it's always
helpful. And I'm always like,

313
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,700
"Why didn't I just do this an
hour ago?" [Chuckles] Like, "Why

314
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,000
didn't I just go walk around
the building, or go get it --

316
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,500
you know, across the street, get
a cup of coffee or something?"

317
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,700
Like, that- that -- it -- every
time -- you know, not every

318
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,412
time, but it-

318
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:02,871
it happens to me so often, you
know? And it- it's like, I don't

319
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:05,481
know, almost physically hard to-
to get myself to step away. I'm

320
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:07,192
like, "I know I can get this if
I just --"

321
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:09,667
Bekah: I always get annoyed when
people are like, "Just step up-

322
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:10,300
Dan: Yeah. Right.

322
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:11,500
Bekah: -you just need to go for
a walk." I'm like, "You just

323
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,300
don't need to tell me what to
do," right? And then, like an

324
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,500
hour and a half later, I'm doing
it. I'm like, "Oh, go- okay.

325
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,667
Fine." Like, "Yes, now I- I get
it." Like [laughs] --

326
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:23,407
Roger: I think, part of that is
you know that there's, like,

327
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:26,256
that dopamine rush when you're
gonna solve the problem. And

328
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:29,000
so, you're like, "I -- if I just
do this a little bit longer, it

330
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,300
will be solved, and I'm gonna
feel good about it. So, you're-

331
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,797
you're- you're

331
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:35,976
so in the middle of, like, that
frustrating piece where you

332
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,586
just, like, you know the payoff
is gonna be so much better

333
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:40,626
than more frustrated at the
problem that you're gonna -- you

334
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:43,500
are, that you just wanna finish
it. And stepping away is almost

335
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,076
like a

335
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:48,000
sign of defeat into yourself. No
one else cares. But you- but you

336
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,596
do. At -- but even so,

337
00:15:49,596 --> 00:15:54,517
like, that- that step away is
what you need. And yet, doing it

338
00:15:54,517 --> 00:15:56,797
is so f-frustratingly difficult.

339
00:15:57,927 --> 00:16:00,300
Bekah: Yeah. There's -- I was
working on this problem last

340
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,677
week. And I knew that I

341
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:06,200
was close, right? Like, I could
feel it, there's something

342
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,506
wrong.

342
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:11,001
And I- I just needed to spend
more time going over line by

343
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:14,062
line, which I had already done.
I had already done with other

344
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:19,500
people too. And then, finally, I
-- well, then I go into this

345
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:19,970
mode of,

346
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:23,500
"All right. I know that one of
these things is wrong." And then

348
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,000
I just start, like, throwing
code at it, chaotically. It just

349
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
not what you should do
[chuckles].

349
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,621
Because somewhere in there, I
had the right piece. But then, I

350
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:41,000
messed up the other piece that
connected it, and so -- then, it

351
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,300
still didn't work. And then I- I
was debugging it with a

352
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,000
coworker. And they're -- they
said, "Oh, yeah. It's this

353
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
thing. This is what I expected
it was," you know?

354
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,591
"You- you forgot to ..." I was
like, "I did have that. I had

355
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:57,700
it at one point. I just deleted
it, okay?" And- and so,

356
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,000
instead, I had this mess of a- a
codebase that -- that's not what

357
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,700
you want. So, like, taking,

358
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:10,632
I think, that -- taking that
advice of walking away, thinking

360
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:14,051
through the problem, rather than
just, like, throwing all of the

361
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:18,402
things at it is a- a skill I
need to learn, maybe? [Chuckles]

362
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:23,876
Roger: Yeah. Other approach that
I like to the mingled codebase

363
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,700
is the burn it all to the
ground, take what we know is

364
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,057
good, and

364
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:29,426
let's just start over for a
little bit. Cuz we learned a

365
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:33,027
lot and throwing all of this
spaghetti against the wall, but

366
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:35,606
yet nothing really stucks. But
we've learned some stuff in the

367
00:17:35,606 --> 00:17:38,000
process. So we gonna take what
the good bits that we know, go

368
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,516
back to

369
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:41,936
where we know the data is good,
and try to do what fit, what we

370
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:45,721
want. And probably, starting
over with a fresh slate is gonna

371
00:17:45,721 --> 00:17:49,000
give us the answers we need,
because we were not good when we

373
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,852
were writing that other code. We
were frustrated.

374
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,500
Dan: Yeah. And I think that's
great advice and- and it helps

375
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,075
sort of

376
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:57,747
isolate, you know, you can still
add things a bit at a time, you

377
00:17:57,747 --> 00:18:00,700
know? So, starting from that
fresh -- the fresh, like ... the

378
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,106
fresh,

378
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:04,396
like, you know, add things step
by step, you know? And- and you-

379
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:08,396
you very, like, you know how you
want it to work. So, maybe the-

380
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:10,500
the route will be a little bit
more straight forward this way,

381
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:10,796
right?

382
00:18:10,886 --> 00:18:14,527
Cuz you have, like, a plan in
your head. But it'll help you

383
00:18:14,616 --> 00:18:18,217
sort of isolate the problem too.
And that's good advice. The

384
00:18:18,217 --> 00:18:19,926
spaghetti on the wall method,
right? [Chuckles]

385
00:18:22,497 --> 00:18:26,500
Bekah: My favorite method.
So, one of the things that we

386
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,500
talk a lot about at Virtual
Coffee is asking questions.

388
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:64,700
And I think that this kind of
goes along with the conversation

389
00:18:64,700 --> 00:18:35,706
about, you know, how

390
00:18:35,707 --> 00:18:39,487
do you ask questions? How do you
ask for help? Like, what is the

391
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,457
right approach to doing that?
And it can be in your codebase,

393
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:45,300
it could be when you're
interviewing for a job, but what

394
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:45,845
do you think

395
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:50,616
is a good approach to asking
questions or asking for support

396
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:52,267
or help for finding it?

397
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:57,000
Roger: So, it kind of- kind of
depends on the problem,

398
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,575
right? If

399
00:18:57,576 --> 00:19:00,487
you're talking about, you know,
you're sitting on an interview

400
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:05,332
and you wanna know if they do
X, Y, or Z, right? You just ask.

401
00:19:05,422 --> 00:19:09,471
And like, it seems scary at
first, but every company that

402
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:11,300
I've been in the first interview
with, and I've been like, "So,

403
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:11,691
what

404
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,751
kind of like hardware stack are
we dealing with?" They're always

405
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:17,000
like, "Wait. Why do you care?"
Like, "You're interviewing for

406
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,500
this role."

407
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,221
And it's like, "Well, no. I
genuinely wanna make sure it's

408
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:20,991
something that I'm gonna be
interested in dealing with,

409
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:24,000
before, like, I get excited and
we waste everybody's time, and

411
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
then I get to the job, and it's
not exciting." Like -- and each

412
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,422
time that

412
00:19:29,422 --> 00:19:32,700
I've asked, like, weird,
difficult questions or just

413
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,291
something that

413
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:36,561
I was just curious about, i-it's
always needed a good result in

414
00:19:36,561 --> 00:19:40,162
the interview. Like, I
remember in one, where I asked

415
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:43,000
the ... founder of the company,
where he sees himself in the

416
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,122
organization in

416
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:49,041
five years. And that was a- that
was a fun question to see the

417
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,294
last on [??] all of the other
managers, where they're just

418
00:19:51,294 --> 00:19:53,547
like ... [chuckles]. But the

419
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:57,176
answer that he gave me was more
about the vision of the company

420
00:19:57,176 --> 00:20:00,000
and where they wanted to take
it, which was really exciting.

422
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,500
And so you- you kind of take
that same approach when you're

423
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,912
dealing with code, right?

424
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:07,786
If you have a problem, you look
at your message. And I just

425
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:08,500
start by taking

426
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,991
your message, copying and
pasting to the search engine,

427
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:13,731
and then say, "Stack Overflow,
give me the great answers to my

428
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:17,400
problem." And combining that
with whatever language you're

429
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:17,781
writing

429
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:21,291
it in, and what you're trying to
do, typically nets somebody else

430
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:25,207
on the internet who has the same
problem. And there's probably an

431
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:28,500
XKCD that's relevant to that
exact topic because I've s-s-s

432
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,517
-- [Dan chuckles] linked

432
00:20:30,517 --> 00:20:34,237
to it many times. And it's just
-- it's kind of that. Like, you

433
00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:36,096
know, it doesn't matter what
the problem you're dealing with,

434
00:20:36,096 --> 00:20:38,376
there- there's an answer out
there somewhere. Somebody knows

435
00:20:38,376 --> 00:20:40,500
that answer to the problem
you're dealing with. And it's

436
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,706
just how do we

437
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:45,457
get there? And sometimes, the
answer is you need to call the

438
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:49,500
vendor or email the person that
wrote it. And it seems

439
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:49,991
terrifying

440
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:53,142
the first dozen times that you
email somebody that wrote some

441
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:57,000
piece of code, but something
that I've learned about

442
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
developers and people that work
in technology is given an

443
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,432
opportunity to talk about

443
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:06,000
something nerdy. We're gonna
waste as much time as we

445
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,000
possibly can, because it's so
rare that we get somebody who's,

446
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,730
like, excited

447
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:12,402
about the same thing that we're
doing. And then, it's just like,

448
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:15,852
"Okay. Yeah. That took so much
effort to write that email. But

449
00:21:15,852 --> 00:21:17,981
now, like, I know this guy and
we're gonna totally meet for

450
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:20,082
drinks when he's at this
conference, because, like,

451
00:21:20,082 --> 00:21:23,500
that's the connection we made."
And it's just about asking the

452
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:23,892
questions, and

452
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:28,207
just finding the right person.
And ... everybody's got an email

453
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:31,500
address on their code, or you
can message them in Twitter,

454
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
which is still a weird

455
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,307
experience, just to be able to
message some random company and

456
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:39,000
being like, "Hey, I have this
thing. Would you be interested?"

458
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And then next thing you know,
you on a meeting to, you know,

459
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
meet the person that posted
that tweet.

460
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,500
And ... that's kind of the whole
power that we have today where

461
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,300
we didn't have life [??] in --
like, when I got started in

462
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,092
technology, there was- there was
no

462
00:21:53,092 --> 00:21:55,761
Facebook, there was no MySpace.
It seems like a weird time

463
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:59,000
because I'm not that old. But
in the- in the age of tech, you

464
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,500
know, you -- it moves at such a
rapid pace

465
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,311
that you are ... [chuckles] you
get dated very

466
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:07,402
quickly if you haven't paying
attention. And at that time

467
00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:10,000
period, like, finding
information was a lot harder.

468
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But now, it's just ... at -- it
just depends on how persistent

470
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,436
you are and how bad you want
that thing or ...

471
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,257
in that answer. If you really,
really want the answer to the

472
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,717
question, you'll find it. It
just might take some time.

473
00:22:23,946 --> 00:22:25,000
Bekah: Sorry. I was- I was-

474
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,300
Dan: Yeah [chuckles].

475
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,557
Bekah: -I was thinking. I was
deep in thought [laughs].

474
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:28,791
Dan: I don't know. Yeah. I was
just reminiscing back when there

475
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,006
was no Stack Overflow [laughs].

476
00:22:30,721 --> 00:22:32,791
Bekah: My kids like to refer to
that as the olden days. We

477
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:35,192
watched the s- "The Amazing
Spider-Man", the one with Andrew

478
00:22:35,192 --> 00:22:37,561
Garfield this weekend. And
they're like, "Oh, we didn't

479
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:40,700
know that you had movies with
this good CGI back in the olden

480
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,392
days." I was like, "It's not
even that old!" [Chuckles]

481
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:46,176
Dan: [Chuckles] Kids.

482
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:50,594
Bekah: Yeah, well, okay. And so,
I think that making those

483
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:54,000
connections is so important and
then like asking- asking

484
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,492
informed

485
00:22:54,493 --> 00:22:58,663
questions too, right? Because
when you're DM-ing someone or

486
00:22:58,693 --> 00:23:04,000
emailing someone, you- you let
them know what you've been

487
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,814
working on

487
00:23:04,814 --> 00:23:07,500
or how you've been approaching
that thing. Or, you know, I --

488
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,300
one of the things that I like
about our Virtual Coffee

490
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:16,000
repository is we have issue
templates, we have PR templates,

491
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,700
or ... is that what they're
called? Templates? Forms?

492
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,300
Dan: Tem-

493
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,159
Bekah: Issue forms?

492
00:23:20,673 --> 00:23:21,003
Dan: -plates? [Laughs]

493
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:25,300
Bekah: Oh. Templates? Am- am
I saying it wrong? Well, I

494
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,700
dunno. I wasn't asking the-

495
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
Dan: I don't get that -- I
don't think-

496
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,700
Bekah: -correct choice to say
it. I was just been wondering-

497
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Dan: -I don't think that's a
wrong-

497
00:23:29,148 --> 00:23:30,739
Bekah: -if they are called
templates.

498
00:23:30,963 --> 00:23:34,000
Dan: -right/wrong situation. But
... I think that's more of a

499
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,324
local dialect situation
[laughs].

500
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:43,098
Bekah: It's not what I was
asking [laughs]. Forms issue?

503
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:46,700
Dan: Issue form. Yeah, forms.
Issue forms. That's what they're

504
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,673
called [inaudible]. Well, I
dunno. They started as

504
00:23:51,673 --> 00:23:53,594
templates and the other, forms.
That's it. Yeah.

505
00:23:53,713 --> 00:23:55,544
Bekah: [Laughs] Well, one of
them is a form, right?

506
00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:57,763
Dan: Right. Right. No, that's --
I mean, that, the issue ones.

508
00:23:57,763 --> 00:23:59,700
Yeah. They use- they used to be
-- we used to have issue

510
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,173
templates, and now we converted
them to the issue forms.

511
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:03,898
Roger: And now he just has an
issues everywhere.

512
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:06,854
Dan: Now there's just --
[laughs] I mean, lots of issues.

513
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:12,543
Bekah: But it breaks -- it kind
of, like, breaks down how to ask

515
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,723
questions. And because we work
with so many developers at all

516
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:19,300
stages of the journey, it- it's
nice to kind of create a

517
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,193
methodical

517
00:24:20,193 --> 00:24:25,953
process for question asking,
or helping people to go through

518
00:24:25,953 --> 00:24:29,300
this process of, "This is what I
see. This is what I've done.

519
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,300
This is what I want to see
done," you know? And providing

520
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,137
some evidence

521
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:41,000
for that. Because sometimes, you
have a random question, and ...

522
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
it feels exhausting or
overwhelming to try and answer

523
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,500
a question if there's no context

524
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,729
there, right? If you already
have a full slate of work

526
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:55,500
on your desk and somebody asks
you, "Hey, have you ..." I

527
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,000
don't- don't know. I can't think
of a good example right now. But

529
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,000
like, "Did I use this thing
right?" "Okay. Well, walk me

530
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,528
through your

530
00:25:05,528 --> 00:25:07,598
code," right? And I think that
that's one of those things that

531
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:10,500
kind of -- it's a skill that
takes time to develop that

532
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:10,929
question

532
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:14,000
asking ability. And a-another
reason why I love the- the

533
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
coworking room too, because you
have the time to have those

534
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,519
conversations.

535
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,769
And Roger, I know that you've
spent some time in the coworking

536
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,608
room as well.

537
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,500
Roger: Yeah. It's -- I- I always
love just kind of hanging out in

538
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,300
there cuz you never know what
kind of conversations are going

539
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:29,999
to have.

540
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:33,300
And it definitely feels like
you're at work, and these are

541
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:33,643
your

542
00:25:33,644 --> 00:25:37,544
coworkers. Because, you know,
there's- there's a sense of- of

543
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,574
community to it. But at the same
time, you know, like, the

544
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:43,300
conversations aren't going to
take a- a weird turn. They're

545
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,723
gonna typically stay around a- a
centralized set of topics. And

546
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:50,000
it- it's comforting to be able
-- to be just around other

547
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,253
people who are

547
00:25:51,253 --> 00:25:54,733
programmers, and nerds, and just
generally interested in pretty

548
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:57,344
much the same thing as you are.
And just being like, "Hey, I'm

549
00:25:57,344 --> 00:26:00,000
working on this, like, weird
code. Like, is there anybody

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,700
that wants to jump in and, like,

550
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,259
give me some advice on what I'm
doing wrong or

552
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:07,828
how I can make it better?" And,
you know, it's kind of exciting

553
00:26:07,828 --> 00:26:10,700
just to see the problem solving
that other people go through.

555
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,999
And sometimes, it's just the
patients that some people have

556
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:18,000
mentoring people. It- it's
really amazing and- and kind of,

557
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,679
you know, a l- a lead by

557
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,528
example in some places where you
see these things happen and

558
00:26:22,528 --> 00:26:25,199
you're just like, "Wow! I wanna-
I wanna improve how I instruct

560
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:28,828
people based off of, like, what
I just kinda saw." And it's just

561
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:32,300
kind of a cool place just to
meet people from kind of all

562
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:32,923
around

563
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:37,000
the world who just are hanging
out, just wanting to -- just

564
00:26:37,423 --> 00:26:37,423
chill

564
00:26:37,423 --> 00:26:40,423
for a few minutes, and just talk
about whatever- whatever you're

565
00:26:40,423 --> 00:26:43,000
talking about, jumping into the
conversation, and jump out.

566
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's- it's really, like, been a
great sense of community since,

567
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,433
you

568
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:51,104
know, honestly, I found Virtual
Coffee when the pandemic kind of

569
00:26:51,104 --> 00:26:54,013
was going on and, like, I dived
into there and I became kind of

570
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,000
... a lot of the close
friendships that I had. Because

571
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
it was just always open and you
meet a lot of really cool,

572
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,053
interesting people.

573
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:06,074
And actually, my current- my
current job, I was actually

574
00:27:06,104 --> 00:27:09,884
interviewed, originally, in
the coworking room, which led me

575
00:27:09,884 --> 00:27:12,554
to being interviewed by the
company and accepting the role

576
00:27:12,554 --> 00:27:15,000
with their -- so, I always think
that's a- that's a fun little

577
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,044
story with the Virtual Coffee,
because, you know, there's so

578
00:27:18,044 --> 00:27:22,100
many of these people that joined
looking for a job and -- or

579
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,700
hoping to find something.

579
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,500
But sometimes, you end up
finding something in the same

580
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,483
room that you're just hanging
out with. And then for fun,

581
00:27:28,483 --> 00:27:31,183
sharing just some project that
you had an idea about or

582
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,203
passionate about. So --

583
00:27:34,118 --> 00:27:39,000
Bekah: I love that. That's such
a fun story. Okay. So, you -- I

584
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,263
-- we're talking about problem
solving and- and ...

584
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:46,300
navigating through -- like,
enjoying that part -- that

585
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:52,000
aspect of coding. So, what is
the ... maybe strangest or most

586
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,888
complicated problem you've had
navigate?

587
00:27:56,098 --> 00:28:00,239
Roger: So, I think this goes
back to the days when I was

588
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:04,318
working in a support role at a
managed service provider, which

589
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:07,378
means, we ran their whole help
desk. And this is one of my

590
00:28:07,378 --> 00:28:10,919
favorite stories to tell because
it's just so weird. So, the

591
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:17,700
customer I was supporting is a
company that does -- that

592
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:18,009
paints

592
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:21,128
boats. When I'm talking about
boats, I'm talking about big

593
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:25,298
ships that are, you know, the-
the- the ships that they have at

594
00:28:25,298 --> 00:28:29,648
Disneyland type size. And they
have an oven that is the size of

595
00:28:29,648 --> 00:28:32,943
a literal warehouse, where they
put these boats and to have the

596
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:36,273
paint cure. And all of this data
from all of these temperature

597
00:28:36,273 --> 00:28:39,574
sensors from all around that
warehouse get fed into one

598
00:28:39,574 --> 00:28:44,163
computer. And what happened is
that aging desktop, which was

599
00:28:44,163 --> 00:28:47,884
running ... probably Windows 98
or something similar, and some

600
00:28:47,884 --> 00:28:53,534
version of Excel, it died. And
suddenly, their whole business

601
00:28:53,804 --> 00:28:57,000
wasn't able to operate because
the computer that ran the

602
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,402
sensors

603
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:00,523
that gave them the data to
certify all of their work wasn't

604
00:29:00,523 --> 00:29:04,663
working. And I remember trying
everything that I could to build

605
00:29:04,663 --> 00:29:08,054
a virtual machine that had that
operating system to run this

606
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:12,000
thing and just constant
problems. And eventually, I

607
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,884
solved that

608
00:29:13,183 --> 00:29:16,500
problem by getting it stood up
with a new version of Windows

609
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:16,993
and

610
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:21,584
everything working inside it.
And- and a version of Excel that

611
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:24,973
I found on an abandoned ware
website that was like a release

612
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:28,394
candidate that they didn't put
any product activations in. And

613
00:29:28,394 --> 00:29:31,003
it was the least to the current
version of Excel that I could

614
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:34,300
find to run the macro that this
business relied on to capture

615
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,084
this data

615
00:29:35,084 --> 00:29:39,403
from the sensor. It was- it was
a lot! We had adapters with the

616
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,500
serial cables pulling in this
data into a macro and

617
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,733
an excited [??] Excel.

617
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:47,114
And eventually, this all got
ran- ran into a Windows 10 box,

618
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:51,374
eventually, and virtualized, and
ran indefinitely, but it was

619
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:55,000
just the- the amount of sheer
... what is going on and how are

620
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
we gonna fix this, like,

621
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,608
to get over the finish line? It
was just astronomical. And like,

622
00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:04,500
I look back and I think to
myself, like, "You know, if I

624
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,500
could fix a boat of him,
none of these other problems

625
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,568
seem that hard. A little

626
00:30:08,568 --> 00:30:11,000
figure it out." Like, it's the
same thing about being in a

628
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
network closet. Like, that's --
that -- you just remember, like,

629
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,483
all of these problems have
solutions. You're gonna

629
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:21,173
get there eventually. It's just
a matter of [chuckles]

631
00:30:21,173 --> 00:30:23,693
what ridiculous thing you're
gonna need to get it across

632
00:30:23,693 --> 00:30:27,233
the finish line in the moment.
And I- I feel like, when

633
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:31,000
programming, it's a lot of ...
more -- a lot more critical

634
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,769
thinking, and

635
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:34,679
sometimes, you just need more
information. And just like, if

636
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:37,409
you dealing with the problem
with databases you can't really

637
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:40,919
figure out what the heck you're
doing, stop and, like, go look

638
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:44,000
at some completed databases. And
then, you're like, "Oh, that's

640
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
what I was do it. Gronk [??]."
And suddenly, things click into

641
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,077
place. And, you know, I

642
00:30:49,078 --> 00:30:52,858
just remember so many times as a
technician where there wasn't

643
00:30:52,858 --> 00:30:57,388
documentation or somebody to
ask. It was figure it out to the

644
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,700
best that you can. Because
they're -- the vendor that built

645
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,000
this system went out of business
before you were born. And ...

646
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,963
[Dan chuckles] and that's-

647
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,700
and that's a fun- that's a fun
place to exist. But the thing

648
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,544
that I've learned the most about
programming, and programming

649
00:31:10,544 --> 00:31:14,500
languages specifically, is once
you learn the basics, they all

650
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,500
start to kind of merge together.
And if you know how an if loop

651
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:18,943
and a

652
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:22,723
while loop works well, you can
pretty much program like 90% of

653
00:31:22,723 --> 00:31:26,338
the crap you need to get the job
done. A-and that's really what

654
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:29,500
it takes. Like, a few- a few if
statements, and you've got most

655
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:29,788
of

656
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:32,909
the programs that are running
some of the largest systems are

657
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:37,500
just simple things. And when you
can look at a coding language

658
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,700
that's written in something that
some random developer came up

659
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,909
with and you're

660
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:44,700
just able to read thoroughly and
understand it because -- not

662
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,500
because you understand the
programming language, but

663
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,769
because you understand that a

663
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:51,378
loop's going to keep going back
through these things, and

664
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:53,758
eventually it's gonna do
this, so now I'm looking for

666
00:31:53,758 --> 00:31:57,000
this problem, you can pretty
much go down any rabbit hole and

667
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
find what you're looking for.
Just as long as you're just

668
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
willing to keep ... looking.

668
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,000
It's the same thing with the
boat [unintelligible]. I just

669
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,300
kept looking and then I found --
eventually found a way to fix

670
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,638
it.

670
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:11,500
Dan: Yeah. I love that. And I-
and I think that -- and I feel

672
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,618
like I've said this, probably,
before. But that's, like, one of

673
00:32:13,618 --> 00:32:16,700
the biggest things that
separates somebody that has more

674
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,338
experience

675
00:32:17,338 --> 00:32:21,419
from somebody who is more
starting out is not necessarily

676
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:28,000
the knowledge accrued, but more
the sort of confidence that you

677
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,500
can do the thing. You -- like --
that- that, like, you can

678
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,700
probably solve pretty much
anything given, you know,

678
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,500
enough time, I suppose. But
like, you know, like- like you

679
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,898
said, like that -- if you- if
you have less experience, you

681
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:43,409
just have less plack- practice
reading code and being used

682
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:48,000
to loops, and- and if
statements, and stuff. Then

683
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,209
jumping -- trying to read

684
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:51,278
some other code in a different
language that you're not used to

685
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:54,098
is gonna seem ... probably a lot
more daunting, you know? But

686
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:57,729
having done it for a long time,
it's -- i-is a sec- that- that's

687
00:32:57,729 --> 00:33:00,000
a practice, you know? The
practice of just, like ...

689
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,500
[chuckles] yeah, I mean, it's
just like you said, you know?

688
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,179
Like, I have solved this huge
bug in the -- in- in- in the

689
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:07,000
past. So I just kind of know
that any other bug that comes

691
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,459
up, I'm gonna be fine, [laughs]
right?

692
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:14,300
Roger: Or, on the- on the other
side of it is, like, "I know

693
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,000
I've taken down production
once."

694
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,500
Dan: [Chuckles] Oh, god.

695
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,679
Roger: "So if I do it again, I-
I know what to expect."

694
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:23,959
It's sort of like, "I've been
chewed out. Let's just get

695
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:24,739
chewed out again." [Dan laughs]

696
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:27,000
Bekah: It's all-

697
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,300
Dan: Yeah.

697
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,959
Bekah: -feel like terrifying
experience to me [laughs].

697
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:31,548
Dan: Have- have you done it live
on a Twitch stream though?

698
00:33:31,548 --> 00:33:33,854
[Laughs]

698
00:33:33,854 --> 00:33:35,653
Roger: There's still time.
There's still time.

699
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,108
Bekah: [Laughs] No. No, thank
you.

700
00:33:38,503 --> 00:33:42,644
Dan: Yeah. That was ... not my
best moment. But I got

701
00:33:42,644 --> 00:33:43,153
through it, right? [Laughs]

702
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:48,000
Bekah: You- you did. You -- I
think I would just ... I ...

703
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
want to crawl under the bed and-

704
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Dan: Yeah. Mm.

705
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,628
Bekah: -stay there.

704
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:54,788
Roger: I- I think this is a good
point to mention how important

705
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:59,138
backups and version control are.
And don't be afraid to commit

706
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:02,528
that code, even if you're not
quite ready for it. Just having

707
00:34:02,528 --> 00:34:04,500
like something in there that you
can go back and look at and be

708
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,148
like, "That's what I did four
and half hours ago."

709
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,028
Dan: Yes.

710
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:09,369
Roger: It's still helpful. It's
so helpful.

711
00:34:10,268 --> 00:34:10,838
Dan: Yes.

712
00:34:11,474 --> 00:34:13,000
Bekah: Yeah. Even like that
project that I was just talking

713
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,934
about, I

713
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:18,704
was talking through it with Kirk
one day. He's like, "Well, you

714
00:34:18,704 --> 00:34:22,000
know, have you committed
recently?" And I was like, "I

715
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,159
don- I don't have any commits
[laughs]."

715
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,688
But just like, you know, I --
it wasn't going to be a big

717
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:31,139
project. I thought that I could
do it really quickly and get it

718
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,849
done. And then, it was like,
"Ooh."

719
00:34:33,798 --> 00:34:34,068
Dan: Yeah.

720
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:36,000
Bekah: "This was a mistake."
Yeah. That would have been that

721
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,099
-- for sure, would have been
useful.

722
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,509
Dan: Yeah, no. That's very good
advice too. I-it's, like, at the

723
00:34:41,509 --> 00:34:42,739
times that I've done it, it's
been- it's been super helpful.

725
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:46,099
And it helps with that -- and it
gives you more confidence with

726
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:49,179
that -- the approach of just
kind of trying stuff out, right?

727
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:53,000
Throwing stuff at the problem.
Because, you know, that -- it --

728
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,414
I mean,

728
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:56,083
it's easy- it's easy to go back,
right? It's easy to throw things

729
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:58,873
out, it's easy to go and look at
your history. And you can

730
00:34:58,873 --> 00:35:00,000
always, like, if you're
embarassed by that [chuckles],

731
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
the commits or the commi- like,
you know, it's just kind of

732
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
squashed them, right, into --
like, once you finally solve it

734
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,300
into one commit, you know? But
I- I mean, I'll have commits

736
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,500
that are just like, "Well, let's
try this, try this, try this.

737
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,303
That didn't work. Try this,

738
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:15,000
try this," you know? [Chuckles]
And that's, like, that's not

739
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,643
what you wanna

740
00:35:15,643 --> 00:35:19,963
push up ... ultimately. But it's
perfectly fine when you're in

741
00:35:19,963 --> 00:35:22,500
your -- when you're like, you
know, trying to work your way

742
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,083
through-

743
00:35:23,143 --> 00:35:26,623
through a problem. At least-
at least I think it is. I don't

744
00:35:26,623 --> 00:35:28,963
know [chuckles]. Other people
might disagree with me. But --

745
00:35:29,764 --> 00:35:32,764
Roger: I am definitely afraid to
commit until, like, the code is

746
00:35:33,063 --> 00:35:35,500
per- perfect, just because I
feel like so many people are

747
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:35,943
gonna be

748
00:35:35,943 --> 00:35:39,304
judging me based off of what
they're saying. But at the

749
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,500
same time, that causes me to
forget to commit my changes.

751
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:47,000
And I have a habit of doing that
frequently, which the best part

752
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,500
about being a developer is you
can always automate solutions to

754
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,700
your problems. One of mine has
been every 15 minutes, take a

755
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,648
git commit, and just go ahead,
and just save that with the

756
00:35:59,648 --> 00:36:04,500
timestamp. And I've written that
as a bash script, because that

757
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:04,918
was the

758
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:08,639
easiest, lowest hanging fruit
that I could do. And it works

759
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:13,079
marvelously. And I've used that
for a number of other projects

760
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:17,300
where I wrote a whole- a whole
set of scripts that took and

762
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,300
used them as a note-taking
application with an auto-save

764
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,009
and sync functionality powered
by git and bash that just was a

765
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:28,500
few hours of just starting
things together because I was

766
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,813
annoyed that I forgot to save

766
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:32,123
something important into the
thing that I was using as a

767
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:36,000
notepad. So I'm like, "I'm never
gonna do this again!" And it,

768
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,703
you know, you solve a problem,
and you just use the tools that

769
00:36:37,703 --> 00:36:41,000
were available, and ... yeah.

770
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,000
Dan: I love that.

771
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:45,123
Bekah: Do you have a blog post
or a tutorial on the things that

772
00:36:45,123 --> 00:36:46,954
you've done? Cuz that would be
super [unintelligible].

773
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:50,000
Roger: I definitely should write
this one up because I think I

774
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,207
had

775
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,748
intended to, but then I, again,
got distracted and forgot to

776
00:36:53,748 --> 00:36:57,648
complete it, which I- I- I could
say that a lot about a lot of

778
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,700
the domains that I purchased.
It's about being like, "Hey,

779
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,558
this is an idea."

780
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:04,000
"Ooh, the domain's available."
"Oh, I should build this." And

782
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,838
then, I get the renewal notice a
year later.

783
00:37:08,498 --> 00:37:09,000
Bekah: You have-

784
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,700
Dan: [Chuckles] That's alright.

785
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,009
Bekah: -a domain with an emoji
in it, right?

784
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:17,000
Roger: So, I am actually the
proud owner of the email

785
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,784
emoji.fm. And

786
00:37:18,784 --> 00:37:23,463
I have been trying to figure out
the best way to create an emoji

787
00:37:23,463 --> 00:37:27,603
base, social networking, email
platform around that. That is

788
00:37:27,603 --> 00:37:33,079
just purely nothing but emojis.
But amazingly enough, it is a

789
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:36,048
surprisingly difficult to get
emails delivered that contain

790
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:40,099
emojis. So, I have been trying
to overcome a lot of fun

791
00:37:40,128 --> 00:37:45,108
technical problems getting that
service spun up. But ... yeah.

792
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:49,000
That's- that's a lot of [laughs]
entertainment in itself. It is

793
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
just, "Hey, go check out this
emoji email and -- or domain."

794
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,700
And you're just like, "I didn't
even know emojis could be

795
00:37:54,700 --> 00:38:00,000
domains." And ... it- it causes
a lot of things that you

796
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,384
shouldn't be buying two
interior ... credit card bill.

797
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:09,700
Bekah: I love that. I always ...
love hearing stories. You tell

798
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,500
stories about

799
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,094
the things that you're doing,
because like, one, they're super

800
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:15,704
entertaining, but then also, you
come out with stuff like that.

801
00:38:15,704 --> 00:38:19,000
Like, "Yeah, I've bought an
emoji domain [chuckles] that

802
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,884
never would have crossed my mind
to even try doing."

803
00:38:22,713 --> 00:38:25,300
Roger: I don't just have one. I
have a- a specific one that I've

804
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,744
been putting together for a
authentication service that is

805
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:33,000
themed about a wizard. And it --
the link is literally the link

806
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,500
emoji with the magic wand
because they're magic links. And

807
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,000
so the whole idea

808
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,333
is making a- a- a single sign on
magic link service that uses

809
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:46,264
emojis as the links, just
because, like -- in- in the

810
00:38:46,264 --> 00:38:49,000
right audience, it's- it's
really entertaining. But it-

811
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
it's also, you know, a lot
harder the -- to forge those

812
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
because, you know, how many
people are gonna be using emojis

813
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,469
in their thing? [Chuckles]

814
00:38:58,048 --> 0:38:58,500
Bekah: Well-

815
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,000
Dan: [Chuckles] That's pretty
cool.

816
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,000
Bekah: -once you- you get
investors, everybody's gonna be

815
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,500
using it. It's gonna be the next
big thing. It won't- it won't be

816
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,139
something of the olden days.
It'll be of the newen days.

817
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:12,478
Roger: Well, the thing that I
love about emojis is — especially

818
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:14,300
like in Virtual Coffee — it's a
good example. We have an

819
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,058
international

820
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:17,300
community of developers that
come together. But the thing

822
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,700
that is most universal is the
wave emoji. Like, everybody

823
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,300
knows what that

824
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,500
means. Everybody can react and,
like, emojis in- in themself

826
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,500
almost a universal language.
Doesn't matter which one you

827
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,000
speak or read, the emojis are
pretty much being the same

828
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,518
thing.

828
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:35,500
Bekah: Okay. So- so you have --
I was gonna ask, one- one of my

829
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,568
questions was, like,

830
00:39:36,597 --> 00:39:40,300
what is the- the coolest problem
that you want to solve? And

831
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,000
you're- you're talking about
some cool things. So I dunno if

833
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
you've already mentioned it, or
if you've got another big idea

834
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,097
you wanna share.

835
00:39:48,228 --> 00:39:51,648
Roger: I think- I think the one
that when I talked about the-

836
00:39:51,648 --> 00:39:54,500
the eyes light up of behind
everybody being like, "Why I

838
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,000
didn't even know that that was,
like, something that people were

839
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,100
thinking about?" And it's

840
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,538
kind of one of the things that
I found, like, that I first love

841
00:40:02,538 --> 00:40:05,700
of communities and it- it
surrounds zombies actually,

842
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,000
which is kind of, like, what
makes everybody laugh. And I

843
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,293
want -- and I am building a

844
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:14,700
whole platform that does,
essentially, a distributed

845
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,222
network

846
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:19,693
of servers that cash basically a
copy of, like, the internet

847
00:40:19,693 --> 00:40:22,700
archive, the public domain
knowledge. And stores them in

848
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,700
kind of a way that makes it
accessible in, like -- the idea

849
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:31,000
behind it is this- this whole
nonprofit in self-sufficiency,

850
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,853
rebuilding, and being

850
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:36,963
resourceful with just what you
have. And part of it comes from

851
00:40:37,592 --> 00:40:42,032
my desire just to wanna host
what I call Zombie Con and where

852
00:40:42,032 --> 00:40:46,023
you got a junk pile of computers
and a challenge. And you throw a

853
00:40:46,023 --> 00:40:48,603
bunch of nerds that say, "Okay,
rebuild the internet. And here's

854
00:40:48,603 --> 00:40:51,693
what you get to use for it."
Because I think, when you're

855
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:54,000
building out of necessity, the
solutions that you come to

856
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,401
problems become so much
different

857
00:40:57,463 --> 00:41:03,402
than when you have the luxury of
both time and resources. And I

858
00:41:03,402 --> 00:41:05,922
feel like something special will
come out of that, that I don't

859
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:10,000
even realize. But I just --
every time that I kinda talk

860
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,353
about

860
00:41:10,413 --> 00:41:13,353
that particular side of things,
like, it gets people excited

861
00:41:13,353 --> 00:41:17,193
because, you know, there's a
sense in all of us that I feel

862
00:41:17,193 --> 00:41:20,000
like you want that dopamine
effect of being like, "I did

863
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,012
it," whether it's solving a
problem with your code, it's

864
00:41:23,012 --> 00:41:24,662
fixing a server, or if it's,

865
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:25,982
like, just simpling -- simple as
patching that drywall, and

866
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:29,000
looking back, and be like, "You
can't even tell!"

867
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,813
[Bekah and Dan laugh] It's that sense of pride and, like,

868
00:41:30,813 --> 00:41:33,123
accomplishment that you get out
of, like, the work that you do

869
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,300
that drives all of us. And the-
the thing that I've really

870
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:36,813
wanted to build

870
00:41:36,813 --> 00:41:39,693
is the -- just the way that we
can share that and, like, make

871
00:41:39,693 --> 00:41:42,500
these things being like, "This
is how you patch a drywall, and

872
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,523
open sourcing those, and making
them available as many people

874
00:41:45,523 --> 00:41:48,500
that are interested in it." And
just trying to figure out ways

875
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,131
to, again, make it

876
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:53,222
accessible and last through the
apocalypse. Because I feel like

877
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:55,922
that's the hardest challenge you
could ever possibly think about.

878
00:41:56,402 --> 00:42:01,000
And ... thinking about ways to
solve that, to just make your

879
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,562
... I don't

880
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:03,693
know. It just keeps me up at
night [chuckles].

881
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:07,353
Bekah: Yeah. That's really
interesting.

882
00:42:07,697 --> 00:42:10,936
Roger: Like, our most valuable
resource is our knowledge. And

883
00:42:10,936 --> 00:42:15,077
if we have to start over, losing
our knowledge base as a humanity

884
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:18,617
would be the most detrimental
thing. And so, the more that we

885
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:21,300
work through figure out a way
to not only maintain that, but

886
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,700
also use that data.

886
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,277
And- and part of what drives the
fun on this is, like,

887
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:29,476
you can download the entirety of
Stack Overflow as a SQL database

888
00:42:30,032 --> 00:42:34,382
to your computer. And now you
have the entirety of all of the

889
00:42:34,382 --> 00:42:37,700
question and answers that you've
needed to fix your programming

890
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:37,980
at

891
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:42,302
your fingertips. It's only up to
you to figure out how to query

892
00:42:42,302 --> 00:42:45,500
that data to find the answers
you need. And I think, like,

893
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,700
doing that offline, where you
don't have connection to the

894
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,242
internet,

894
00:42:48,242 --> 00:42:52,291
like, makes you more resourceful
and, like, you- you solve the

895
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:56,700
problems in a different way. And
I feel like, just -- I feel so

896
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,161
excited

896
00:42:57,161 --> 00:43:00,461
when I do it on my own. So, I
just, like, trying to build the

897
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:03,000
platforms, and giving the people
the encouragement, and, like,

899
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
the support to know that, like,
all of this stuff's possible.

901
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,481
Here- here's the way to get
started.

902
00:43:09,137 --> 00:43:09,766
Dan: That's awesome.

903
00:43:11,597 --> 00:43:14,177
Roger: Like I said, it causes-
causes everybody to just go down

904
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:16,487
that rabbit hole, and you start
thinking about these things, and

905
00:43:16,487 --> 00:43:19,700
you're just like, "Man, I don't
even know how to store p- you

907
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,500
know, flower for longer than a
couple of days." Like, "How am I

909
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,500
gonna store for years?" And
there- there different problems

910
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,766
you have to try to solve.

911
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:28,708
Dan: Yeah.

912
00:43:29,293 --> 00:43:33,300
Bekah: Yeah. I've -- I really
liked that idea about things get

913
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,784
done differently if it's out of
necessity. There's a very

914
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:42,700
different approach and a lot
of ... I don't know- I don't

915
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,482
know if I

916
00:43:43,483 --> 00:43:46,483
wanna say like innovation that
comes out of it, but, you know,

917
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:51,494
when you have to do something,
you're going to think about it

919
00:43:51,494 --> 00:43:55,300
in a different way. And you- and
you are going to change ...

920
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,284
things to make

920
00:43:57,284 --> 00:44:00,000
sure that it gets accomplished.
At -- that -- I feel --

921
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,700
[chuckles] in my mind, I'm
building, like, a scientific

921
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,353
trial on what that looks like,
you know? Like, "Let's make

922
00:44:05,353 --> 00:44:07,700
these people do it out of
necessity. And then, these

923
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,143
people can brainstorm." How does
that turn out?

924
00:44:12,534 --> 00:44:15,923
Dan: I -- yeah. But I mean, I
think that's a -- it's a really

925
00:44:15,923 --> 00:44:18,700
interesting point. And i-it's
one of the, like, sort of

926
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,043
through

926
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:21,233
lines of the way you've been
talking, you know? Especially

927
00:44:21,233 --> 00:44:23,244
about your career and, you know,
the choice you made, right? Is-

928
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:26,153
is that- is that doing by
necessity? And it's a much

929
00:44:26,153 --> 00:44:30,929
different ... learning path
than school, like a norm- like a

931
00:44:30,929 --> 00:44:33,539
sort of traditional school or
even a bootcamp, right, where

932
00:44:33,898 --> 00:44:38,000
you're learning because somebody
told you to learn this thing,

934
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,300
right? So, maybe somebody that
comes out of -- if there was

935
00:44:42,268 --> 00:44:42,268
some f-f-f- -- I don't

935
00:44:42,268 --> 00:44:44,000
know if there is these days
or not, a front-end development,

936
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,500
like, actual degree, these --
[chuckles] I -- who knows? But,

937
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,300
you know, like, somebody who
graduated school with that sort

938
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:54,000
of thing will have a ... sort of
a -- maybe a different knowledge

939
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
set than somebody who was
working for four years, right,

941
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
in- in that field. And there's
gonna be things that they do

942
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,252
know, that the other person

943
00:45:00,253 --> 00:45:05,000
doesn't, and vice versa, you
know? But that necessity ...

945
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
driving force is- is ... I don't
know. It's an important and

947
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,423
interesting- interesting thing.

948
00:45:10,623 --> 00:45:13,983
Roger: You know, absolutely.
And- and I started- I started in

950
00:45:13,983 --> 00:45:17,000
my call [??] career before I
feel, like, bootca- camps were a

951
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,273
thing. I- I tried

951
00:45:18,273 --> 00:45:22,923
going to school to learn IT. But
by that point, I understood more

952
00:45:23,103 --> 00:45:26,300
than they were trying to teach
me. And I- I couldn't -- it was-

953
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:30,784
it was- it was a difficult time.
And when I realized that I can

954
00:45:30,784 --> 00:45:35,000
just sort of get the job without
needing anything more than being

955
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,298
able to do it, like,

956
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:39,000
that just caused me just to,
"Oh, I'm gonna learn this. Okay.

957
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,700
Yeah, I can do that." And it
just, for me, it's

959
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,000
self-propelled. Because I always
had the tools to figure it out,

960
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,048
because that's how I started.

961
00:45:46,048 --> 00:45:49,000
I started, you know, not having
the luxury of being able to

962
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
search the internet for
something cuz I didn't have the

963
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,300
internet to search. I had

964
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,648
"HTML and CSS For Dummies". I
had to find it in that

965
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:01,009
book and you use that resource.
And so, going from that to- to

966
00:46:01,018 --> 00:46:04,688
now, like, and having to be able
to figure things out, out of

967
00:46:04,688 --> 00:46:07,300
necessity, because there are
people that couldn't work

969
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,000
because their technology wasn't working and you're responsible

970
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,659
to fix it, to

971
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,498
being like, "Okay. Now we have
these massive sets of problems.

972
00:46:14,498 --> 00:46:18,458
How can we resolve all of them
with automation? Or how can we

973
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:21,700
solve an unknown problem or
build new problems with code?"

974
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,858
And that's-

975
00:46:22,858 --> 00:46:27,000
that's kind of exciting because
like, for me, I never learned

977
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
the fundamentals like you would
in school. And, like, there's

978
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,700
great benefit to going through
because, like, different people

980
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:37,700
learn different ways. And I feel
like I had an understanding from

981
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,323
what I learned

982
00:46:38,324 --> 00:46:42,494
on how- how all the programming
language kind of overlapped. But

983
00:46:42,494 --> 00:46:44,500
when you're in school or you go
through bootcamp, you learn

984
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:44,982
those

985
00:46:44,983 --> 00:46:47,983
same things. You get that same
sense of encouragement that, you

986
00:46:47,983 --> 00:46:51,434
know, "I had to go through and
overcome kind of in the life- in

987
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:55,000
the life field, where there were
real consequences if things

988
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:55,454
didn't

988
00:46:55,454 --> 00:46:59,224
work out." But going through a
traditional or going through a

989
00:46:59,224 --> 00:47:02,463
school or a bootcamp, you know,
you get kind of battle-tested

990
00:47:02,494 --> 00:47:04,500
early on because they're
shifting you through all of

991
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,372
these ideas

992
00:47:05,373 --> 00:47:08,373
and concepts, and you learn
fundamentally how all these

993
00:47:08,373 --> 00:47:10,983
things work, which gives you
enough confidence to sort of

994
00:47:11,014 --> 00:47:14,500
jumpstart where you need to be.
Because you go from having no

995
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,000
idea how

995
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,853
any of this technology works,
to being like, "I know how magic

996
00:47:17,853 --> 00:47:21,500
works, and I will figure out how
to cast a spell. Dagnabbit."

997
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,583
And- and that in itself is
power.

998
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:26,700
Dan: It is power. It's awesome.
It's such a good feeling, right,

1000
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,000
whether -- it doesn't matter how
you- how you learn, like, that-

1001
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,243
that feeling of-

1002
00:47:30,804 --> 00:47:33,635
of knowing how to do the thing,
knowing how to cast the magic

1003
00:47:33,635 --> 00:47:34,894
spell. I lo- I- I love it.

1004
00:47:35,181 --> 00:47:38,000
Bekah: I's great. Well, Roger,
we're just about out of time.

1005
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,901
So I wanna

1006
00:47:38,902 --> 00:47:43,251
thank you for being here. Is
there any last bits of advice or

1007
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:45,282
things you want our listeners to
hear?

1008
00:47:47,362 --> 00:47:50,521
Roger: Ooh. I never -- I didn't
think about this. I should have

1009
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:54,700
come prepared. I- I just think,
like, i-if you're looking at

1010
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,700
something and you feel ... out
of place, or you feel like you

1011
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,941
can't do it, or you're

1012
00:47:59,942 --> 00:48:03,000
not good enough, or what have
you, like, don't feel

1013
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,700
discouraged. Because at some
point, everybody has been at

1014
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:10,300
that point [??], and has looked
through, and has gotten over it.

1015
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,072
And i-it's just a matter of you
getting to it. You just have to

1017
00:48:14,072 --> 00:48:18,032
do it. And then once you've done
it, it's easy. And I

1019
00:48:18,032 --> 00:48:21,061
try to avoid saying things are
easy because it wasn't easy for

1020
00:48:21,061 --> 00:48:25,500
me when I started. But once I
did it, it became easy. And so,

1021
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,300
just remembering, like, getting
over that first hurdle and

1022
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,500
having the confidence

1022
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,461
of doing the thing, doesn't
matter what that thing is,

1023
00:48:32,942 --> 00:48:35,500
eventually you're going to do
it. Doesn't matter how long you

1024
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,700
wait to do it. But you'll get
over that hurdle, and it's gonna

1025
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,500
get easier from there. Because
once you do it, you figured it

1026
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,000
out. You can't un-figure it out.
It only goes one direction. It's

1027
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,831
a one-way street. Once you start
walking it, that's it. You're

1028
00:48:49,831 --> 00:48:53,161
just gonna keep figuring things
out. And when you start- when

1029
00:48:53,251 --> 00:48:56,500
you start out, I feel like
everything is overwhelming and

1030
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:56,956
... you

1030
00:48:56,956 --> 00:49:00,226
know, there's just a lot of
information coming in. And when

1031
00:49:00,226 --> 00:49:02,657
you first sit down and you're
falling all of these, you know,

1032
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:04,800
tutorials like, "Hey, it works!"
But then, when you try to do it

1034
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,000
on your own and it doesn't,
that's frustrating. Cuz you're

1036
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
like, "I should be able to have
this thing do the thing." And

1038
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,700
it's not that you're ever wrong.
It's just that you have to take

1040
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,000
a little bit more time to figure
out which step that you missed

1041
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,466
in the

1042
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:18,706
process because it's somewhere.
And when you do it once, you can

1043
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,300
do it again. And once you've
done it a dozen times, suddenly

1044
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,000
they're calling you a senior
developer.

1044
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,181
And that's just how it goes. It
just takes time and

1045
00:49:26,181 --> 00:49:28,492
persistence. And eventually,
you'll overcome everything.

1046
00:49:30,431 --> 00:49:33,000
Bekah: Love that. It's a great
way to end. Thanks so much,

1047
