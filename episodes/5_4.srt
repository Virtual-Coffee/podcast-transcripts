00:00:03,883 --> 00:00:06,700
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello and
welcome to Season 5, Episode 4

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:12,000
of the Virtual Coffee podcast.
I'm Bekah. And this is a podcast

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,500
that features members of the
Virtual Coffee community.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
stages of their coding journey.
And they're here, on this

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,252
podcast, sharing their stories
and what they've learned. And

10
00:00:23,252 --> 00:00:27,200
we're here to share it with you.
Here with me today is my cohost,

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,602
Dan.

11
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:31,774
Dan Ott: Yo! What's up, Bekah!
Today, we talked with Yolanda

12
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:35,000
Haynes. Yolanda is a career
changer. She was previously

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
working in healthcare as a
certified occupational therapy

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,694
assistant and switched to doing
development. And so, we talked

15
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:46,500
about her decision-making
process through that, her

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,500
journey through, you know,
learning, learning on your own,

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:56,024
then some bootcamp stuff. She
did 100Devs and The Collab Lab,

19
00:00:56,054 --> 00:00:59,164
which I was like -- which she
shared a lot about. And it

20
00:00:59,164 --> 00:01:03,043
sounds like a very cool ...
experience for her. And ...

21
00:01:03,704 --> 00:01:05,054
yeah, I don't know. What else
did we talk about? [Chuckles]

22
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:10,500
Bekah: No. I love being able to
talk to her journey and ... hear

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,300
what she ... thinks,

24
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,700
like, in retrospect of that
journey. Because I -- there's-

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,000
Dan: Yeah.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,700
Bekah: -always that, "I wanna do
all of the things and try all

26
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,300
of the things. And everybody
else is going so fast, and I'm

27
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,000
going slow or not at the same
pace." And she talks about, you

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,700
know, the impacts of being a mom
on that. And so, it's really

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,000
great to hear those reflections
because I think they're super

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
insightful for anybody who's
learning anything, really.

32
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:41,000
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. No, I-
I- I love hearing about it too.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,500
And I always wonder, you know,
I- I started out doing all this

35
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,653
stuff long before there are any
bootcamps, you know, at all. I

36
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:51,043
always wonder ... how if, you
know, how- how things might've

37
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:54,554
been different if there -- that-
that was available at the time.

38
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:58,700
And now, there's of course too
many options [laughs]. But it's

40
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,700
like, swung the other way. But
it was- it was cool hearing it

42
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,000
from Yolanda. Cuz she's -- she
tried a few different -- or did

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,700
a few different things and I
think, it was pretty suc-

44
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,842
successful at all of them. And
--

45
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:11,500
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. She did
an excellent job, like,

47
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,000
piecemealing together a pretty
good educational path for

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
herself. And like you said, that
could be really hard. Cuz there-

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
there is so much out there and
you kind of have to wade through

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
a lot of different things to
figure out what works for you

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,098
and gets you where you need to
be.

54
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:31,954
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. Well, we
had a great time talking with

55
00:02:31,954 --> 00:02:34,593
Yolanda and I know you're going
to enjoy listen to it.

56
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:38,008
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast like we start every

57
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:41,038
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

58
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:44,300
we're from, what we do, and
random check-in question. We

60
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:54,500
hope you enjoy this episode.
Today's random check-in question

61
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,300
is, what's your go-to snack when
you don't feel like making a

62
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,000
full meal? So, my name is Bekah.
I am a technical community

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,500
builder from a small town in
Ohio. And for the last three

66
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,700
days, I've eaten chips and salsa
for almost every single meal.

68
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,146
So, that is, for sure, my- my
go-to answer here.

69
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:19,429
Dan: Chips and salsa always
good. Hi, I'm Dan. I do web

70
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:23,300
development from -- in
Cleveland, Ohio. And ... yeah,

72
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,468
I dunno. I- I- I think, in those
situations, I like to go the,

73
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:30,300
you know, lowest effort
possible. If I -- if there's,

74
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,500
like, apples in the fridge,
that's gonna be- that's gonna be

76
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,700
a big one, you know? I'm just,
like, kinda take it out and eat

77
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,000
it. Or a banana or something
like that, you know? If there's,

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,500
like, other snacks --

78
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,343
Bekah: You keep your apples in
the fridge? Are you supposed to

79
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:41,854
do that?

80
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,109
Dan: I think it keeps them
fresher long -- fresh longer

81
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:48,329
maybe? I- I don't know. I like
when they're cold. I don't-

83
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:55,300
I don't know why [laughs]. But
the -- I- I just always have --

84
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,508
I don't ... I don't know. Now-
now- now I don't know [laughs].

85
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:02,174
Bekah: I wasn't sure if I was
doing it wrong or-

86
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:03,000
Dan: I don't think there's,
like --

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Bekah: -just some preference.

87
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,700
Dan: I- I think it's just like
-- was like store-bought ones,

87
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,353
especially. It just keeps them
fresh longer. It,

89
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,788
like, you know, makes them last
longer. I think that's- I think

90
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:12,278
that's main -- the main thing.
There's nothing wrong.

91
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,913
Bekah: Well, like tomatoes, you
don't keep in the fridge. Cuz

92
00:04:13,913 --> 00:04:16,434
then they get grainy. But apples
don't, right?

93
00:04:17,487 --> 00:04:23,300
Dan: I- I don't know [Dan and
Bekah laugh]. That's it. That's

94
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,000
all I got. I- I -- my- my cold
apples, that's my snack

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,156
[laughs].

95
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:31,700
Yolanda Haynes: Well, hello. My
name is Yolanda. I'm from San

96
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,000
Diego, California, and my role
is a junior software engineer.

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,500
My go-to snack, it's -- or easy meal. So, there's this Japanese

98
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,000
thing called Ochazuke. And
that's the- the easiest meal I

99
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,547
can make. It's

99
00:04:43,547 --> 00:04:48,197
rice, hot water, and there's
like a packet of ... flavor. And

100
00:04:48,197 --> 00:04:51,391
then you just kind of pour hot
water over that packet of flavor

101
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,601
and rice. And that is like the
easiest meal. It's not really a

102
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:57,391
snack. But it's my go-to when I
don't feel like cooking at all.

103
00:04:57,632 --> 00:05:00,062
The rice keeps me full. And it's
just, like, this hot water, it's

104
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:04,000
just a ... a blend of happiness [laughs].

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,300
Bekah: Mm.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yolanda: So, that- that is kind
of my go-to easy meal slash

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,300
snack. But I did not know you
weren't supposed to put tomatoes

106
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,822
in the fridge. Cuz I do it
[chuckles].

107
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:19,877
Bekah: I've heard that it makes
some grainy [laughs].

108
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:25,406
Yolanda: But I keep my apples on
the counter. So, I don't know.

109
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:28,500
Bekah: Tomatoes go really bad
fast too if you keep them on

111
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,500
the counter. So you just have to
eat them really quickly. I feel

112
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,000
like --

112
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:33,346
Yolanda: [Whispers] Got it.

113
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:38,581
Bekah: I don't know. I -- one
of my favorite things I've done

114
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:41,401
in the last year, I always saw,
like, you could buy packet of

115
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:44,672
rice that you heat up in the
microwave. It's like 90 seconds.

116
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:46,700
And I'm like, "It doesn't even
take that long to make rice. Why

118
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,802
would you do that?" And now, I
have like a cupboard stash full

119
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:52,562
of [chuckles] 90-second rice.
Cuz it's so easy [laughs].

120
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:55,700
Yolanda: Is it- is it good? I-
I- I don't think I've tried

121
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,146
that.

121
00:05:56,716 --> 00:06:01,000
Bekah: It's decent. I like to
buy the jasmine rice. And

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,906
that -- I

123
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:05,567
feel like it's probably better
than what I make on the stove

124
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,300
top, because I normally forget
that I'm making rice. And then

126
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,300
I'm, like, also way more likely
to burn it. So [chuckles] you

127
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,126
cannot -- well, as far

128
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:15,076
as I know, you can't burn it in
the microwave. I could probably

129
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:16,156
find a way to do that too
though [chuckles].

130
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:19,737
Yolanda: I guess it's opposite
for me. Asian household. So I

131
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:23,000
have a rice cooker. And it's
always ... there's always rice.

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,461
There's never a time [inaudible]
isn't rice.

132
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:29,700
So, it's just ... I- I don't
think I've ever burnt rice. Cuz

133
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,192
rice cooker kind of -- it's easy
peasy just to kind [inaudible].

134
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:34,511
Bekah: Oh, I think I burnt it in
the rice cooker before [Yolanda

136
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:35,562
gasps]. I think I had to throw
away my rice cooker [laughs].

137
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:41,637
Dan: [Laughs] Yeah. Should've
put it in the fridge.

138
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:48,766
Bekah: Well, this is not a
podcast about all of the ways

139
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:53,357
I've ruined food. So, we will go
ahead and talk about what we're

140
00:06:53,357 --> 00:06:56,956
really here to talk about. And
that is Yolanda. So, we're so

142
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:59,836
happy to have you here with us,
and we always like to start off

143
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:03,797
with your origin story. So, you
know, where are you from and how

144
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:06,797
have you gotten to this point in
your tech journey?

145
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:11,437
Yolanda: Oof, good question. Let
me try to make it short. I don't

146
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:16,205
want to take too much of the
time. So, I born and raised in

148
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:21,062
San Diego. I've -- I'm a career
changer. So I used to work in

149
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:25,052
healthcare before I became a
software engineer. But my start

150
00:07:25,052 --> 00:07:30,331
off the journey was probably my
first ... PC — family PC. I

151
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:37,000
wanna say it was a Windows 3.1
— was the OS. And I thought I

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,177
was a bad-ass

153
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:42,257
by taking apart my family
computer. And, you know, just

154
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:45,497
saying, "Oh, okay. This is- this
is what the inside of the

155
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:48,916
computer looks like." You know-
you know, I unplug everything.

156
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,706
I think it's called like a VGA
cable, the HDMI -- I don't even

157
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:54,500
think there was HDMI back then.
But just all the cables,

158
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,887
and then open up the family
computer, and- and was just try

159
00:07:57,887 --> 00:08:01,141
to take out some stuff, and- and
then I'm like, "Okay, let me put

161
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:03,000
it back together." And I
thought, "Oh, I'm a hacker now."

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,052
Like, "I can- I can do this."
[Laughs] So that was probably my

165
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:11,041
first taste of tech, was kind of
doing that. And then --

166
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,687
Bekah: So, you did put it back
successfully though? Cuz I was

167
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:15,096
waiting for, "And then it didn't
work."

168
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,812
Yolanda: I mean, yeah. I don't
remember getting in trouble or

169
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:21,300
anything breaking. I think,
literally, it was just

170
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,052
unplugging

170
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:28,531
everything, opening the computer
case, and maybe take out a RAM?

171
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:32,251
I- I am not quite sure. And
then, just kind of, you know,

172
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:36,000
put everything together, and
then turn on the computer, and

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
it worked as if nothing
happened. So --

175
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,500
Bekah: Nice.

176
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,500
Yolanda: Yeah. That was kind of
-- I was very curious, and I

175
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,000
like to work with my hands
[chuckles]. So, that was -- that

176
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,966
kept me busy. And then, I played
a lot of those free games that

177
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:54,136
came with the computer. So, I
think Space Cadet was the one --

178
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:57,100
it's like a pinball machine. And
there was like a -- it- it came

179
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,616
with a

179
00:08:57,616 --> 00:09:01,096
computer free trial or whatever,
and we didn't, you know, buy

180
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:04,876
games. So that was play the same
pinball machine over and over

181
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:09,557
again. And then, I started
learning how to type was in

182
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:13,216
middle school cuz they had those
typing program classes. So,

183
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:17,236
I really enjoyed that, got a
really good knack at that. And

184
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:21,677
then high school, I started
messing around with trying

185
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:24,767
to fix other people's computer.
I was helping out a neighbor

186
00:09:24,886 --> 00:09:26,686
messing with their BIOS cuz they
had ... at that time was Windows

188
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:31,500
Vista, and she just had some
difficulties with that. And

189
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:31,995
then --

190
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:36,812
but I had to had my now husband
— back then was my boyfriend's

191
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:41,500
— help, cuz he was also into
tech. So, college, I was

192
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,500
thinking of doing computer
science. So I took a Comp Sci

193
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,000
101 class. And then, I had a
friend [chuckles], I --

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and they told me like, "Oh,
yeah. You gotta be really

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
smart and really good to find a
job in this field." And at that

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,062
time, oof, this was over- over
15 years ago. We didn't have the

199
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:03,991
nice GUIs that we have today. So
when you, you know, try to — I

200
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:06,751
think it was Java — and compile
it, it gives you an error. And

201
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:09,300
it says, "Oh, between lines this
and that." But there's no red

203
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,300
squiggly lines. It was just,
like, find what's wrong with it.

205
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,500
And I would spent hours just
trying to find what I missed.

206
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,500
And there'll be a misspelling,
or a semi-colon, you know,

208
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,000
something- something basic. But
I wrote the code, so I didn't

209
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,500
see it, you know? When I asked
my friend, you know, they'll see

210
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,361 
it. And they're like, "Oh, yeah.
It's- it's-

212
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:30,721
it's right there. And I'm like,
"Oh, thanks." But he's like,

213
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:33,000
"Yeah. If you wanna find a job
in this field, you gotta be,

214
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
like, really smart." And I'm
like, "Oh, that's- that's-

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,500
that's not me." So, I- I ...
sticked with my original major,

217
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,450
which- which was Japanese,

218
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:45,751
cuz I was thinking of going to
the linguistics route then. And

219
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:48,481
so I graduated with that, with a
minor in media arts and

220
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:53,000
technology, cuz I still wanted
some sort of tech ... learning.

221
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,511
So that's what I did. Then I

223
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:58,907
went abroad, worked and taught English in Japan for

225
00:10:58,907 --> 00:11:02,386
about two years, and then came
back, and thought, "Oh, what am

226
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:05,866
I gonna do?" Then I did
occupational therapy assistant

227
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,500
route. So I was in that field
for about five to six years.

229
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,300
Then COVID hit, lost my hours,
then I learned how to code. So,

230
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,596
that's where I started my coding
journey, October of 2020. Then I

231
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:22,000
found a job, December of 2021.
So, kind of took a little over a

233
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,817
year. And here I am, with you
guys, today [laughs].

234
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:29,500
Bekah: [Chuckles] That's
awesome. You have like a couple

235
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,777
career pivots, right?

235
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:35,636
Because your major is Japanese
in Utah, and then you did the

236
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:39,746
occupational therapy route, and
then, came over to tech.

237
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:43,076
Yolanda: Yes. It was a windy,
windy journey. I mean, I had

238
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:46,256
other jobs. I think I was an
afterschool program aid. Then I

239
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:49,376
was a dance instructor in
between, so I- I did a lot of

240
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,700
odd jobs here and there ...
before ... right here ... where

241
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,366
I am today.

241
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:58,682
Bekah: That's awesome. And I
know as you're learning, I wanna

242
00:11:58,682 --> 00:12:00,902
talk about your learning
journey, cuz I think that you've

243
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:05,072
done a lot of cool things. And
in- in somewhere along the line,

244
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:10,142
you also had a kid. And so, that
impacts your journey too. So,

245
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:13,000
let's maybe not talk about the
kid yet, and [Yolanda chuckles]

246
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
talk about, you know, what- what organizations -- or- or what ...

247
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,496
like ... things did

248
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:28,147
you do to help you stay on track
with learning how to code?

249
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:33,800
Yolanda: Hmm. Good question. I
think -- so I tried -- a couple

250
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,961
of times trying to learn how to
code. I definitely bought a

251
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:40,681
Udemy course, and it was, like,
"Here's how to build your first

253
00:12:40,682 --> 00:12:43,700
website or a complete website."
So I did that from start to

255
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,500
finish, and then thinking, "Oh,
okay. That's it?" I think that

256
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,042
was, like,

256
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:53,072
2015, or later, or earlier, or,
yeah. Sorry, my time's off. But

257
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:59,447
-- so, I did that. And then,
nothing came about. And then, I

258
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:03,300
wanted to do a career change
with another friend who was

259
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,000
also a COTA [Certified
Occupational Therapy Assistant].

260
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,386
And we were like, "Oh, we need
to figure out, like, how are

262
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:10,300
we gonna -- what's the, you
know, the end goal?" Cuz we

264
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,817
can't keep transferring patients
in our 60s or 70s. I mean,

265
00:13:13,817 --> 00:13:16,700
technically we can. But it's not
best on our body. So, we were

266
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,500
like, "Okay, maybe we should,
like, really focus on learning

268
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,000
how to code." So we tried the
Odin project.

269
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,500
Bekah: Mm.

270
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,700 
Yolanda: And then, [laughs] I
tried that. And then, she had

269
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:27,500
some -- she had to deal with
some, you know, family stuff.

270
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
So, she had to put that on
pause, and I was by myself

271
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,700
again. I'm like, "Oh, okay." So,
that didn't ... happen. And

272
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,700
then, I found a 100Devs Leon's
class, and it was like a free

273
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,000
bootcamp. My husband found it,
like, I think, through Reddit.

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,700
And I thought, "Oh, okay. Well,
it's free. I lost my hours

276
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,500
during this pandemic in 2020.
It wouldn't hurt." So, that's

277
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,000
how I started really focusing on
learning how to code because the

278
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,500
community was just there. There
was a lot of people I could just

280
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,000
kind of rely on and have that

281
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
accountability. So I did that,
while doing part-time work,

282
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,451
while taking care of the kid.
And just being in that community

283
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:10,802
was helpful. And then, during
that commun- learning, I -- my

284
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:13,500
teacher, or Leon, said like,
"Oh, networking is very

286
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,000
important. And then, I found
Virtual Coffee -- no, I found

287
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,700
somebody posted, say, "Hey, you
should check out Virtual

288
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,300
Coffee." And that was, like, 
November of 2020. And, yeah. And

289
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,272
then, I just kind of ...

290
00:14:24,902 --> 00:14:28,846
listened to all the devs in
there, you know, or people in

291
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:32,687
tech, their journey, how they
studied or, you know, their

292
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:35,576
explanation of things. And that
was helpful. So I kind of tried

293
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:42,000
to combine listening to that,
doing Leon's class, and, of

295
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,471
course, doing outside stuff like
the freeCodeCamp. I dabbled into

297
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:48,700
it a little bit, trying to
solidify those basic

298
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,000
foundations. And there are other
free courses. I think there's,

298
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,300
like, Scrimba that I probably,
you know, dabbled in. So, here

299
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,000
and there. But I definitely was
one of those people that ...

301
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,187
bite off way more than I can
chew. So [laughs], I think

302
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:05,300
it's the fear of missing out.
That was like the- the number

304
00:15:05,300--> 00:15:07,500
one thing. Like, "I gotta do
them all."

305
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Bekah: Mm, yeah.

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,500
Yolanda: "I have to. If I don't,
I'm not gonna get it."

305
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,300
So, Leon's class, freeCodeCamp,
Scrimba, alrite. Networking,

306
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,500
Virtual Coffee, you know, these
other communities. I got to do

307
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,000
them all because if I don't, you
know, I'm not gonna be

309
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,500
successful. And, yeah
[chuckles]. Definitely burnt out

310
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,636
here and there throughout the
journey.

311
00:15:27,062 --> 00:15:30,932
Bekah: Can you tell us a
little bit more about Learn With

312
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:36,032
Leon? We've had a- a big influx
of 100Devs. And I think somebody

313
00:15:36,032 --> 00:15:41,701
told us that ... his post about
100Devs was one of the top two

315
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:46,231
most viewed posts on Reddit or
something like that. So, it's

316
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:51,511
really taken off recently. But
I've heard a lot of positive

317
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:55,000
experiences from there. And I'm
just curious, like, how things

319
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,711
work with that.

320
00:15:56,422 --> 00:16:00,711
Yolanda: Yeah. I -- this year
is just crazy amount of people

321
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:05,300
who joined. I think, the first
session Leon had, like, 7000

322
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,300
views on his Twitch. And that
is-

323
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,000
Bekah: Wow.

323
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,321
Yolanda: -that was just crazy.
When I started,

324
00:16:10,741 --> 00:16:17,131
I wanna say we had about 3000 at
the start? Maybe two? And

325
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:20,822
that- and that was, like, his
somewhat first time of doing it.

326
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:24,001
I think you had a five week of
course, prior to doing the

327
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:28,351
100Devs. But when he did the
official 100Devs in October

329
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:31,922
of 2020, I think there was about
two, maybe 3000 of us. One

330
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:35,611
guy, Leon, does live Twitch
streaming twice a week for three

331
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:38,522
hours, and then, he has office
hours for three hours. And then,

332
00:16:38,522 --> 00:16:41,000
we just kind of go -- he does
live coding, and then we follow

334
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,700
along, and then he assigns
homework. So, the experience,

335
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,000
this is my first bootcamp.

336
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So there's nothing much for me
to base or compare it to.

337
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,576
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

338
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:55,000
Yolanda: And I've tried to learn
how to code on my own, and I

339
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,700
failed miserably [laughs]. So,
yeah. Leon's class helped me, at

341
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,000
least solidify that foundation
and allowed me to kind of expand

342
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,162
my skill sets through that. So,
I liked it because it helped me

343
00:17:13,592 --> 00:17:17,500
... [sighs] stay focused, I
guess, is -- and- and not do too

344
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,000
many things at once. So, I
thought, "Okay, Leon's class.

344
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,700
Let me just commit this. Class
is Tuesday, Thursday. I have to

345
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,500
be on class." So, I would change
my work schedule to make sure I

346
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,300 
make it to those class. Because
I'm one of those people, if I

348
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,000
miss a class, I- I don't know if
I have enough time to play catch

349
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
up. So, if I ... make it -- if
I'm sex- sussex- successful --

350
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,500
oh, I can't even say this word
[Bekah and Dan chuckle] is --

350
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,300
then, you know, if I'm at that
class, I -- I'm there. I'm gonna

351
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,000
learn. And the chances of me to
be ... to find a job in the end

353
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
will help me, then I- I will do
whatever I can. So, you know,

355
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,500
I talk to my husband, and say,
"Hey, can you watch the little

356
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,041
one?" Okay. Talk to all my
patients, "Hey, I'm -- this

358
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:05,300
block, I can't see you because
I'm busy." So -- and it was

359
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,000
helpful for -- to establish
that. And then, I relied on that

360
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,500
Discord community. Because when
I have questions about homework,

361
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,500
I'll reach out, say, "Hey, I
don't get it. I don't understand

362
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,000
JavaScript. I don't -- it
doesn't make any sense to me,"

363
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,500
you know? And then, going
through Virtual Coffee, I was

364
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,300
like, "I s- I don't get
JavaScript.

364
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,166
I -- am I ever gonna get it?"
Like, "I -- how do you guys

365
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,406
get it?" And it's -- it was very
comforting to hear stories, you

366
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:34,300
know? People would say, "Yeah,
it- it sucks at first. It- it's

367
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,000
gonna click. It's going to take
some time. Don't worry about

368
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
it." Or, "Hey, try these
resources. It might click seeing

369
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,300
it this way." So ... I hope that
answered your question. I think

371
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,257
I- I went -- I deviated. I'm
sorry.

372
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:48,017
Bekah: No. That was great.

373
00:18:49,537 --> 00:18:54,000
Dan: We're all about mean-
meandering topics here [laughs].

375
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,346
It's- it's the best way to --
it's the best way to be.

376
00:18:58,007 --> 00:19:01,300
Bekah: Were- were the hours --
the office hours live stream

377
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:01,636
too?

377
00:19:01,902 --> 00:19:06,000
Yolanda: Yes. So, he was live
... originally, it was- it was

378
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,300
on Saturdays. And then, he
switched it to Sundays for three

379
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,300
hours. So, I think, in the beginning, it was like homework

381
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,500
review. And then, it became more
of just, "Hey, if you have

382
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,700
questions, I'll answer it." So,
he'll open up and there'll be

382
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,051
like a flood gates of questions.

383
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:25,112
And he'll- he'll answer it live.
So, sometimes, it'll be about

384
00:19:25,112 --> 00:19:30,092
the homework. Sometimes, it'll
just be about the dev journey,

386
00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:33,300
or, you know, s-s- about not
understanding the syntax of

388
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,500
something. And he'll go over it.
Or he'll try to show it in a

389
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,500
different way. So, for me, that
was helpful because it just kind

390
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:48,600
of ... that review was- was
nice. So, I liked it. It was

391
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:48,961
helpful.

392
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:52,000
Dan: That's- that's really cool.
I- I mean, that's a- a pretty

393
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,700
interesting, and I think, pretty
unique ... approach. And it

394
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,001
sounds -- well, I mean, a lot of
people seem pretty into it. So

395
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:00,000
... it's cool.

396
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,000
Yolanda: Yeah. It's -- I think
it's cool.

397
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,300
Dan: Mm.

398
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Yolanda: Just a lot of work.
Because it's ... you have to put

397
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,500
in the effort. I -- like I said,
I don't have any other bootcamp

398
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,500
experience. So, this is, like,
really relying on yourself and

399
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,000
others.

400
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,500
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

401
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,500
Yolanda: And from -- I guess
what I've heard what other

400
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,000
people who's been through
bootcamp, and physically been

401
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
through bootcamp, there's this
kind of nice face-to-face,

403
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,800
you know? You could directly ask
the teacher exactly at that

405
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,751
moment when you have, you know,
questions. And the

406
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:32,721
accountability, I have a feeling
is much higher doing in-person

407
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:36,832
bootcamp. And then, also, you
pay. So, you really want to make

408
00:20:36,832 --> 00:20:41,000
sure that you complete this
bootcamp. While this was free,

410
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,500
but it kinda give you that ...
if you have other priorities, you

411
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,700
don't feel like you have to pick
one or the other. You could

413
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,700
always try to play catch up. And
there's no money lost, only

414
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:56,700
time. Which is ... not a bad
thing [chuckles]. But I like it.

415
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,700
It was enjoyable. And I'm
helping out right now as a mod

416
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,886
[moderator]. So, trying to give
back-

417
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:04,700
Dan: Oh, nice. That's nice.
Well, that's cool.

418
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,166
Yolanda: -with what I can.

419
00:21:05,596 --> 00:21:09,500
Dan: That's really cool. I --
and I- I -- you said something

420
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,500
about ... you know, when you --
when- when you first started

421
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,500
this, how- how it helped you,
you know, sort of focus your

422
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,300
learning energy, or [laughs] you
know, like, kind of direct it.

423
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,800
And I think that's a -- I think
that's something I wanted to

424
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,000
call it too, is it's- it's an
important thing to do. And it-

425
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,911
and it's one of the -- when
people are talking about

427
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,682
learning, you know, and they're-
and they're just starting out,

428
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:32,551
it's- it's one of the biggest
reasons for- for- for doing some

429
00:21:32,551 --> 00:21:35,622
sort of class, something
structured. A bootcamp, or a- a

430
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:39,872
course, or- or the 100Devs, you
know, style or whatever. But

431
00:21:40,442 --> 00:21:43,500
there is -- our -- there's just
so much that you could learn,

432
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,300
right? [Chuckles] And it's
almost impossible to just, on

433
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
your own, when you- when you
don't know anything to start.

434
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:54,000
It's almost impossible to 
self-direct yourself through ...

435
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,500
without- without a plan, you
know what I mean?

436
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,000
Yolanda: [Whispers] Right.

436
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:59,747
Dan: So, we've -- I've- I've-
I've heard other stories,

437
00:21:59,747 --> 00:22:02,477
you know, it's kinda similar
experiences of, you know, being

438
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:05,300
like, just going all over the
place [chuckles], stuff- stuff

439
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,500
getting overloaded, right? And
then ... yeah. And then- and

440
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
then, like, something like a
course or whatever will- will

441
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,000
just, like, help you kind of
narrow it down. I think, it's

442
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,700
important. I'm- I'm glad it
obviously worked out --

443
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,477
[chuckles] worked well for you.

443
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:18,000
Yolanda: It did.

444
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Dan: It's cool. Yeah.

445
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,000
Yolanda: [Chuckles] It did. I
had to, like, think about it

445
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,600
too. I was like, "What's the
best way to describe this, you

446
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,500
know, feeling and experience?"
And I -- and the best one I

448
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,000
could think of is, you know,
when you go into, like, an

449
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,700
all-you-can-eat sushi bar, or
like, you know, a buffet, and

450
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,500
you are just overwhelmed with
this plethora of, like, food.

451
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,700
And you're like, "Where do I
start? I'm gonna eat it all."

452
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,500
And that's what I feel like
[laughs] when this is -- the

454
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
starting of the coding journey.
It's like -- people was like,

455
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,000
"Oh, you gotta learn -- you
should learn Python. You

456
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,700
should learn j- excuse me, Java,
JavaScript, HTML, CSS. And

457
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,000
you're like, "Okay, sure." So,
I'm, like, going down the buffet

459
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
line and just grabbing different
stuffs [laughs]. And that's-

461
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
that's how it felt, like, in the
beginning. I was like, "Okay, I

463
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,700
should grab them all. I need to
grab them all. If I don't, I'm

464
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,801
gonna miss out. And if I miss
out, I'm gonna miss, you know, I

465
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:10,300
won't know the taste of this 
delicious food." And I feel

466
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,000
like, that's how it was in the
beginning, before I finally

467
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,250
slowed down to one plate
[Yolanda and Dan chuckle].

468
00:23:15,951 --> 00:23:18,771
Bekah: I love it. That's such a
great analogy. And people often

469
00:23:18,771 --> 00:23:22,500
ask too, like, "Well, what are
you interested in doing?" And-

471
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
and kind of like you're saying,
like, well, you haven't had a

473
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,800
taste of everything. So if you
are -- wanna know what you're

474
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:30,000
interested in, then I guess you
should probably sample all of

475
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,300
the things, you know? Which is
really not ... probably, like,

476
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,000
it's -- I think, it's really
hard to know what you're

477
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,231
interested in, until you really
have tried it for awhile.

478
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yolanda: That's true. It's like
asking a kid, "What do you wanna

479
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
be when you grew up?"

479
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,700
I mean, they could answer. But
it's always changing. And ...

480
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,342
I don't know. If I were a kid, I
feel like, for me at least, it's

481
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:53,000
like, "I wanna do -- I wanna be
a pediatrician. No, I like

482
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,500
animals. I wanna be a
vegetarian." It was just like

483
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,000
... I don't know what I really
wanna do. I still don't know.

484
00:23:58,592 --> 00:24:01,000
Bekah: My daughter once said,
she was like, "I either want to

485
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
be a princess, a cat, or a
doctor." And I was like,

487
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
"Alrite. Well, that seems pretty
easy, doctor." [Laughs]

488
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,300
Dan: [Chuckles] Go for- go for-
go for cat. Cat seems like a

489
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,500
really good life [chuckles]. If-
if you, I mean, if you have a

490
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,000
good home anyway. I feel like if
you're a cat, you have it set,

491
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
right? [Laughs] Yeah. No, that's
a great point. And you know

493
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,500
what? Honestly, it- it -- so,
when- when you were talking

494
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,000
about you're -- you were in
college and the intro to CS

496
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
class, and sort of made that
choice to, you know, that's an

497
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,707
experience a lot of

498
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:35,700
people have too. And, like,
you're talking about what do you

500
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,500
wanna be when you grow up when
you're a kid, but that question,

502
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,000
like, hangs around forever, you
know? There's not like a- a

503
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,116
thing, and that -- there's

504
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,727
not a point where that can, you
know ... maybe you've found

505
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:50,000
something that you're fine with
or whatever, but it's always as

507
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
we've approved [chuckles]
possible to change, right? But

508
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,700
that experience of, like, going
into freshman year is ... so

509
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:03,500
fraught, that sort of stuff, you
know? And ... those, like, it's

511
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,817
funny how those- those -- I- I
just keep thinking about your-

513
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:08,007
your friend telling you that you
had to be smart to do this or

514
00:25:08,247 --> 00:25:10,467
whatever. And you know, when
you're a- a freshman and

515
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,257
everything's overwhelming. And I
feel like you're still probably,

516
00:25:13,257 --> 00:25:15,000
like, trying to take stuff off
of the buffet. It's just a

518
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,500
different buffet, right?
[Laughs] And ... how- how,

519
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,500
like, one- one sentence, like
that can- can change, like,

520
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,000
what you, you know, your whole
... life, really, you know?

522
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Like, I don't really have a
point [laughs] other than I was

523
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,106
just -- I just keep thinking
about, you know, I just keep

525
00:25:30,106 --> 00:25:32,000
coming back to that. Cuz I --
I've had -- I mean, I had

526
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,500
experiences like that in college
too, you know? And I changed

527
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,300
majors a few times and ... all
of that stuff, including being

528
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,300
in computer science major, and I
changed to English instead of

529
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,000
Japanese. So, it was- it was a
little- a little easier for me

530
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,800
[laughs]. Although, you know,
now that I think of it, I was

531
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,500
signed up for a Japanese class,
like, first semester of freshman

533
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,700
year and ... well, I didn't- I 
didn't -- I dropped that- that

534
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,000
class very quickly because
[laughs] it was -- it didn't

535
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,700
well -- it didn't work out well
for me. But I feel like it

536
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,000
might've been early in the
morning too? I don't know. It

538
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
wasn't the right fit [laughs]
for me.

539
00:26:04,592 --> 00:26:07,531
Yolanda: Morning classes are
hard, regardless of the subject.

540
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:12,781
Dan: I'm trying to find, like,
a point of what I was saying.

542
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:15,000
I don't really have a point
other than I was affected by

544
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
that -- by- by your story. And
it- it's just, like, an

546
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,761
interesting thing to think
about.

547
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:20,700
Bekah: But it's -- it is true.
I mean, the things that you say

548
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,500
to other people matter. And it
might be an off the cuff thing.

550
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,700
But, you know, we- we talked
about this in Virtual Coffee.

551
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,000
Like, the- the impact of your
words does matter. And I

553
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,500
remember I had a student. My
first or second semester

554
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,000
teaching freshman English. And I
always tried to write something

555
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,000
positive on everybody's paper.
And he ... I think, was ...

556
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,531
taking this course for -- this
was not his first time

557
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:52,981
taking the course. And he came
up to me after the class and he

558
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:57,241
said, thank you so much for
saying whatever nice thing I've

559
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:00,300
said. He was like, "I have never
had any teacher say anything

561
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,500
nice about my writing. It's
always been, you know, red marks

562
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:09,000
or negative comments." And it --
that kind of thing just made

563
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,300
such a huge impression. Because,
you know, one- one small remark,

564
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,000
and it made a total difference
in-

565
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,500
in all the- the way that he
communicated and his investment

566
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,326
in the class. And I think that
positive or negative, that's-

567
00:27:23,326 --> 00:27:26,000
that's what it does. And, you
know, unfortunately I think

569
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,596
women have experienced a lot of
negativity and gatekeeping in

570
00:27:31,747 --> 00:27:36,606
more scientific or technical
fields — at least many stories

572
00:27:36,606 --> 00:27:40,700
that I've heard. So, it's
definitely something that- that

574
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,000
I hope gets better. And I
appreciate people telling

576
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
stories about that. So we're
aware of that kind of thing. So,

577
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,500
100Devs isn't the only program
you did, right? You -- did you

578
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,747
also do Collab Lab?

579
00:27:57,041 --> 00:28:02,261
Yolanda: I did. Yes. So I was in
Collab Lab summer of last year

580
00:28:02,471 --> 00:28:05,711
from July to August? June to
August? Something like that. So,

581
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:10,271
yeah. Another community I am
happy to be in and help out. So

582
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:14,922
love that- love that ... team,
people ... everyone [chuckles].

583
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:18,000
Bekah: Do you wanna talk a
little bit about what they're --

584
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,011
The Collab Lab does?

584
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:25,132
Yolanda: Yeah. Oh, I hope I do
... justice. It's an awesome,

585
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:30,000
awesome group -- or
organization, where they help 

586
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,300
... people who are new to the industry and teach them how to

587
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:39,500
collaborate in a team on a
project. So, you are given a ...

588
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,700
you are -- actually, you- you
have to apply to- to join Collab

589
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,300
Lab. And once they accept your
application, then you are put in

590
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,700
the team of four new developers,
and then about two to three

591
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:55,000
mentors. And then, it's a eight
week, I think ... process or

592
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,131
journey, where you create a
React app. It's like

594
00:28:59,132 --> 00:29:01,951
a shopping cart. Everybody does
the same thing. It's the same

595
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:05,432
application throughout other
teams. And then, from start to

596
00:29:05,432 --> 00:29:09,031
finish, you build your- your
application. So -- and then, it

597
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:14,041
just kind of ... every week, we
go through kind of what we've

598
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:19,000
learned ... ooh, hold on. Sorry.
Let me try to think what else.

599
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,796
And then, every week, you are
paired up with another dev. So,

601
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:28,547
it's like you, plus another dev.
And you work on this small task

602
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:31,500
that's been given to you. And we
go through, like, the GitHub

604
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,096
repo. You're assigned the task,
and then, there's, like,

606
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:38,300
acceptance criteria. So they try
to mimic a real life's work

607
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,000
scenario. So, in that week time
span, we have to try to complete

608
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
that task and push it, so the
mentors could take a look at the

609
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
-- do a code review. And then,
we also do a code review of our

610
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,500
partners or the other teams ...
code. And then, they teach us,

611
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,700
like, how to do a proper code
review. You can't just say,

612
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,000
"Everything looks good. Thumbs
up," you know? Try to give a

614
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,481
better feedback. Like, "Oh, what
does this do?" Or, "I don't

615
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,000
understand this. Can you explain
it better," type of comments.

616
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,600
And then, if it looks good, then
the mentor will give, like, a

617
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,500
thumbs up kinda thing, and then,
we push it to- to that main

618
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,415
branch. And do -- and then you
-- the second week, you get

620
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:22,207
paired with a different dev. So
it gives you that collaboration

621
00:30:22,207 --> 00:30:25,300
and getting used to working
with- with different people.

623
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,096
So, the team I'm on -- was on,
was a fantastic team. I wasn't

624
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:33,037
strong in React, so they
definitely helped me get a --

625
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:36,336
gain a better understanding and
kind of teach me through it.

626
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:40,267
And I just learned what AC was,
which was Acceptance Criteria,

627
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:44,346
you know? And then, when you
do the GitHub, there's like a

628
00:30:44,346 --> 00:30:50,000
template, and then, try to give
it that nice structure of when-

630
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,500
when you commit the code. So,
it's not just code. You're

631
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,000
explaining exactly what you're committing, you know, instead of

632
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,500
trying to have the other people guess what you're committing.

633
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,700
So, that was really nice. And
then, they talked about

634
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,500
accessibility. And ... it- it
was -- it's -- it was an awesome

636
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,500
program. I hope I did it
justice. I'm like -- it was like

637
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,000
a really-

637
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,000
Bekah: Well, we --

637
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Yolanda: -terrible explanation
[chuckles].

637
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:12,317
Bekah: No, I think you did a
really good job. And we'll have

638
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:16,300
a link to it so everybody can
check it out afterwards. We've

640
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,666
had a lot of Virtual Coffee
members go through Collab Lab.

641
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:23,700
And I really appreciate that ...
the collaboration that's focused

642
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:30,196
on. Because I -- my bootcamp
experiences similar issuers [??]

643
00:31:30,196 --> 00:31:34,307
in that. It was like self-paced.
I was- I was really by

644
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:39,886
myself. There wasn't a lot of,
like, one-on-one meetings, or

646
00:31:39,886 --> 00:31:44,000
... any collaboration happening,
which it's -- and made it doable

647
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,642
for me at the time. But like, in
retrospect, I feel like I needed

648
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:53,031
to make more of an effort to do
those types of collaboration,

649
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:56,500
because then, it was, like, kind
of a learning curve to figure

650
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,201
out how to communicate about
things and when to communicate

651
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:06,000
about things. So, did you feel
like that collaboration -- what-

652
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,797
what was the

653
00:32:06,797 --> 00:32:11,537
learning curve from where you
were when you started to

654
00:32:11,686 --> 00:32:15,856
have those good quality
collaborative meetings?

655
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:22,227
Yolanda: Ooh, good question.
I- I was going to apply ... I

656
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:25,700
think it was their ... spring
cohort? The beginning of the

657
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,582
year. And I

657
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:29,852
think that was after a month of
just learning JavaScript. I

658
00:32:29,852 --> 00:32:33,152
reached out to another Virtual
Coffee member, and ...

659
00:32:33,332 --> 00:32:36,872
either she applied or she just
went through it. And she told

661
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:41,000
me, "Hey," like, "Try the next
one. Because you should have

663
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,500
some sort of a good foundation
before. Cuz they -- Collab Lab

664
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,000
does not teach you how to code.
It just teaches you-

665
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,500
Bekah: Mm-hmm. 

666
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,237
Yolanda: -how to collaborate.

665
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:53,396
So having that coding foundation
is- is vital." So then, I

666
00:32:53,396 --> 00:32:56,846
pushed it until summer. So I
started 100Devs at October of

667
00:32:56,846 --> 00:33:00,000
2020, then I got into Collab
Lab, let's say, like, July. So

669
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,300
... like, eight months? Seven,
eight months? Sorry. I had to

670
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:08,500
count [all laugh]. Before -- you
know, I- I mean, even then, I- I

671
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,300
didn't feel comfortable. I
didn't think I was gonna get

672
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,000
accepted to tell you the truth.
Then, an- another 100Dev-er, she

673
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
said, "Hey, you gotta shoot your
shots. You don't know-

675
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,700
Bekah: Yeah.

676
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,811
Yolanda: -until you try." Cuz I-
I have this, like, very low

675
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:20,611
confidence, you know? I was
like, "I'm not good enough," or

677
00:33:22,442 --> 00:33:26,000
"I'll- I'll need another year
before I -- I'm -- I can even do

679
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,251
X, Y, and Z." So, she's like,
"Hey, if it doesn't work out,

680
00:33:29,251 --> 00:33:33,346
there's- there's no negative
impact. Like, you just try again

681
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:35,747
at the next cohort." I'm like,
"Okay. Yeah, there's nothing

682
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:40,396
wrong. There's no consequences."
So, I applied in, lo and behold,

683
00:33:40,396 --> 00:33:43,700
I got accepted. So, I just
thank to that person, that

684
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:48,000
helped me out and pushed me for
that. So, I- I think, I had,

685
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
like, eight months ex-
experience before I applied to

686
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Collab Lab. And then maybe a
month of React experience. So,

687
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,457
very little. Very, very baby
chick stage of that [laughs].

688
00:34:00,336 --> 00:34:02,500
Bekah: [Chuckles] Do you feel
like it helped you when you ...

689
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,426
moved on?

689
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:08,766
Yolanda: It helped ... me gain a
better understanding of how

690
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:10,000
collaboration works.

691
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,300
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

692
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,000
Yolanda: In the 100Devs, we did
work on a team project. So that-

691
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
that was helpful, but it's-

692
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,500
Bekah: Nice.

692
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,500
Yolanda: -a lot of newbies as
well, [chuckles] you know,

693
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,000
working on a project to-
together.

694
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,416
So, there was a lot of ... "I
think this is what we're

695
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:25,500
supposed to do," kinda thing.
Or like, "How do we share the

696
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,000
code?" Or, you know, "If- if one
changed, do we just share it

697
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,300
through, like, Google docs?"
So, it was -- it's still a

698
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:37,000
lot of how the process, kind
of, "What do we do?" "I don't

699
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,300
get it." So, it's a lot of
builders with tools, and we're

701
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,000
just eager to build, and we were
like, "Okay, so what do we do

703
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,300
now?" "What's a blueprint?" You
know? [Laughs] It was like, "Oh,

704
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,431
okay. Maybe we should do that
first," kinda thing. And that's

705
00:34:47,431 --> 00:34:49,300
how it felt. And then, with
Collab Lab, it's like, "Okay,

706
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,700
you guys. This is the
blueprint," you know? "This --

707
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,300
these are your roles." "This is
our expectations of you," you

707
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,500
know? "And this is -- you should
finish this task," you know?

708
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,500
And then, "Before you go on to
the next one." "Don't worry

710
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
about this," you know? "Don't
worry about the color of the

712
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,500
house yet. That's at the very
end," you know? "Worry about

713
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,000
building that ..." I don't know.
I'm not a construction worker.

714
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,000
So, you know, like, the
foundation, the frame, you know?

715
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,500
Focus on that first. So, for
Collab Lab, I was taught, you

716
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,500
know, "Focus on the ... kind of
-- the functionality. Does it

717
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,000
work?" You know, versus making
it look pretty. Cuz I'm- I'm a

718
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,700
visual person. So, I was like,
"Oh, maybe it needs to look this

719
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,000
way first." And they were like,
"Yes, it should look this way,"

721
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,500
or, "It's great to look that
way. But maybe, we should focus

723
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,500
on ... does it work? Does this
button work, no matter how ugly

725
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,300
it is? [Laughs] Is it -- does
it click? And if it clicks, does

726
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,000
it go to or do its thing?" So,
that's what I've learned is,

727
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,181
"Oh, okay. There's this way of
building things," which was,

728
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:48,500
like, fantastic. And very
different from what I've learned

730
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,657
in 100Devs. So ... yeah.

731
00:35:51,657 --> 00:35:54,476
Dan: That's great. It sounds
like a- a- a great learning

732
00:35:54,476 --> 00:35:57,500
experience. And- and something
that I thought I would ... just

733
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,000
having -- I mean, I haven't ever
done it, obviously. But like, I-

734
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I would encourage anybody to do
because that's sort of the ...

736
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
you know, learning, like, actual
coding is important, obviously

737
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,700
[laughs]. But there's so much
that goes into a job, or- or- or

738
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,500
a project, or anything like
that, that isn't just writing

739
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,886
code, you know? And there's ...
you know,

740
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:22,097
lots of people have lots of
trouble, like, getting kinda

741
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:25,036
started up with any project or
with, you know, in a new

742
00:36:25,036 --> 00:36:28,456
company if they don't have this
sort of experience. And ...

743
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:32,000
having that, like, confidence
to, you know, to know like,

744
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,300
"Okay, I know how to do code
review," you know what I mean?

745
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,000
"I know how to do ... oh, you
know, pull requests even. All

746
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
that -- all of us -- all this
stuff, I know," you know? I ...

747
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
just -- that it -- that it's like
something that ... you know,

748
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
to go through this level of
practice at it, you know, it

749
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,186
gives you that, like, the full
confidence to ... "I don't even

750
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:51,166
worry about it anymore," right?
It almost becomes second nature,

751
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:54,000
right? And so that -- so, like,
if you go into a job interview,

752
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
for instance, you don't have to,
like, sweat about that part,

753
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
[chuckles] you know? Anything

753
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,867
you don't have to sweat about
is- is good. And I think,

754
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:02,000
usually, like, the job
interviewers can probably tell.

755
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Like, when you're sweating, when
you're not, about- about certain

756
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,300
things, you know? And, you know,
but work with people, it's -- it

757
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,272
is -- it's been an important
skill [laughs]. And it's hard to-

758
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,500
hard to, like, display on a
resume too, you know?

759
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,300
So, The Collab Lab, you know,
completing The Collab Lab thing

760
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,137
is- is, like, a nice, like,
easy- easy to point to, you

761
00:37:22,137 --> 00:37:24,027
know, thing. Oh, that's really
cool.

762
00:37:24,856 --> 00:37:25,036
Yolanda: Yeah. It's like --

763
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:25,300
Bekah: Yeah.

764
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,300
Yolanda: Oh, sorry.

763
00:37:27,226 --> 00:37:29,146
Bekah: I was just gonna say, I
think that you've done a great

764
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:33,077
job, like, constructing your
learning how to code journey

765
00:37:33,137 --> 00:37:36,317
through all of the opportunities
that you've done, and, you know,

766
00:37:36,317 --> 00:37:38,327
all of the skills that you've
learned. It feels like you've

768
00:37:38,327 --> 00:37:42,496
got a very well-rounded
experience coming out of that.

769
00:37:44,117 --> 00:37:46,700
Yolanda: I -- yeah, I think so
-- I hope so. I mean, [Bekah

770
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,300
chuckles] better than when I
try to do it on my own.

771
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,976
So, [laughs] I- I cannot
complain. It's ... you know, I-

772
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:57,000
I just wished ... I wish I knew
it was gonna take this long.

773
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Then I would have really-

774
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,200
Bekah: Mm.

775
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,411
Yolanda: -took my time with it
and just kind of savor the taste

774
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:03,700
instead of trying to rush and
try everything [laughs] or do

776
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,500
everything. But, yeah. I'm --
but- but then [sigh], it's just

777
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,000
been helpful because ... awful
-- but, you know, the, you know,

778
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
the situation that we're all put
in with COVID. And I don't know

780
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,572
if I would be where I'm at today
... if it -- if that didn't

781
00:38:20,572 --> 00:38:21,900
happen. Because, you know-

782
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,000
Bekah: Mm.

782
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Yolanda: -when I try to learn
how to code, I was working,

783
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,652
you know, 30, 40 hours and try
to do coding on the side.

785
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:31,500
But with COVID, I was able to
focus, you know? And- and try

787
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,000
to, you know, find the community
that I felt comfortable in. And-

789
00:38:35,811 --> 00:38:38,000
and then just kind of, "Tada,
here I am." [Laughs] [Dan

790
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
chuckles] It's just -- it's-
it's help- and it's very helpful

791
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
to have these free communities
too, you know? Virtual Coffee,

792
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,700
100Devs, Collab Lab, you know?
It wasn't out of my pocket.

793
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,500
So the money that I was able to
save a lot goes through, you

794
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,500
know, bills, food, or, you know,
emergency, whatever. So, it's

795
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,500
just ... it's really nice that
this -- in this day and age,

797
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,000
there's still a lot of people
who want to help other people

799
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,700
without ... you know, with the
kindness of their heart and

800
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,500
their time, you know? Cuz it's
not- it's not an easy thing to

801
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,317
do and ... yeah. Anyways
[laughs] --

802
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,500
Dan: Yeah, no. It- it -- that's
important. It's just like you're

803
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,700
helping with ... 100Devs, right?
You're volunteering with them

804
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,246
and stuff. It's- it's always
cool to be able to, like, once

805
00:39:23,246 --> 00:39:27,500
you have ... s-some amount of
time or- or space available to

806
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,531
yourself, to ... you know, to be
able to give back in ways since

808
00:39:30,531 --> 00:39:32,000
... it's neat [??].

809
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Bekah: Yeah, well--

809
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,000
Dan: It's cool that -- oh, go
ahead.

809
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:37,000
Bekah: I was gonna say too,
like, you have done note-taking

810
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,700
for us too at Virtual Coffee.
And you're- you're usually

811
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,446
there. You are on the west 
coast, but you are there, 6 AM,

812
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:46,726
your time, frequently.

813
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:52,000
And I- I just, I love to see it.
I -- it's- it's so, you know ...

814
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,700
I know, like, what a testament
it is to your character, that

815
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,700
you are so willing to give back
and to support the communities

816
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,456
that you've been a part of.

817
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,300
Yolanda: Yeah. I think it's-
it's because, you know, I- I

818
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,653
feel comfortable being

818
00:40:07,653 --> 00:40:09,994
in the communi- community, you
know? Virtual Coffee from the

819
00:40:09,994 --> 00:40:12,900
get-go. I think, I- I messaged
you, Bekah, it was like- it was

820
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,500
like love at first sight. That
first meeting, I -- it was very-

821
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,599
it was very nice. And I mean, I
probably really doing it, get

822
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,000
involved with Virtual Coffee,
until months later. I know,

824
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,800
like, Nerando would, like, edge
me. Like, he was like, saying,

825
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,818
"Hey, [unintelligible]." He was
like, "What do you think,

826
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:31,300
Yolanda?" Or like, "I want you
to, you know, have a

827
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,000
conversation too." Cuz I was
mainly a fly on the wall in

828
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
every meetup, you know? It's
just like, I just wanna listen

829
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
[chuckles]. Cuz I feel at that
time, I can't contr- or -- yeah.

830
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
As silly as it was, I felt like,
"Oh, yeah. There's this new --

831
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,300
I'm the new person. I- I can't
contribute to this discussion.

832
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,700
There's -- I can't say anything.
There's no vital information.

833
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,300
So I'm just gonna keep my mouth
shut and just- and just listen."

835
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,000
And that was, oof, for a f- a
few months. But with the

836
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
consistency, I think [chuckles]
other members, like, sees me,

838
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,500
and they're like, "Hey, so what
do you think, Yolanda?" Or,

839
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,000
"Hey, Yolanda. Long --" you
know, "Good to see you on here."

840
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And because of that, and then
reaching out to me, and kind of

841
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
putting me on the spot, kind of
broke the ice. At least for me,

842
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
it- it helped me get more
comfortable. And then, finally,

843
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
took the plunge of like, "Okay.
I think I could help out with

844
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,018
the note-taking." I think it
was, like, Meg needed a help or

845
00:41:22,018 --> 00:41:25,000
something in one of the rooms.
And I'm like, "[Breaths fast]

846
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,728
Okay. I- I think I can do this
[laughs]." [Dan chuckles]

848
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:32,300
Bekah: Yeah. So I wanna back up
a little bit, kind of? I don't

849
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,500
know if it's backing up. But
[laughs] you mentioned that

850
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:40,000
you're a mom too. And we talked
about this journey and ... is --

852
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
we all, you know, that it's
challenging to be a parent

853
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
[chuckles] and to be working,
especially during COVID times

854
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,800
and- and learning. So, I- I feel
like, anytime we can hear the

855
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:59,264
story of ... you know, how you
survived [chuckles]

857
00:41:59,264 --> 00:42:04,273
being a parent and learning,
or working through things, I

858
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:07,364
think that that story looks a
lot different than- than other

859
00:42:07,364 --> 00:42:11,623
people's stories who, you know,
might not have all of the same

860
00:42:11,623 --> 00:42:15,000
responsibilities. So what do you
think -- w-what -- how was that

861
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,914
for you as a mom?

862
00:42:16,623 --> 00:42:20,000
Yolanda: Oof. It was tough. It
is tough. It's still tough.

864
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

864
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:26,923
Yolanda: It's-

865
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,000 
Bekah: Yeah.

866
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,000
Yolanda: -not easy. I ... I
mean, I'm very fortunate that I

865
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,500
do have my husband, you know?
And he does help out. But it's-

866
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:33,800
it's just ... [sighs] it- it was
-- it is, it's difficult. It's a

867
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,000
lot of trying to figure out when
can I study, you know? I have —

868
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
at that time — 2-year-old saying
like, "Hey, play with me," you

869
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,500
know? Like-

870
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

871
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,000
Yolanda: -"Let's play together."
Because he sees me here, you

870
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
know, on the computer, at home.
So, it's, you know, play time

871
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,523
[chuckles]. No matter how hard I
try, it was like, "Okay, give-

872
00:42:51,523 --> 00:42:54,300
give me five minutes," or ...
you know? But they don't- they

873
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,000
don't understand time. You-

874
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,200
Bekah: Yep.

875
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,000
Yolanda: -you say five, they
think it's, like, now [laughs].

875
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,700
So ... and then, you know, it's
just trying to adjust the

876
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,000
schedule. I remember trying to
wake up, you know, five in the

877
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,308
morning to try to learn how to
code. And then, of course, my

879
00:43:08,308 --> 00:43:13,094
little one — three, at that time
— he would wake up, and he

880
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:18,500
wouldn't see me or he'll look
for me. So, I couldn't really

881
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,500
code. Cuz then, he wants to --
you know, I can't keep him up

883
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,700
at 5 AM. He still needs to
sleep. So-

884
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

885
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Yolanda: -and I'll go back in
bed and try to put him, you

886
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
know, back to sleep. And then,
when I try to,

887
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,500
I think I -- I thought I ninja
my way out, but oh, no. He wakes

888
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,938
up like five minutes later
[laughs]. I was like, "Okay,

889
00:43:35,969 --> 00:43:39,000
that didn't work." And then,
I'll try to stay up late to

890
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,500
learn how to code. And sometimes
that doesn't work. Because he

891
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,500
wants mommy to be in bed with
him to, you know, go to sleep.

892
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,000
I'll try to ask my husband, and
he'll try to help out. But it's

893
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,500
always like, "No, but I want
mommy." And I'm like, "Mommy's

894
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,700
busy." [Yolanda and Dan chuckle]
So I will try that. And then,

895
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,500
I'll do like, 11, 12 o'clock ...
at night, 1 o'clock, trying to

897
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,000
code. But then, I'm already
tired.

898
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:01,500
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

899
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,000
Yolanda: So, was it effective? I
don't know. It's -- it felt like

899
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,434
-- it reminded me of college,
where you look at the textbook

900
00:44:06,943 --> 00:44:09,193
and you're reading that same
paragraph. And you're like, "Oh,

901
00:44:09,224 --> 00:44:11,893
crap. I think I just read that
paragraph. Okay. I'm gonna

902
00:44:11,893 --> 00:44:14,500
focus. Let me read it again
[laughs]." But nothing stick.

903
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,000
And you're like, "Oh. Hmm. What
did I just read?" So, it felt

904
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
like that for- for many months.
Just trying to find ways to-

905
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
to do everything. And then I had
a talk with my husband and

906
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,700
saying, "Hey, is it okay if I
cut back on work and focus on

907
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,000
school, or, you know, Leon's
class? Because the end goal is

908
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,500
to make that career change."
And, you know, luckily, his job

909
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,000
wasn't affected by the- the
COVID. So, he's still -- he was

910
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
still working. So he said,
"Yeah, yeah, we can do that."

911
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
So ... and then, you know,

912
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,284
I'll -- and also fortunately
we are able to put my kid in

913
00:44:51,284 --> 00:44:55,063
daycares. So, you know, just
part-time. So we did that. And

914
00:44:55,063 --> 00:44:58,333
that -- all those pieces kind of
fell together and it helped me

915
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:01,393
out, personally. So I was very
fortunate and, you know,

916
00:45:01,423 --> 00:45:05,264
supportive husband didn't lose
his job, had daycare, so this

917
00:45:05,264 --> 00:45:09,400
kind of stars semi-aligned. And
I was able to kind of learn

919
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,800
through that. But it wasn't
easy. A lot of nights that I

920
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,000
cried. A lot of nights that I- I
mean ... argued. A lot of

921
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,500
nights that I -- not even
nights. Just days, I just wanna

921
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:24,000
scream into the void, like,
"Why?" And, you know, tho-

923
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,700
thought process of like, "If I
didn't have a kid, I probably

924
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,000
would've gotten this earlier,
better, faster," you know? And

925
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,700
... then, kind of look at him,
and he smiles, and gives me a

926
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,000
hug, I'm like, "Damn it. Why did
I think of that?" You know [Bekah

927
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,500
laughs], "They're terrible
thoughts!" And it's like, "Okay,

928
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,300
it's worth it." He's -- he
doesn't know any better. So,

00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:42,500
it's --

929
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,500
Bekah: Hashtag mom life.

929
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,800
Yolanda: Yes. He's -- it's a lot
of- of back and forth. Like, I

930
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,300
wish- I wish I didn't change my
mind by- back in college, but

932
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,700
then, I wouldn't have taught
abroad. Then I wouldn't have had
 
933
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:58,000
built those friendship and
relationships. And it's just ...

934
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I don't know. But being a mom is
hard. And ... that's just ...

935
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,503
that was my rant. Sorry
[laughs].

936
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,300
Bekah: No.

935
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:12,700
Dan: No. Yeah, it's- it's hard.
It's hard to- to ... I mean,

936
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,700
it's definitely hard to learn,
you know? It's hard to really do

937
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,800
any development work when, you
know, when you're tired or for

938
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,300
me, I guess, personally. But,
like, I feel like this is pretty

939
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,700
common. But, you know, when your
brain -- it's -- when you're

940
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,500
tired, your brain doesn't work
quite at its, like, its normal

940
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:31,500
level. And ... parenting is
being tired a lot. [Chuckles]

941
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,500
And, you know, it's just like,
it's hard. It's- it's hard. So,

943
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,000
I -- we are appreciate you
sharing with us. Cuz it's ...

944
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,700
I've- I've had a lot of similar
experiences. It's a lot of late

945
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,813
nights, and a lot of yelling,
and stuff not going through your

947
00:46:43,813 --> 00:46:47,000
brain that you think should be
going through. Like ... I -- you

948
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,500
know, I should be able to figure
this out kind of thing, right?

949
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,000
[Laughs] And then, I'm like,
"Oh, wait. I was up for -- I was

951
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,500
only asleep for like two hours
last night [chuckles]. And then

952
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,329
-- maybe that's why," you know?
So, yes.

952
00:46:58,264 --> 00:47:00,784
Bekah: And I think, you know,
it's hard. I've talked to a lot

953
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:05,164
of moms who have felt those
frustrations and you- you see

954
00:47:05,193 --> 00:47:08,583
stories on Twitter or wherever,
where people are flying through

955
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:10,800
things. And then, you play the
comparison game, like, "Well,

956
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,500
how come they're there, and I'm
not there?" And you know, I- I

958
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,700
can't tell you how many times
I've talked to another mom who

959
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,000
was struggling in that journey.

960
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,478
Like, "Well, I'm staying up
late, and I'm waking up early,

961
00:47:21,478 --> 00:47:23,000
and I'm putting in all this
time, and it's still not

962
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
sticking." I'm like,

962
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,639
"How many hours of sleep are
you getting a night? Four? Well,

963
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:30,599
it's- it's not going to stick."
And you know, you said something

964
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:33,088
earlier about, like, "I- I wish
I would have like savored the

965
00:47:33,088 --> 00:47:36,719
journey more," or something like
that. And I- I think that there

966
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,259
is this tendency to wanna rush
through it, or, you know, "These

967
00:47:40,259 --> 00:47:43,259
bootcampers get it done in 12
weeks or whatever. I should be

968
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:46,000
able to get it done in 12
weeks." But you know, that's-

969
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,500
that's not ideal [chuckles]. And
it- it doesn't acknowledge the

970
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:57,700
challenges that- that we face in
our lives ... to be able to do

971
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:04,139
that. Like, Dan, you're saying
like, your brain just cannot ...

972
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:05,500
be a sponge when you're not
getting enough sleep at night.

973
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,300
It's- it's not -- it- it's a
physiological thing [laughs].

974
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:13,700
You ca- you can't break that.
You can't change that part of-

975
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:18,059
of it. And so, you know, putting
a focus on, like, take the

975
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:23,099
time to, like, pace yourself and
learn what you're doing, and

976
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:26,500
savor those moments of the
journey. I -- you -- I'll -- I

977
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,700
say this, like, in retrospect.
But I know, had somebody said

978
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,500
the same thing to me while I was
going through it, I'd be like,

979
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,000
"Uh-huh, sure. Whatever." Like 
[laughs], "Well, I just need to

980
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,500
be done with this and get on
with the real life where things

981
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,500
are easier," is- is not easier.
Like, well, [laughs] I thought

982
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,074
bootcamp was hard. Wait a
minute. Like, this is- this is

983
00:48:46,074 --> 00:48:50,634
harder suddenly. And I'm
terrified. So ... there are

985
00:48:50,634 --> 00:48:55,500
so many other factors. And --
alrite. Somebody had once said,

987
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:00,000
you know, bootcamps should have
... I dunno. Like a- a warning

988
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
or something to say that this is
gonna put intense pressure on

989
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
your relationship. And a lot of
people break up during this time

990
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,352
[chuckles]. Because

991
00:49:08,353 --> 00:49:13,514
there is so much stress and
pressure. And nobody talks about

992
00:49:13,514 --> 00:49:16,700
that. Cuz it like, "Oh, did you
finish? Did your project get

993
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,300
done? Did you get hired?" Not
like [chuckles], "How were you

994
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:25,300
impacted in your life outside of
work and learning?" And so, I

995
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,857
think it's, you know, I very

996
00:49:26,858 --> 00:49:31,509
much appreciate you sharing all
of that. Because I think that --

997
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:37,449
I wish that more people talked
about it. So, people who are

998
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:41,739
coming into tech, like, know
there's a lot of pressure in

999
00:49:41,739 --> 00:49:42,398
these things.

1000
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:46,648
Yolanda: So much pressure. I --
pressure on ourselves, I think,

1001
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:47,000
you know? And I-

1002
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,300
Bekah: Yeah.

1002
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,219
Yolanda: -keep comparing myself
to others — that comparison

1003
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:52,588
game that you said, you know?
It's a terrible game to play.

1004
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:54,000
Terrible, terrible, you know?

1005
00:49:53,643 --> 00:49:57,003
Bekah: I was comparing my ca-
self to Kent C. Dodds. I'm like,

1006
00:49:57,003 --> 00:49:57,500
this is [Bekah and Yolanda
laugh] ... I don't know why.

1007
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,000
That's not really realistic, but
I'm like, "Why am I not like

1008
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,594
that?" Like --

1009
00:50:01,594 --> 00:50:03,784
Yolanda: Yeah, it's just -- cuz
you see it, you know? Like, all

1010
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:06,500
-- you know, they- they did it.
They get it. Why can't I? You

1012
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:11,000
know? Or I'll ... forget that
I'm- I'm a- I'm a mom, you know?

1013
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:11,500
And-

1014
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

1013
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,500
Yolanda: -I have these
obligations, because I was

1014
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,700
thinking, "Ah, in college, I
didn't struggle this much, did

1015
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,000
I?"

1016
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,500
Bekah: Yeah.

1014
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,500
Yolanda: Like, "I got it." Like,
"What- what's different from

1015
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,700
college and now?" I mean, I was
-- like, college was like 15

1016
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,500
years ago. I had to calculate it
[Bekah chuckles]. It's just

1017
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,000
like [Dan chuckles] -- you
know, and back then, it was

1018
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,264
just me. I was just -- like,
there's no other- there's no

1018
00:50:29,264 --> 00:50:32,700
other ... little ones or, you
know, people that I have to kind

1019
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,000
of focus on to take care of. So,
yeah. So, I -- somebody told me

1020
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,700
like, "Compare to yourself." And
I was like, "Oh, that's not

1022
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,800
fun." Like, compare ... you
know, like, it's just -- I- I

1023
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,744
should -- and it -- I get what
they're saying. Cuz you --

1023
00:50:44,744 --> 00:50:48,463
I'm looking back a year ago.
Where was I? You know? What is

1024
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:51,643
today? March? And I think, I was
still learning JavaScript. And

1025
00:50:51,643 --> 00:50:54,000
s- probably feeling frustrated
the year ago saying-

1026
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,300
Bekah: Yeah.

1026
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,000
Yolanda: -"I don't get it. What-
what do you mean I have to do

1027
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,974
this? Like, it doesn't make

1027
00:50:57,974 --> 00:51:00,733
sense." And right now, it still
doesn't make sense. But it's a

1028
00:51:00,733 --> 00:51:05,500
little ... a little -- I get a
better idea. So ... yeah.

1029
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,700
Somebody -- I- I try to do that.
And he's like, "Okay, where was

1030
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:12,500
I before?" You know? "Where was
I yesterday? Did I have a least

1031
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,433
1% of improvement today, kinda
thing?" So, I think that was,

1033
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:18,000
like, through also "Atomic
Habits", you know? Just that

1035
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,300
microscopic improvement and- and
focus on that. So, I think that

1036
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:25,000
helps me out as well. Just the
tiniest of the tiny victory.

1037
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,700
So, if I could just put in, you
know, five minutes of whatever

1038
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,523
learning, "Yay, I did it!
That's my victory. One step,

1039
00:51:31,643 --> 00:51:34,700
tiny step forward [chuckles],"
instead of saying, "Oh, I only

1040
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,300
spent five minutes," you know?
It's like, try to change that

1041
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:42,000
mindset. Which is so hard. But
the pressure is hard. The

1042
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,003
comparison game is hard
[chuckles]. Everything is hard.

1043
00:51:44,003 --> 00:51:45,000
So hard.

1043
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,000
Bekah: Is it -- is -- you -- I
feel like -- I was like, "Oh,

1044
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,474
there should be Calendly links
to, like, meet with your mentor,

1045
00:51:52,474 --> 00:51:54,139
slash meet with your therapist."
Like, [chuckles] they should be

1046
00:51:54,139 --> 00:51:57,000
right next to each other. Cuz I
think it would be useful

1047
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,300
[chuckles]. Well, I wanna thank
you, Yolanda, for being here and

1048
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,300
sharing your journey with us.
Cuz I think this is super

1049
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:10,700
valuable and a lot of people are
gonna learn from this episode.

1051
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:15,000
Are there any -- do you wanna
share any of your biggest

1052
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,500
lessons or tips for those out
there listening, before we head

1054
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,539
off for the day?

1055
00:52:24,704 --> 00:52:26,084
Yolanda: Ah, biggest question.
Um ... take your time. It takes

1057
00:52:26,084 --> 00:52:28,700
time. Sorry. I should say, it
takes time. Everything takes

1058
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:34,000
time. Try to have that ingrained
in your head. It's just ...

1059
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,620
everything takes time.
Networking takes time. Learning

1060
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,500
how to code takes time. Finding
a job takes time [chuckles].

1061
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,300
Then, you know, the- the main
foundation is -- it- it just, it

1062
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,534
takes time. So, I wish I had
that ingrained in me, instead

1063
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:52,289
of hurry, hurry, hurry, fear of
missing out. It's just stop,

1064
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,070
breathe, and like, "Okay, it's
gonna- it's gonna take time. And

1065
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:59,130
that is okay. That is definitely
okay. I'm not gonna miss out

1066
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:03,570
on jobs. I'm not gonna miss out
on opportunities. Because I'm

1068
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:07,300
just gonna focus on what I can
do at this moment in time. And

1070
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,300
if that's all I can do, that's
all I can do." So, just- just

1071
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,090
take it easy [chuckles].

1072
00:53:14,074 --> 00:53:16,500
Dan: I love that. Yeah, I love
that advice a lot [chuckles]. I

1073
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,500
think that- I think that's a
great note to end on. And I

1075
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,700
wanna say, thank you to Yolanda,
too. I- I really appreciate

1076
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:26,500
hearing about ... well,
everything, really. It was- it

1077
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,000
was- it was good. I think what
Bekah said is right. A lot of

1078
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,500
people are gonna find this
really valuable. So, thank you

1078
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,565
again for coming on.

1079
00:53:33,684 --> 00:53:34,135
Bekah: Bye.
