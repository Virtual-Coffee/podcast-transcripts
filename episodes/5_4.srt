00:00:03,883 --> 00:00:07,033
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season five, episode four of the

2
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:09,742
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

3
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:12,451
that

4
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:16,202
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:17,566
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:18,930
their

7
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:21,812
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:23,252
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

9
00:00:23,252 --> 00:00:24,692
it with

10
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,602
you here with me. Today is my
cohost Dan.

11
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:31,774
Dan: Yo what's up, Bekah! Today
we talked with Yolanda Hanes.

12
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:35,654
Yolanda is a career changer. She
was previously working in

13
00:00:35,654 --> 00:00:38,594
healthcare as a certified
occupational therapy assistant

14
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:43,694
and, um, switched to doing
development. And so we talked

15
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:45,374
about her decision-making
process through that, um, her

16
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:47,054
journey

17
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:50,984
through, um, you know, learning,
learning on your own, then some

18
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:56,024
bootcamp stuff she did. Um, A
100Devs, um, and Collab Lab,

19
00:00:56,054 --> 00:00:59,164
which I was like, which she
shared a lot about. And, um, it

20
00:00:59,164 --> 00:01:03,043
sounds like a very cool
experience for her. And, um,

21
00:01:03,704 --> 00:01:05,054
yeah, I don't know. What else
did we talk about?

22
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:08,073
Bekah: No. I love being able to
talk to her journey and hear

23
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:10,818
what

24
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:15,254
she thinks like in retrospect of
that journey, because there's

25
00:01:15,254 --> 00:01:20,024
always that I want to do all of
the things and try all of the

26
00:01:20,024 --> 00:01:23,293
things and everybody else is
going so fast and I'm going slow

27
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:27,134
or not at the same pace. And she
talks about the impacts of being

28
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:29,353
a mom on that. And so it's
really great to hear those

29
00:01:29,353 --> 00:01:31,572
reflections

30
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:35,054
because I think they're super
insightful for anybody who's

31
00:01:35,414 --> 00:01:36,493
learning anything.

32
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:39,503
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. Um, no,
I, I love hearing about it too.

33
00:01:39,503 --> 00:01:41,273
And

34
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:44,774
I was wondering, you know,
Started out doing all this stuff

35
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:47,653
long before there are any
bootcamps, you know, at all. I

36
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:51,043
always wonder, uh, how, you
know, I think it might've been

37
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:54,554
different. Um, if there, that,
that was available at the time.

38
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:57,328
Um, and now there's of course
too many options, but it's like

39
00:01:57,328 --> 00:01:59,563
swung

40
00:01:59,563 --> 00:02:00,898
the other way. Um, but it was,
it was cool hearing it from

41
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:02,233
Yolanda

42
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:04,424
cause she's, she tried a few
different or did a few different

43
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,133
things and, um, I think it was
pretty successful at all of

44
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:07,842
them.

45
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,428
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. She did
an excellent job, like

46
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:12,318
piecemealing

47
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:14,598
together, a pretty good
educational path for herself.

48
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:16,878
And

49
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:19,158
like you said, that could be
really hard. Cause there, there

50
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:21,288
is so much out there and you
kind of have to wade through a

51
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:23,418
lot of

52
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:27,348
different things to figure out
what works for you and gets you

53
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:28,098
where you need to be.

54
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:31,954
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. Well, we
had a great time talking with

55
00:02:31,954 --> 00:02:34,593
Yolanda and I know you're going
to enjoy listen to it.

56
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:38,008
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast like we start every

57
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:41,038
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

58
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:42,838
we're from, what we do and
random checking question. We

59
00:02:42,838 --> 00:02:44,638
hope you

60
00:02:44,638 --> 00:02:54,856
enjoy this episode. Today's
random check-in question is

61
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:58,637
what's your go-to snack when you
don't feel like making a full

62
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:01,052
meal. So my name is Bekah. I am
a technical community builder

63
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:03,467
from

64
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:05,672
a small town in Ohio. And for
the last three days, I've eaten

65
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:07,877
Chips

66
00:03:07,877 --> 00:03:10,052
and salsa. for almost every
single meal. So that is for

67
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:12,227
sure,

68
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:14,146
my, my go-to answer here.

69
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:19,429
Dan: Chips and salsa. Always
good. Um, hi, I'm Dan. I do web

70
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:21,528
development from, uh, in
Cleveland, Ohio, and, um, Yeah,

71
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:23,627
I

72
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:27,468
dunno. I think in those
situations, I like to go the

73
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:31,218
lowest effort possible. Um, if
I, if there's like apples in the

74
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:32,133
fridge, that's going to be,
that's going to be a big one,

75
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:33,048
you

76
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:36,049
know, and just like, kind of
take it out and eat it. Um, or a

77
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,538
banana or something like that.
You know, if there's like

78
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,343
Bekah: you keep your apples in
the fridge. Are you supposed to

79
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:41,854
do that?

80
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,109
Dan: uh, I think it keeps them
fresh. They're long, fresh,

81
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:46,719
longer. Maybe. I, I don't know.
I like when they're cold, I

82
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,329
don't,

83
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:55,658
I don't know why, but, um, The,
I, I just always have, I don't.

84
00:03:57,218 --> 00:03:58,508
No, no, no, no. I don't know.

85
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:02,174
Bekah: I wasn't sure if I was
doing it

86
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:05,169
Dan: I don't think there's like,
I think it just like was like

87
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:06,353
store-bought ones, especially,
it just keeps them fresh longer.

88
00:04:06,353 --> 00:04:07,537
It

89
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,788
like, you know, makes them last
longer. I think that's, I think

90
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:12,278
that's the main thing. There's
nothing wrong.

91
00:04:12,473 --> 00:04:13,913
Bekah: you don't keep in the
fridge. Cause then they get

92
00:04:13,913 --> 00:04:16,434
grainy. But apples don't right.

93
00:04:17,487 --> 00:04:24,776
Dan: I don't know, that's it.
That's all I got. I, I, my, my

94
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:26,156
cold apples, that's my snack.

95
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:32,057
Yolanda: hello. Um, my name is
Yolanda I'm from San Diego,

96
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:36,166
California, and my role is a
junior software engineer. Um, my

97
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,916
go-to snack or easy meal. Um, so
there's this Japanese thing

98
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,547
called Ochazuke, and that's the
easiest meal I can make. It's

99
00:04:43,547 --> 00:04:48,197
rice hot water, and there's like
a packet of, um, um, flavor. And

100
00:04:48,197 --> 00:04:51,391
then you just. Pour hot water
over that packet of flavor and

101
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,601
rice. And that is like the
easiest meal. It's not really a

102
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:57,391
snack, but it's my go-to when I
don't feel like cooking at all,

103
00:04:57,632 --> 00:05:00,062
the rice keeps me full and it's
just like this hot water. It's

104
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:07,172
just a blend of happiness. So
that, that is kind of my go-to,

105
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:12,182
um, easy meal slash snack. Uh,
but I did not know you weren't

106
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:14,822
supposed to put tomatoes in the
fridge cause I do it.

107
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:19,877
Bekah: I've heard that it makes
some grainy

108
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:25,406
Yolanda: But I keep my apples on
the counter. So I don't know.

109
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:27,377
Bekah: tomatoes go really bad,
fast too. If you keep them on

110
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:28,697
the

111
00:05:28,697 --> 00:05:31,627
counter. So you just have to eat
them really quickly. I feel.

112
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:33,346
Yolanda: Got it.

113
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:38,581
Bekah: I don't know. I, um, one
of my favorite things I've done

114
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:41,401
in the last year, I always saw,
like, you could buy packets of

115
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:44,672
rice that you heat up in the
microwave. It's like 90 seconds.

116
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:45,856
And like, it doesn't even take
that long to make rice. Why

117
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:47,040
would

118
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,802
you do that? And now I have like
a cupboard stash full of

119
00:05:50,372 --> 00:05:52,562
90-second rice. Cause it's so
easy.

120
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:56,146
Yolanda: Is it, is it good? I
don't think I've tried that.

121
00:05:56,716 --> 00:05:59,311
Bekah: It's decent. I like to
buy the Jasmine rice. Um, and

122
00:05:59,311 --> 00:06:01,906
that, I

123
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:05,567
feel like it's probably better
than what I make on the stove

124
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,051
top, because I normally forget
that I'm making rice and then

125
00:06:07,051 --> 00:06:08,535
I'm

126
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,831
like also way more likely to
burn it. So you cannot, well, as

127
00:06:10,831 --> 00:06:13,126
far

128
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:15,076
as I know you can't burn it in
the microwave. I could probably

129
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:16,156
find a way to do that. too,
though.

130
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:19,737
Yolanda: I guess it's opposite
for me, Asian household. So I

131
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:23,461
have a rice cooker and it's.
There's always price. There's

132
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:29,581
never a time. So it's just, I
don't think I've ever burnt rice

133
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:32,192
because rice cooker kind of it's
easy peasy just to kind

134
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:33,356
Bekah: oh, I think I burnt it in
the rice cooker before. I think

135
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:34,511
I

136
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:35,562
had to throw away my rice go.

137
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:41,637
Dan: Should've put it in the
fridge.

138
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:48,766
Bekah: Um, well, this is not a
podcast about all of the ways

139
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:53,357
I've ruined food. So we will go
ahead and talk about what we're

140
00:06:53,357 --> 00:06:55,156
really here to talk about, and
that is Yolanda. So, um, we're

141
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:56,955
so

142
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:59,836
happy to have you here with us,
and we always like to start off

143
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:03,797
with your origin story. So, you
know, where are you from and how

144
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:06,797
have you gotten to this point in
your tech journey?

145
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:11,437
Yolanda: Um, good question. Let
me try to make it short. I don't

146
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:13,821
want to take too much of the
time. Um, so I born and raised

147
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:16,205
in

148
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:21,062
San Diego. I. I'm a career
changer. So I used to work in

149
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:25,052
healthcare before I became a
software engineer, but my start

150
00:07:25,052 --> 00:07:30,331
of the journey was probably my
first, um, PC family PC. I want

151
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:34,254
to say it was windows 3.1 was
the LS and. I thought I was a

152
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:38,177
bad-ass

153
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:42,257
by taking apart my family
computer and you know, just

154
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:45,497
saying, oh, okay, this is, this
is what the inside of the

155
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:48,916
computer looks like. You know,
you know, unplug everything. I

156
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,706
think it's called like a VGA
cable, the HDM, I don't even

157
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:54,076
think there was each of the
airlines then, but just all the

158
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:57,887
cables and then open up the
family computer and was just try

159
00:07:57,887 --> 00:07:59,514
to take out some stuff. Yeah.
And I'm like, okay, let me put

160
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:01,141
it

161
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:02,686
back together. And I thought,
oh, I'm a hacker now. Like, I

162
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:04,231
can, I

163
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:07,052
can do this. So that was
probably my first taste of tech

164
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:09,872
was kind

165
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:11,041
of doing that. And then,

166
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,687
Bekah: So you did put it back
successfully though. Cause I was

167
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:15,096
waiting for, and then it didn't

168
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,812
Yolanda: I mean, yeah, I don't
remember getting in trouble or

169
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:22,052
anything breaking. I think
literally it was just unplugging

170
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:28,531
everything, opening the computer
case. And maybe take out around,

171
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:32,251
I am not quite sure. And then
just kind of, you know, put

172
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:34,471
everything together and then
turn on the computer and it

173
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:36,691
worked as

174
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:40,831
if nothing happened. So yeah,
that was kind of, I was very

175
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:44,581
curious and I like to work with
my hands. That was, that kept me

176
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:49,966
busy. Um, and then. Played a lot
of those free games, uh, that

177
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:54,136
came with the computer. So, uh,
I think space cadet was the one

178
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:57,616
it's like a pinball machine. And
there was like a, it came with a

179
00:08:57,616 --> 00:09:01,096
computer free trial or whatever,
and we didn't, you know, buy

180
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:04,876
games. So that was play the same
pinball machine over and over

181
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:09,557
again. Um, and then. I started
learning how to type was in

182
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:13,216
middle school cause they had
those typing program classes. So

183
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:17,236
I really enjoyed that. Um, got a
really good knack at that. And

184
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:21,677
then high school, I started
messing around with, um, trying

185
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:24,767
to fix other people's computer.
I was helping out a neighbor

186
00:09:24,886 --> 00:09:26,686
missing with their bios cause
they had at that time was

187
00:09:26,686 --> 00:09:28,486
windows

188
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:30,256
Vista and she just had some
difficulties with that. And

189
00:09:30,256 --> 00:09:31,995
then.

190
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:36,812
But I had to had my now husband
back then was my boyfriend's

191
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:42,032
help. Cause he was also into
tech. So college, I was thinking

192
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:44,237
of doing computer science. So I
took a comp psych 1 0 1 class

193
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:46,442
and

194
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,451
then I had a friend and they
told me like, oh yeah, you gotta

195
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:50,460
be

196
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:54,182
really smart and really good to
find a job in this field. And at

197
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:57,122
that time off, this was over
over 15 years ago. didn't have

198
00:09:57,122 --> 00:10:00,062
the

199
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:03,991
nice gooeys that we have today.
So when you, you know, try to, I

200
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:06,751
think it was Java and compile
it, it gives you an error and it

201
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:08,311
says, oh, between lines, this
and that, but there's no red

202
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:09,871
squiggly

203
00:10:09,871 --> 00:10:11,551
lines. It was just like, find
what's wrong with it. And I

204
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:13,231
would

205
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:17,822
spend hours just trying to find
what I missed and there'll be a

206
00:10:17,822 --> 00:10:19,742
misspelling or a semi-colon, you
know, something, something

207
00:10:19,742 --> 00:10:21,662
basic.

208
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,996
But I wrote the code, so I
didn't see it. You know, when I

209
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:24,330
asked my

210
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:25,846
friend, you know, they'll see
it. And they're like, oh yeah,

211
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:27,361
It's

212
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:30,721
it's right there. And I'm like,
oh, thanks. Um, but he's like,

213
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:33,272
yeah, if you want to find a job
in this field, you gotta be like

214
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:35,326
really smart and like, oh,
that's that's, that's not me. So

215
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:37,380
I, um,

216
00:10:37,562 --> 00:10:40,006
I sticked with, uh, my original
major, which, which was

217
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,450
Japanese.

218
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:45,751
Cause I was thinking of going to
the linguistics route then. And

219
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:48,481
so I graduated with that with a
minor in media arts and

220
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,111
technology, because I still
wanted some sort of tech, um,

221
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:54,511
learning. So that's what I did.
Then I

222
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:54,626
Bekah: okay.

223
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,054
Yolanda: went abroad. Worked,
um, and taught English in Japan

224
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:58,907
for

225
00:10:58,907 --> 00:11:02,386
about two years and then came
back and thought, oh, what am I

226
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:05,866
going to do? Then I did
occupational therapy, assistant

227
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,426
route. So I was in that field
for about five to six years.

228
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:08,986
Then

229
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:13,907
COVID hit, lost my hours. Then I
learned how to code. So that's

230
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:17,596
where I started my coding
journey, October of 2020. Then I

231
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:20,101
found a job December of 2021. So
kind of took a little over a

232
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:22,606
year

233
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,817
and hearing. With you guys
today?

234
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:30,777
Bekah: awesome. You have like a
couple career pivots, right?

235
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:35,636
Because your major is Japanese
and Utah, and then you did the

236
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:39,746
occupational therapy route and
then came over to tech

237
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:43,076
Yolanda: Yes. It was a windy,
windy journey. I mean, I had

238
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:46,256
other jobs. I think I was an
afterschool program aid. Then I

239
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:49,376
was a dance instructor in
between, so I did a lot of odd

240
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:53,366
jobs here and there before right
here. Right? Yeah.

241
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:58,682
Bekah: That's awesome. Um, and I
know as you're learning, I want

242
00:11:58,682 --> 00:12:00,692
to talk about your learning
journey, because I think that

243
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:05,072
you've done a lot of cool things
and in somewhere along the line,

244
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:10,142
you also had a kid. And so that
impacts your journey too. So

245
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:15,422
let's maybe not talk about the
kid yet and talk about, uh, you

246
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:19,459
know, what, what organizations
or, or what, um, like. Things

247
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:23,496
did

248
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:28,147
you do to help you stay on track
with learning, how to code.

249
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:34,081
Yolanda: Good question. Um, I
think. So I tried a couple of

250
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:36,961
times trying to learn how to
code. Uh, I definitely bought a,

251
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:38,821
you dummy course and it was
like, here's how to build your

252
00:12:38,821 --> 00:12:40,681
first

253
00:12:40,682 --> 00:12:42,391
website or a complete website.
So I did that from start to

254
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:44,100
finish

255
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:47,042
and then thinking, oh, okay.
That's it? I think that was like

256
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:53,072
2015 or later or earlier, or,
yeah, sorry, my times off. But,

257
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:59,447
so I did that and then, um,
nothing came about, and then. I

258
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:01,576
wanted to do a career change,
uh, with another friend who was

259
00:13:01,576 --> 00:13:03,705
also

260
00:13:03,706 --> 00:13:05,386
a Coda. And we were like, oh, we
need to figure out, like, how

261
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:07,066
are

262
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:09,167
we going to what's the, you
know, the end goal? Cause we

263
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:11,267
can't keep

264
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:13,817
transferring patients in our
sixties or seventies. I mean,

265
00:13:13,817 --> 00:13:17,086
technically we can, but it's not
best on our body. So we're like,

266
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:18,286
okay, maybe we should really
focus on learning how to code.

267
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:19,486
So

268
00:13:19,486 --> 00:13:24,557
we tried the Odin project. And
then, um, I tried that and then

269
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:27,346
she had some, um, she had to
deal with some, you know, family

270
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:30,826
stuff. So she had to put that on
pause and I was by myself again.

271
00:13:30,836 --> 00:13:33,321
I'm like, oh, okay. So.
Happened. And then I found a

272
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:35,806
100Devs Leon's

273
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,516
class and it was like a free
bootcamp has been founded, like

274
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,225
I

275
00:13:39,226 --> 00:13:42,466
think through Reddit and I
thought, okay, well it's free. I

276
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:44,976
lost my hours during this
pandemic in 2020. And when it

277
00:13:44,986 --> 00:13:48,496
hurts. So that's how I started
really focusing on learning how

278
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:50,626
to code because the community
was just there. Um, there was a

279
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:52,756
lot

280
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:56,267
of people I could just kind of
rely on and have that

281
00:13:56,326 --> 00:14:02,761
accountability. So I did that.
Well doing part-time work while

282
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:06,451
taking care of the kid and just
being in that community was

283
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:10,802
helpful. And then during that
commute, um, learning, I, my

284
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:12,511
teacher or Leon said like, oh,
networking is very important.

285
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:14,220
And

286
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:17,662
then, um, I found a Virtual
Coffee now I found somebody

287
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:20,192
posted, say, Hey, you should
check out Virtual Coffee. And

288
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,232
that was like November of 2020.
And yeah. And then I just kind

289
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:24,272
of

290
00:14:24,902 --> 00:14:28,846
listened to. All the devs in
there, you know, or people in

291
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:32,687
tech, their journey, how they
studied or, you know, their

292
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:35,576
explanation of things. And that
was helpful. So I kind of tried

293
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:39,134
to combine listening to that.
Doing Leon's class. And of

294
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:42,692
course

295
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:44,581
doing outside stuff, like the
free code camp, I dabbled into

296
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:46,470
it

297
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:50,672
a little bit, trying to solidify
those basic foundations, uh, and

298
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:53,881
other free courses. I think
there's like, that I probably,

299
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:55,831
you know, dabbled in, so here
and there, but I definitely was

300
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:57,781
one

301
00:14:57,782 --> 00:15:03,187
of those people. Bite off way
more than I can chew. So I think

302
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:04,581
it's the fear of missing out.
That was like the, the number

303
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:05,975
one

304
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:09,907
thing. Like I gotta do them all.
I have to, if I don't, I'm not

305
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:13,986
going to get it. So Leon's class
free code camp scrim, the right

306
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:17,106
networking, Virtual Coffee, you
know, these other communities. I

307
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:18,546
got to do them all because if I
don't, you know, I'm not going

308
00:15:18,546 --> 00:15:19,986
to

309
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:23,856
be successful. And, uh, yeah,
definitely burnt out here and

310
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:24,636
there throughout the.

311
00:15:27,062 --> 00:15:30,932
Bekah: Um, can you tell us a
little bit more about learn with

312
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:36,032
Leon? We've had a big influx of
a 100Devs, and I think somebody

313
00:15:36,032 --> 00:15:38,866
told us that, um, His post about
a 100Devs was one of the. top

314
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:41,700
two

315
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:46,231
most viewed posts on Reddit or
something like that. So it's

316
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:51,511
really taken off recently, but
I've heard a lot of positive

317
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:53,476
experiences from there. And I'm
just curious how things work

318
00:15:53,476 --> 00:15:55,441
with

319
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:55,711
that.

320
00:15:56,422 --> 00:16:00,711
Yolanda: Uh, yeah, I, this year
is just crazy amount of people

321
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:06,481
who joined. I think the first
session Leon had. Views on his

322
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:08,401
Twitch. And that is, that was
just crazy. Yeah. When I

323
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,321
started,

324
00:16:10,741 --> 00:16:17,131
I want to say we had about 3000
at the start, maybe two. And

325
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:20,822
that, uh, and that was like his
somewhat first time of doing it.

326
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:24,001
I think you had a five week
course prior to doing the a

327
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:26,176
hundred Debs. Um, but when he
did the official 100Devs in

328
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:28,351
October

329
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:31,922
of 2020, I think there was about
two, maybe 3000 of us. Um, one

330
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:35,611
guy Leon does live Twitch
streaming twice a week for three

331
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:38,522
hours, and then he has office
hours for three hours. And then

332
00:16:38,522 --> 00:16:40,404
we just. Go, he does life coding
and then we follow along and

333
00:16:40,404 --> 00:16:42,286
then

334
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:44,927
he assigns homework. Um, so
experience, this is my first

335
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:47,567
boot

336
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:50,057
camp, so there's nothing much
for me to base or compare it to.

337
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:52,547
Um,

338
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:55,427
and I've tried to learn how to
code on my own and I failed

339
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:57,931
miserably. So, um, yeah, Leon's
class helped me at least a

340
00:16:57,931 --> 00:17:00,376
little

341
00:17:00,376 --> 00:17:05,791
fight that foundation and
allowed me to kind of expand. My

342
00:17:05,821 --> 00:17:11,162
skillsets through that. So I
liked it because it helped me

343
00:17:13,592 --> 00:17:20,071
stay focused I guess, and not do
too many things at once. So I

344
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:23,701
thought, okay, Leon's class, let
me just commit. This class is

345
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:25,892
Tuesday, Thursday. I have to be
on class. So I would change my

346
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:27,767
work schedule to make sure I
make it to those class because

347
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:29,642
I'm one

348
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:32,102
of those people. If I miss a
class, I, I don't know if I'm

349
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:37,981
have enough time to play catch
up. So. it, if I'm sex, sex, sex

350
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:43,352
full, I can't even say this word
is then if I'm at that class, I

351
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:45,257
I'm there. I'm going to learn.
And, um, the chances of me to

352
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:47,102
be,

353
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:49,637
um, to find a job in the end
will help me. Then I will do

354
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:52,112
whatever

355
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,362
I can. So, you know, talk to my
husband and say, Hey, can you

356
00:17:54,362 --> 00:17:56,701
watch the little one? Okay. Talk
to all my patients. Hey, I'm

357
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,040
this

358
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:05,882
block. I can't see you because
I'm busy. So. And it was helpful

359
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:10,471
for, to establish that. And then
I relied on that discord

360
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:13,682
community because when I have
questions about homework, I'll

361
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:17,836
reach out, say, Hey, I don't get
it. I don't understand Java

362
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:20,866
script. I don't, it doesn't make
any sense to me, you know, and

363
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,626
then going through Virtual
Coffee, I was like, I don't get

364
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:27,166
JavaScript. Am I ever going to
get it? Like I, how do you guys

365
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,406
get it? And it's, it was very
comforting to hear stories, you

366
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:34,696
know, people would say, yeah, it
sucks. At first, it's going to

367
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,946
click, it's going to take some
time. Don't worry about it. Or,

368
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:40,817
Hey, try these resources. It
might click seeing it this way.

369
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:42,736
So, um, I hope that answered
your question. I think I, I

370
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:44,655
went, I

371
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,257
deviated.

372
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:48,017
Bekah: no. That was great.

373
00:18:49,537 --> 00:18:52,522
Dan: We're all about meandering
topics here. It's the best way

374
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:55,507
to

375
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:56,346
it's the best way to be.

376
00:18:58,007 --> 00:19:01,636
Bekah: Where were the hours? The
office hours live stream to

377
00:19:01,902 --> 00:19:06,872
Yolanda: Yes. So he was live.
Originally it was on Saturdays

378
00:19:06,872 --> 00:19:10,021
and then he switched it to
Sundays for three hours. So I

379
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:12,061
think in the beginning it was
like homework review, and then

380
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:14,101
it

381
00:19:14,162 --> 00:19:18,061
became more of just a, if you
have questions, I'll answer it.

382
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:22,051
So he'll open up and there'll be
like a flood gates of questions

383
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:25,112
and he'll answer it live. So
sometimes it'll be about the

384
00:19:25,112 --> 00:19:27,392
homework. Sometimes it'll just
be about the dev journey, um,

385
00:19:27,392 --> 00:19:29,672
or,

386
00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:32,176
you know, S. Not understanding
the syntax of something and

387
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:34,260
he'll

388
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:36,091
go over it or he'll try to show
it in a different way. So for

389
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,921
me,

390
00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:45,031
that was helpful because it just
kind of, um, that review Liz was

391
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:48,961
nice. So I liked it. It was
helpful.

392
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:52,942
Dan: That's really cool. I mean,
that's a pretty interesting, I

393
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,772
think pretty unique, uh,
approach and it sounds, I mean,

394
00:19:54,772 --> 00:19:56,602
a lot of

395
00:19:56,602 --> 00:19:59,001
people seem pretty into it, so

396
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:03,442
Yolanda: Yeah. It's I think it's
cool. Um, just a lot of work.

397
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:09,076
It's you have to put in the
effort. Um, I, like I said, I

398
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:12,856
don't have any other bootcamp
experience, so this is like

399
00:20:12,886 --> 00:20:17,326
really relying on yourself and
others. Um, and from, I guess

400
00:20:17,326 --> 00:20:20,267
what I've heard other people
who's been through bootcamp and

401
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:21,601
physically been through
bootcamp. There's this kind of

402
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:22,935
nice.

403
00:20:23,602 --> 00:20:25,132
Face-to-face, you know, you
could directly ask the teacher

404
00:20:25,132 --> 00:20:26,662
exactly

405
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:29,751
at that moment when you have,
you know, questions and the

406
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:32,721
accountability, I have a feeling
as much higher doing in-person

407
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:36,832
bootcamp. Um, and then also you
pay, so you really want to make

408
00:20:36,832 --> 00:20:39,066
sure that you complete this
bootcamp while this was free,

409
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:41,300
but

410
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:44,842
it kind of gives you that if you
have other priorities, you don't

411
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:46,612
feel like you have to pick one
or the other. You could always

412
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,382
try

413
00:20:48,382 --> 00:20:50,949
to play catch up. Um, and
there's no money lost only time.

414
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,516
a bad

415
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:59,096
thing. Um, but I like it. It was
enjoyable and I'm helping out

416
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:01,886
right now as a mod. So trying to
give back

417
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:03,826
Dan: Nice. That's

418
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:04,166
Yolanda: I can.

419
00:21:05,596 --> 00:21:11,027
Dan: That's really cool. I, um,
you said something about. You

420
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:13,517
know, when you, when, when you
first started this, how and how

421
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:17,866
it helped you, you know, sort of
focus your learning energy, you

422
00:21:17,866 --> 00:21:19,201
know, like kind of direct it.
And I think that's a, I think

423
00:21:19,201 --> 00:21:20,536
that's

424
00:21:20,537 --> 00:21:22,817
something I wanted to call it
too, is, is it's an important

425
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:24,864
thing to do. And it's one of
the. When people are talking

426
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,911
about

427
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,682
learning, you know, and they're,
and they're just starting out.

428
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:32,551
It's, it's one of the biggest
reasons for, for, for doing some

429
00:21:32,551 --> 00:21:35,622
sort of class, something
structured, a bootcamp or a, uh,

430
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:39,872
course, or the hunter Devacy
knows Tyler or whatever. Um, but

431
00:21:40,442 --> 00:21:44,912
there is, there's just so much
that you could learn. Right. And

432
00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:47,942
it's almost impossible to just,
uh, on your own when you, when

433
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:50,432
you don't know anything to
start, it's almost impossible to

434
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:52,959
self-direct yourself through.
Uh, without, without a plan, you

435
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:55,246
know

436
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:59,747
what I mean? Um, so we've, I've,
I've, I've heard other stories,

437
00:21:59,747 --> 00:22:02,477
you know, it's kinda similar
experiences of, you know, being

438
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:05,777
like, just going all over the
place, stuff, stuff, getting

439
00:22:05,777 --> 00:22:09,317
overloaded. Right. And then, uh,
yeah. And then, and then like

440
00:22:09,317 --> 00:22:12,076
something like the course or
whatever will help you kind of

441
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:16,386
narrow it down. Um, I think it's
important. I'm glad it obviously

442
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:17,477
worked out. It worked well for
you.

443
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:19,686
Yolanda: It did it, did. I had
to like, think about it too. I

444
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,605
was

445
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:25,626
like, what's the best way to
describe this, you know, feeling

446
00:22:25,626 --> 00:22:27,531
in experience and I, and the
best one I could think of is,

447
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:29,436
um, you

448
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:32,826
know, when you go into like an,
all, you can eat sushi bar or

449
00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:36,961
like, you know, a buffet and you
are just overwhelmed. This

450
00:22:36,961 --> 00:22:38,761
plethora of like food and you're
like, where do I start? I'm

451
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:40,561
going

452
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:42,361
to eat it all. And that's what I
feel like was the starting of

453
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,161
the

454
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,461
coding journey. It's like people
say, oh, you got to learn, you

455
00:22:47,461 --> 00:22:48,841
should learn Python. You
shouldn't learn. Excuse me,

456
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:50,221
Java,

457
00:22:50,251 --> 00:22:52,186
JavaScript, HTML, CSS. And
you're like, okay, sure. So I'm

458
00:22:52,186 --> 00:22:54,121
like

459
00:22:54,132 --> 00:22:56,811
going to down the buffet line
and just grabbing. And that's,

460
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:59,490
that's

461
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:00,541
how it felt like in the
beginning was like, okay, I

462
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:01,591
should grab

463
00:23:01,592 --> 00:23:04,321
them all. I need to grab them
all. If I don't, I'm going to

464
00:23:04,321 --> 00:23:07,801
miss out. And if I miss out, I'm
going to miss, you know, I won't

465
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:10,862
know the taste of this delicious
food. And I feel like that's how

466
00:23:10,862 --> 00:23:12,556
it was in the beginning before I
finally slowed down to one

467
00:23:12,556 --> 00:23:14,250
plate.

468
00:23:15,951 --> 00:23:18,771
Bekah: I love it. That's such a
great analogy. And people often

469
00:23:18,771 --> 00:23:20,781
ask too, like, well, what are
you interested in doing? And,

470
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:22,791
and

471
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:23,886
kind of like, you're saying
like, well, you haven't had a

472
00:23:23,886 --> 00:23:24,981
taste of

473
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:27,711
everything. So if you want to
know what you're interested in,

474
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:30,981
then I guess you should probably
sample all of the things, you

475
00:23:30,981 --> 00:23:34,942
know, which is really not
probably it's. I think It's

476
00:23:34,942 --> 00:23:38,122
really hard to know what you're
interested in until you really

477
00:23:38,122 --> 00:23:39,231
have tried it for awhile.

478
00:23:41,912 --> 00:23:43,442
Yolanda: It's like asking a kid,
what do you want to be when you

479
00:23:43,442 --> 00:23:47,192
grew up? I mean, they could
answer, but it's always changing

480
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:50,342
and I don't know. I, your kid, I
feel like for me, at least it's

481
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:53,251
like, I want to do, I want to be
a pediatrician? No, I like

482
00:23:53,251 --> 00:23:56,942
animals. I don't want to be a
vegetarian. He was just like, I

483
00:23:56,942 --> 00:23:58,471
don't know what I really want to
do. I still

484
00:23:58,592 --> 00:24:02,221
Bekah: my daughter once said she
was like, I either want to be a

485
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:04,771
princess, a cat or a doctor. And
I was like, all right, well,

486
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:07,291
that

487
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,971
seems pretty easy, doctor.

488
00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:11,536
Dan: Go for cat. Cat seems like
a really good life. If you, I

489
00:24:11,536 --> 00:24:13,876
mean,

490
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:16,457
if you have a good home anyway,
I feel like if you're a cat, you

491
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:19,262
have it set, right? Um, yeah,
no, that's a great point. And

492
00:24:19,262 --> 00:24:22,067
you

493
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:26,836
know what, honestly, it, it, uh,
So when you were talking about

494
00:24:26,836 --> 00:24:29,176
your, um, you were in college
and the intro to CS class, and

495
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,516
sort

496
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:32,612
of made that choice to, you
know, that's an experience, a

497
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:33,707
lot of

498
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:34,921
people have too. And like,
you're talking about what do you

499
00:24:34,921 --> 00:24:36,135
want to

500
00:24:36,136 --> 00:24:37,771
be when you grow up when you're
a kid, but that question like

501
00:24:37,771 --> 00:24:39,406
hangs

502
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:41,761
around forever. You know,
there's not like a thing and

503
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:44,116
that there's

504
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,727
not a point where that can, you
know, maybe you've found

505
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:48,669
something that you're fine with
or whatever, but. As we've

506
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:50,611
proved

507
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:52,741
possible to change. Right. Um,
but that experience of like

508
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,421
going

509
00:24:54,422 --> 00:24:56,507
into freshman year is so
fraught, that sort of stuff, you

510
00:24:56,507 --> 00:24:58,592
know,

511
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:02,294
and, um, those. It's funny how
those, I just keep thinking

512
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:05,666
about

513
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:08,007
your friend telling you that you
had to be smart to do this or

514
00:25:08,247 --> 00:25:10,467
whatever. And you know, when
you're a freshman and

515
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,257
everything's overwhelming. And I
feel like you're still probably

516
00:25:13,257 --> 00:25:14,262
like trying to take stuff off of
the buffet. It's just a

517
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,267
different

518
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:17,757
buffet. Right. And, uh, how,
like one, one sentence, like

519
00:25:17,757 --> 00:25:20,247
that can,

520
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,722
can change, like what you, you
know, your whole life really,

521
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,717
you

522
00:25:24,717 --> 00:25:29,257
know, like, uh, I don't really
have a point other than I was

523
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:30,106
just, I just keep thinking
about, you know, I just keep

524
00:25:30,106 --> 00:25:30,945
coming back

525
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,076
to that. Cause I, I mean, I had
experiences like that in college

526
00:25:33,076 --> 00:25:35,281
too, you know? Uh, and I changed
majors a few times and um, all

527
00:25:35,281 --> 00:25:37,486
of

528
00:25:37,487 --> 00:25:40,426
that stuff, including being
computer science major and I

529
00:25:40,426 --> 00:25:43,037
changed to English instead of
Japanese. So it was a little

530
00:25:43,037 --> 00:25:46,517
easier for me. Although, you
know, now that I think of it, I

531
00:25:46,517 --> 00:25:48,331
was signed up for a Japanese
class, uh, like first semester

532
00:25:48,331 --> 00:25:50,145
of

533
00:25:50,146 --> 00:25:52,164
freshman. Yeah. Well, I didn't,
I didn't know. I dropped that

534
00:25:52,164 --> 00:25:54,182
class

535
00:25:54,182 --> 00:25:58,291
very quickly because it was, it
didn't work. It didn't work out

536
00:25:58,291 --> 00:25:59,866
well for me, but, um, I feel
like it might've been early in

537
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:01,441
the

538
00:26:01,442 --> 00:26:04,201
morning too. I don't know. It
wasn't the right fit

539
00:26:04,592 --> 00:26:07,531
Yolanda: Morning classes are
hard regardless of the subject.

540
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,876
Dan: Um, I'm trying to find like
a point of what I was saying.

541
00:26:10,876 --> 00:26:12,751
Um,

542
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:13,966
I don't really have a point
other than I was affected by

543
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:15,151
that, by,

544
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:16,331
by your story. And it's just
like an interesting thing to

545
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:17,490
think

546
00:26:17,491 --> 00:26:17,761
about.

547
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:21,186
Bekah: It's true. I mean, the
things that you say to other

548
00:26:21,186 --> 00:26:23,346
people matter, and it might be
an off the cuff thing, but you

549
00:26:23,346 --> 00:26:25,506
know,

550
00:26:25,957 --> 00:26:29,676
we talked about this in Virtual
Coffee, like the impact of your

551
00:26:29,676 --> 00:26:32,076
words does matter. And I
remember I had a student my

552
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:34,476
first or

553
00:26:34,477 --> 00:26:36,681
second semester teaching
freshman English, and I always

554
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:38,885
tried to

555
00:26:38,886 --> 00:26:43,926
write something positive on
everybody's paper. And he, I

556
00:26:43,926 --> 00:26:49,531
think was. Taking this course
for this was not his first time

557
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:52,981
taking the course. Um, and he
came up to me after class and he

558
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:57,241
said, thank you so much. For
saying whatever. Nice thing I

559
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,011
said, he was like, I have never
had any teacher say anything

560
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:00,781
nice

561
00:27:00,781 --> 00:27:04,021
about my writing. It's always
been, you know, red marks or

562
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:09,991
negative comments and that kind
of thing just made such a huge

563
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:12,391
impression because you know,
one, one small remark and it

564
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:14,791
made a

565
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:18,932
total difference in the way that
he communicated and his

566
00:27:18,932 --> 00:27:23,326
investment in. And I think that
positive or negative that's,

567
00:27:23,326 --> 00:27:25,106
that's what it does. And, you
know, unfortunately I think

568
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:26,886
women

569
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:31,596
have experienced a lot of
negativity and gatekeeping in

570
00:27:31,747 --> 00:27:34,161
more scientific or technical
fields. Um, at least many

571
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:36,575
stories

572
00:27:36,606 --> 00:27:38,796
that I've heard. So, um, it's
definitely something that, that

573
00:27:38,796 --> 00:27:40,986
I

574
00:27:40,987 --> 00:27:42,681
hope gets better. And I
appreciate people telling

575
00:27:42,681 --> 00:27:44,375
stories

576
00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:51,946
about that. So we're aware of
that kind of thing. Um, so 100

577
00:27:51,946 --> 00:27:56,086
devs, isn't the only program you
did, right? You did. You also do

578
00:27:56,086 --> 00:27:56,747
Collab Lab.

579
00:27:57,041 --> 00:28:02,261
Yolanda: I did. Yes. So I was in
Collab Lab summer of last year

580
00:28:02,471 --> 00:28:05,711
from July to August, June to
August, something like that. So

581
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:10,271
yeah, another community I am
happy to be in and help out. So

582
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:14,922
love that. Love that team
people, everyone.

583
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:20,011
Bekah: Do you want to talk a
little bit about what does.

584
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:25,132
Yolanda: Yeah. Um, oh, I hope I
do justice. Uh, it's an awesome,

585
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:32,061
awesome group or organization,
um, where they help, uh, people

586
00:28:32,061 --> 00:28:35,571
who are new to the industry and
teach them how to collaborate in

587
00:28:35,571 --> 00:28:41,372
a team on a project. So you are
given a. actually you, you have

588
00:28:41,372 --> 00:28:45,182
to apply to, to join Collab Lab,
and once they accept your

589
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,236
application, then you are put in
a team of four new developers

590
00:28:47,236 --> 00:28:49,290
and

591
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:53,491
then about two to three mentors.
And then it's a eight week, I

592
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:56,311
think. Process or journey where
you create a react app. It's

593
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:59,131
like

594
00:28:59,132 --> 00:29:01,951
a shopping cart. Everybody does
the same thing. It's the same

595
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:05,432
application throughout other
teams. And then from start to

596
00:29:05,432 --> 00:29:09,031
finish, you build your, your
application. So, um, and then it

597
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:14,041
just kind of every week we go
through kind of what we've

598
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:18,932
learned. Um, oops, hold on.
Sorry. Let me try to think what

599
00:29:18,932 --> 00:29:21,864
else. And then every week you
are paired up with another dev.

600
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:24,796
So

601
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:28,547
it's like you plus another dev
and you work on this small task

602
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:30,451
that's been given to you. And we
go through like the get hub

603
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:32,175
repo,

604
00:29:32,747 --> 00:29:34,096
you're assigned the task and
then there's like acceptance

605
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:35,445
criteria.

606
00:29:35,656 --> 00:29:40,067
So they try to mimic a real
life's work scenario. So in that

607
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:45,132
week, time span, we have. Try to
complete that task, um, and push

608
00:29:45,132 --> 00:29:47,951
it. So the mentors could take a
look at the, do a code review,

609
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:49,856
and then we also do a code
review of our partners or the

610
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:51,701
other

611
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:56,551
teams. Code. And then they teach
us like how to do a proper code

612
00:29:56,551 --> 00:29:57,961
review. You can't just say
everything looks good, thumbs

613
00:29:57,961 --> 00:29:59,371
up,

614
00:29:59,402 --> 00:30:03,481
you know, try to give a better
feedback. Like, oh, what does

615
00:30:03,481 --> 00:30:06,422
this do? Or I don't understand
this. Can you explain it better

616
00:30:07,051 --> 00:30:11,102
type of comments? And then if it
looks good, then the mentor will

617
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:14,701
give like a thumbs up kind of
thing. And then, um, we push it

618
00:30:14,701 --> 00:30:17,058
to, to that main branch and. And
then you, the second week you

619
00:30:17,058 --> 00:30:19,415
get

620
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:22,207
paired with a different dev. So
it gives you that collaboration

621
00:30:22,207 --> 00:30:23,931
and getting used to working
with, um, with different people.

622
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:25,655
So the

623
00:30:25,836 --> 00:30:30,096
team I'm on was on, was a
fantastic team. Um, I wasn't

624
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:33,037
strong in react, so they
definitely helped me get, uh,

625
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:36,336
gain a better understanding and
kind of teach me through it. Um,

626
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:40,267
and I just learned what AC was,
which was acceptance criteria,

627
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:44,346
you know? Uh, and then when you
do the hub, there's like a

628
00:30:44,346 --> 00:30:47,276
template and then try to give
it. Nice structure of when, um,

629
00:30:47,276 --> 00:30:50,206
when

630
00:30:50,207 --> 00:30:53,057
you commit the code. So it's not
just code, you're explaining

631
00:30:53,057 --> 00:30:55,517
exactly what you're committing,
you know, instead of trying to

632
00:30:55,517 --> 00:30:58,067
have the other people guess what
you're committing. So that was

633
00:30:58,067 --> 00:31:01,396
really nice. And then, um, they
talked about accessibility and,

634
00:31:01,396 --> 00:31:03,886
uh, it, it was it's, it's an
awesome program. Um, I hope I

635
00:31:03,886 --> 00:31:06,376
did

636
00:31:06,376 --> 00:31:09,856
it justice. It was like a really
terrible explanation.

637
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:12,317
Bekah: no, I think he did a
really good job and we'll have a

638
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:14,491
link to it so everybody can
check it out afterwards. Um,

639
00:31:14,491 --> 00:31:16,665
we've had

640
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,666
a lot of Virtual Coffee members
go through Collab Lab, and I

641
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:24,287
really appreciate that. Um, The
collaboration that's focused on

642
00:31:24,287 --> 00:31:30,196
because I, my bootcamp
experiences, um, similar issuers

643
00:31:30,196 --> 00:31:34,307
in that it was like self paced.
Um, I was, I was really by

644
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:37,022
myself. Um, there wasn't a lot
of like one-on-one meetings or,

645
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:39,737
um,

646
00:31:39,886 --> 00:31:44,541
any collaboration happening,
which. And made it doable for me

647
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:49,642
at the time. But, um, like in
retrospect, I feel like I needed

648
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:53,031
to make more of an effort to do
those types of collaborations,

649
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:56,751
because then it was like kind of
a learning curve to figure out

650
00:31:57,021 --> 00:32:00,201
how to communicate about things
and when to communicate about

651
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:03,499
things. So, um, do you feel.
That collaboration. What, what

652
00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:06,797
was the

653
00:32:06,797 --> 00:32:11,537
learning curve from where you
were when you started? Um, to

654
00:32:11,686 --> 00:32:15,856
have those good quality
collaborative meetings.

655
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:22,227
Yolanda: Oh, good question. Um,
I, I was going to apply, I think

656
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:26,582
it was. Spring cohort, um, the
beginning of the year. And I

657
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:29,852
think that was after a month of
just learning JavaScript. I

658
00:32:29,852 --> 00:32:33,152
reached out to another Virtual
Coffee member, um, and, uh,

659
00:32:33,332 --> 00:32:35,102
either she applied or she just
went through it and, uh, she

660
00:32:35,102 --> 00:32:36,872
told

661
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:39,224
me, Hey, Try the next one,
because you should have some

662
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,576
sort

663
00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:45,356
of a good foundation before.
Cause they Collab Lab does not

664
00:32:45,356 --> 00:32:48,237
teach you how to code. It just
teaches you how to collaborate.

665
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:53,396
So having that coding foundation
is, um, is vital. So then I

666
00:32:53,396 --> 00:32:56,846
pushed it until summer. So I
started a 100Devs, October of

667
00:32:56,846 --> 00:32:59,773
2020. Then I got into Collab
Lab. Let's say like July. So.

668
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:02,700
Like

669
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,771
eight months, seven, eight
months. Sorry I had account,

670
00:33:06,301 --> 00:33:07,996
before, you know, I, I mean,
even then I didn't feel

671
00:33:07,996 --> 00:33:09,691
comfortable. I

672
00:33:09,692 --> 00:33:12,632
didn't think I was gonna get
accepted to tell you the truth.

673
00:33:12,662 --> 00:33:15,692
Um, then an, uh, another a
hundred Devore, she said, Hey,

674
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:18,811
you gotta shoot your shots. You
don't know until you try. Cause

675
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:20,611
I, I have this like very low
confidence, you know, I was

676
00:33:20,611 --> 00:33:22,411
like,

677
00:33:22,442 --> 00:33:24,017
I'm not good enough or I don't
need another year before I, I

678
00:33:24,017 --> 00:33:25,592
can

679
00:33:25,592 --> 00:33:29,251
even do X, Y, and Z. So she's
like, Hey, if it doesn't work.

680
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,346
There's there's no negative
impact. Like you just try again

681
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:35,747
at the next cohort. I'm like,
okay. Yeah, there's nothing

682
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:40,396
wrong. There's no consequences.
So I applied in lo and behold, I

683
00:33:40,396 --> 00:33:44,596
got accepted. So this thing to
that person, um, that helped me

684
00:33:44,596 --> 00:33:49,096
out and pushed me for that. So I
think I had like eight months

685
00:33:49,517 --> 00:33:53,237
experience before I applied to
Collab Lab. Um, and then maybe a

686
00:33:53,237 --> 00:33:56,926
month of react experience. So
very little, very, very baby

687
00:33:56,926 --> 00:33:58,457
chick stage of that.

688
00:34:00,336 --> 00:34:03,426
Bekah: Do you feel like it
helped you when you moved on?

689
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:08,766
Yolanda: It helped me gain a
better understanding of how

690
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:13,117
collaboration works. Um, in a
100Devs, we did work on a team

691
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:16,086
project, so that, that was
helpful, but it's a lot of

692
00:34:16,476 --> 00:34:18,131
newbies as well, you know,
working on a project to think

693
00:34:18,131 --> 00:34:19,786
the

694
00:34:19,797 --> 00:34:23,416
other. So there was a lot of,
um, I think this is what we're

695
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:26,146
supposed to do kind of thing. Or
like, how do we share the code?

696
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:30,617
Or, you know, if, if one change,
do we just share it through like

697
00:34:30,646 --> 00:34:33,369
Google docs? So it's still a lot
of. The process kind of, what

698
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:36,092
did

699
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:37,981
we do? I don't get it. Um, so
it's a lot of builders with

700
00:34:37,981 --> 00:34:39,870
tools

701
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:41,026
and we're just eager to build
and we're like, okay, so what do

702
00:34:41,026 --> 00:34:42,181
we

703
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:44,882
do now? What's a blueprint. You
know, it was like, oh, okay.

704
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,431
Maybe we should do that first
kind of thing. And that's how it

705
00:34:47,431 --> 00:34:49,862
felt. And then with Collab Lab,
it's like, okay, you guys, this

706
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:53,797
is the. You know, this, these
are your roles. This is our

707
00:34:53,856 --> 00:34:56,976
expectations of you, you know,
and this is you should finish

708
00:34:56,976 --> 00:34:58,701
this task, you know? And then
before you go on to the next

709
00:34:58,701 --> 00:35:00,426
one,

710
00:35:00,996 --> 00:35:02,271
don't worry about this. You
know, don't worry about the

711
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:03,546
color of

712
00:35:03,547 --> 00:35:05,976
the house yet. That's at the
very end, you know, worry about.

713
00:35:06,706 --> 00:35:10,067
Building that I don't know, I'm
not a construction worker. So,

714
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:13,067
you know, like the foundation,
the frame, you know, focus on

715
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:16,036
that first. So for Collab Lab, I
was taught, you know, focus on

716
00:35:16,036 --> 00:35:20,416
the kind of the functionality.
Does it work, you know, versus

717
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:22,441
making it look pretty because
I'm a visual person. So I was

718
00:35:22,441 --> 00:35:24,196
like,

719
00:35:24,226 --> 00:35:26,056
oh, maybe it needs to look this
way first. And they're like,

720
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:27,886
yes,

721
00:35:27,947 --> 00:35:29,372
it should look this way. Or it's
great to look that way, but

722
00:35:29,372 --> 00:35:30,797
maybe

723
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,844
we should focus on. Does it
work? Does this button work? No

724
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:34,891
matter

725
00:35:34,891 --> 00:35:38,731
how ugly it is, is it, does it
click? And if it clicks, does it

726
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:42,992
go to or do its thing? So, uh,
that's what I've learned is, oh,

727
00:35:42,992 --> 00:35:45,181
okay. There's this way of
building things, which was

728
00:35:45,362 --> 00:35:47,207
fantastic and very different
from what I've learned in a

729
00:35:47,207 --> 00:35:49,052
hundred

730
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:49,742
deaths. So.

731
00:35:51,657 --> 00:35:54,476
Dan: That's great. It sounds
like a, uh, a great learning

732
00:35:54,476 --> 00:35:57,777
experience and something that I
would just having. I mean, I

733
00:35:57,777 --> 00:36:00,927
haven't ever done it obviously,
but like I would encourage

734
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:04,071
anybody to do because, um,
that's sort of the. You know,

735
00:36:04,071 --> 00:36:06,766
learning

736
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:10,786
like actual coding is important
obviously, but there's so much

737
00:36:10,786 --> 00:36:13,666
that goes into a job, um, or a
project or anything like that,

738
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:16,276
that isn't just writing code,
you know? And, um, there's, you

739
00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:18,886
know,

740
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:22,097
lots of people have lots of, uh,
trouble, like getting kind of

741
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:25,036
started up with any project or
with, um, you know, in a new

742
00:36:25,036 --> 00:36:28,456
company if they don't have this
sort of experience and, um,

743
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:32,686
having that confidence to, you
know, to know like, okay, I know

744
00:36:32,686 --> 00:36:36,226
how to do. Code review. You know
what I mean? I know how to do,

745
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:37,857
uh, you know, pull requests,
even all that, all of us, all

746
00:36:37,857 --> 00:36:38,887
this

747
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:41,507
stuff. I know, you know, I just,
that, that it's like something

748
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:45,706
that, know, to go through this
level of practice at it, you

749
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:49,186
know, it gives you that like the
full confidence. I don't even

750
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:51,166
worry about it anymore. Right.
It almost becomes second nature.

751
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:54,376
Right. And so, so like, if you
go into a job interview, um, for

752
00:36:54,376 --> 00:36:57,467
instance, you don't have to like
sweat about that part. You know,

753
00:36:57,737 --> 00:36:59,867
anything you don't have to sweat
about it. It's good. And I think

754
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:02,626
usually like a job interview is,
can probably tell like when

755
00:37:02,626 --> 00:37:04,487
you're sweating, when you're not
about, about certain things, you

756
00:37:04,487 --> 00:37:08,177
know, and, uh, you know, but
work with people, it's, it's an

757
00:37:08,177 --> 00:37:11,272
important skill and it's hard
to. I had to like display on a

758
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:14,367
resume

759
00:37:14,547 --> 00:37:18,737
to, you know, so that cloud lab,
you know, uh, completing that

760
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:22,137
Collab Lab thing is, is like a
nice, like, easy, easy to point

761
00:37:22,137 --> 00:37:24,027
to, you know, thing. Oh, that's
really cool.

762
00:37:24,856 --> 00:37:25,036
Yolanda: Yeah.

763
00:37:27,226 --> 00:37:29,146
Bekah: I was just going to say,
I think that you've done a great

764
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:33,077
job, like constructing your
learning, how to code journey

765
00:37:33,137 --> 00:37:36,317
through all of the opportunities
that you've done and you know,

766
00:37:36,317 --> 00:37:37,322
all of the skills that you've
learned, it feels like you've

767
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:38,327
got

768
00:37:38,327 --> 00:37:42,496
a very well-rounded experience
coming out of that.

769
00:37:44,117 --> 00:37:45,871
Yolanda: Yeah, I think so. I
hope so. I mean better than when

770
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:47,625
I try

771
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:53,976
to do it on my own, so I cannot
complain it's um, you know, I

772
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:57,512
just. I wish I knew it was going
to take this long, then I would

773
00:37:57,512 --> 00:38:01,411
have really took my time with it
and just kind of savor the taste

774
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:03,256
instead of trying to rush and
try everything or do everything.

775
00:38:03,256 --> 00:38:05,101
But,

776
00:38:05,101 --> 00:38:08,536
um, yeah, but then it's just
been helpful because awful, you

777
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,971
know,

778
00:38:11,972 --> 00:38:13,786
the, you know, the situation
that we're all put in with COVID

779
00:38:13,786 --> 00:38:15,600
and I

780
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:20,572
don't know if I would be where
I'm at. If it, if that didn't

781
00:38:20,572 --> 00:38:22,177
happen, because, you know, when
I try to learn how to code, I

782
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:23,782
was

783
00:38:23,782 --> 00:38:25,717
working, you know, 30, 40 hours
and try to do coding on the

784
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:27,652
side,

785
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:29,856
but with COVID I was able to
focus, you know, and, and try

786
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:32,001
to,

787
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:33,816
you know, find the community
that I felt comfortable in. And,

788
00:38:33,816 --> 00:38:35,631
um,

789
00:38:35,811 --> 00:38:38,556
and then just kind of cut off
here. I am. It's just, it's,

790
00:38:38,556 --> 00:38:41,301
it's

791
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:44,626
healthy and it's very helpful to
have the. Free communities too,

792
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:48,947
you know, Virtual Coffee, a
100Devs Collab Lab, you know, it

793
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:51,737
wasn't out of my pocket. So the
money that I was able to save a

794
00:38:51,737 --> 00:38:55,487
lot goes through, you know,
bills, food, or, you know,

795
00:38:55,487 --> 00:38:57,977
emergency whatever. So it's
just, um, it's really nice that

796
00:38:57,977 --> 00:39:00,467
this,

797
00:39:00,496 --> 00:39:01,771
in this day and age, there's
still a lot of people who want

798
00:39:01,771 --> 00:39:03,046
to

799
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:07,487
help other people without, you
know, with the kindness of their

800
00:39:07,487 --> 00:39:10,157
heart and their time, you know?
Cause it's not, it's not an easy

801
00:39:10,157 --> 00:39:12,317
thing to do and yeah.

802
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,896
Dan: Yeah, no, that's important.
It's just like you're helping

803
00:39:17,907 --> 00:39:20,427
with, um, a hundred deaths,
right? Uh, you're volunteering

804
00:39:20,427 --> 00:39:23,246
with them and stuff. It's always
cool to be able to, like, once

805
00:39:23,246 --> 00:39:28,166
you have some amount of time or
space available to yourself, to,

806
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,531
you know, to be able to give
back in ways since it's neat.

807
00:39:30,531 --> 00:39:32,896
That's

808
00:39:32,896 --> 00:39:34,217
cool that, uh, oh, go ahead.

809
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:38,086
Bekah: I was gonna say too, like
you have done note taking for us

810
00:39:38,146 --> 00:39:42,166
to at Virtual Coffee and you're,
you're usually there, you are on

811
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:44,446
the west coast, but you are
there 6:00 AM your time

812
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:46,726
frequently. Um,

813
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:53,356
and I, I just, I love to see it.
I it's it's so, you know, um, I

814
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:57,016
know like what a Testament it is
to your character, that you are

815
00:39:57,047 --> 00:40:00,976
so willing to give back and to
support the communities that

816
00:40:00,976 --> 00:40:01,456
you've been apart.

817
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,653
Yolanda: It's because, you know,
I, uh, I feel comfortable being

818
00:40:07,653 --> 00:40:09,994
in the computer community, you
know, Virtual Coffee from the

819
00:40:09,994 --> 00:40:13,083
get-go. Um, I think I messaged
you because like, it was like

820
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:17,043
love at first sight. That first
meeting, I, it was very, it was

821
00:40:17,043 --> 00:40:21,599
very nice and I mean, I probably
really do. Get involved with

822
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,308
first of all, coffee, until
months later, I know like

823
00:40:23,308 --> 00:40:25,017
Noranda

824
00:40:25,018 --> 00:40:27,418
would like edge me. Like he was
like, say, Hey, think Yolanda?

825
00:40:27,418 --> 00:40:29,818
Or

826
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:33,148
like, I want you to, you know,
have a conversation too. Cause I

827
00:40:33,148 --> 00:40:34,798
was mainly a fly on the wall and
every meetup, you know, it's

828
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:36,448
just

829
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:39,809
like, I just want to listen
because I feel at that time I

830
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:44,219
can't contract. Yeah. As silly
as it was, I felt like, oh yeah,

831
00:40:44,518 --> 00:40:47,668
there's this new, I'm the new
person. I, I can't contribute to

832
00:40:47,668 --> 00:40:51,449
this discussion. There's I can't
say anything. There's no vital

833
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,693
information. So I'm just going
to keep my mouth shut and just,

834
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:53,937
and

835
00:40:53,938 --> 00:40:58,349
just listen. And that was for a
few months. Um, but with the

836
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:00,464
consistency, I think other
members that me and they're

837
00:41:00,464 --> 00:41:02,579
like,

838
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:05,489
Hey, so what do you think you'll
want to, or, Hey, Yolanda, you

839
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:08,489
know, good to see you on here.
And because of that, and then

840
00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:12,478
reaching out to me, kind of
putting me on the spot, kind of

841
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:14,413
broke the ice. At least for me,
it helped me get more

842
00:41:14,413 --> 00:41:15,957
comfortable

843
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:18,898
and then finally took the plunge
of like, okay, I think I could

844
00:41:18,898 --> 00:41:22,018
help out with the note-taking. I
think it was like Meg needed a

845
00:41:22,018 --> 00:41:24,283
help or something in one of the
rooms. And like, I think I can

846
00:41:24,283 --> 00:41:26,548
do

847
00:41:26,548 --> 00:41:26,728
this.

848
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:32,608
Bekah: Yeah. So I want to, um,
back up a little bit kind of, I

849
00:41:32,608 --> 00:41:36,179
don't know if it's backing up,
but you mentioned that your mom

850
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:38,893
too. Um, and we talked about
this journey and, um, we all

851
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:41,607
your know

852
00:41:41,608 --> 00:41:44,639
that it's challenging to be a
parent and to be working,

853
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:47,294
especially during COVID times
and, and learning. So I feel

854
00:41:47,294 --> 00:41:49,889
like

855
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:54,591
anytime we can hear the story
of. You know, how you survived,

856
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:59,233
um,

857
00:41:59,264 --> 00:42:04,273
being a parent and learning, um,
or working through things. I

858
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:07,364
think that that story looks a
lot different than, than other

859
00:42:07,364 --> 00:42:11,623
people's stories who, you know,
might not have all of the same

860
00:42:11,623 --> 00:42:15,224
responsibilities. So what do you
think, w what, how was that for

861
00:42:15,224 --> 00:42:15,914
you as a mom?

862
00:42:16,623 --> 00:42:19,308
Yolanda: Ooh. It was tough. It
is tough. It's still tough. It's

863
00:42:19,308 --> 00:42:21,993
not

864
00:42:21,994 --> 00:42:26,923
easy. I mean, I'm very fortunate
that I do have my husband, you

865
00:42:26,923 --> 00:42:32,653
know, and he does help out, but
it's, it's just, it was, it is,

866
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:36,494
it's difficult. It's a lot of
trying to figure out when can I

867
00:42:36,494 --> 00:42:41,054
study? You know, I have, at that
time two year old saying like,

868
00:42:41,054 --> 00:42:42,748
Hey, play with me. You know,
like let's play together because

869
00:42:42,748 --> 00:42:44,442
he

870
00:42:44,443 --> 00:42:48,403
sees me here, you know, on the
computer at home. So it's, you

871
00:42:48,403 --> 00:42:51,523
know, play time, no matter how
hard I try, he's like, okay,

872
00:42:51,523 --> 00:42:54,509
give, give me five minutes. You
know, but they don't, they don't

873
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:56,893
understand time. You say five,
they think it's like now. So,

874
00:42:56,893 --> 00:42:59,277
um,

875
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:01,378
and then, you know, it's just
trying to adjust the schedule. I

876
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:05,668
remember trying to wake up, you
know, five in the morning to try

877
00:43:05,668 --> 00:43:08,308
to learn how to code. And then
of course my little one, um,

878
00:43:08,308 --> 00:43:10,948
three

879
00:43:10,949 --> 00:43:13,094
at that time he would wake up
and he wouldn't see me or he'll

880
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:15,239
look

881
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:17,893
for me. So. I couldn't really
code. Cause then he wants to,

882
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:20,547
you

883
00:43:20,548 --> 00:43:22,033
know, I can't keep them up at
5:00 AM. He still needs to

884
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:23,518
sleep,

885
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,453
so, and I'll go back in bed and
try to put him back to sleep.

886
00:43:25,453 --> 00:43:27,388
And

887
00:43:27,389 --> 00:43:31,739
then when I try to, I think I
thought I ninja my way out, but

888
00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:35,938
oh no, he wakes up like five
minutes later. It's like, okay,

889
00:43:35,969 --> 00:43:39,809
that didn't work. And then I'll
try to stay up late to learn how

890
00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:44,998
to code. that doesn't work
because he wants mommy to be in

891
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:48,088
bed with them to go to sleep.
I'll try to ask my husband and

892
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:49,693
he'll try to help out, but it's
always like, no, but I want

893
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,298
mommy

894
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,289
and I'm like, mommy's busy. So I
will try that. And then I'll do

895
00:43:55,289 --> 00:43:57,561
like 11, 12 o'clock. Um, at
night one o'clock trying to

896
00:43:57,561 --> 00:43:59,833
code, but

897
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,873
then I'm already tired. So was
it effective? I don't know. It

898
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:03,913
felt

899
00:44:03,914 --> 00:44:06,434
like it reminded me of college
where you look at the textbook

900
00:44:06,943 --> 00:44:09,193
and you're reading that same
paragraph and you're like, oh

901
00:44:09,224 --> 00:44:11,893
crap. I think I just read that
paragraph. Okay. I'm going to

902
00:44:11,893 --> 00:44:15,134
focus. Let me read it again, but
nothing stick. And you're like,

903
00:44:15,164 --> 00:44:19,454
oh, what did I just read? So it
felt like that for, for many

904
00:44:19,454 --> 00:44:22,333
months, just trying to find ways
to. everything. And then I had

905
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:25,212
to

906
00:44:25,213 --> 00:44:29,023
talk with my husband and saying,
Hey, is it okay if I cut back on

907
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:33,253
work and focus on school or, you
know, Leon's class, because the

908
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:37,034
end goal is to make that career
change. And, you know, luckily

909
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:41,474
his job wasn't affected by the
COVID. So he still, he was still

910
00:44:41,474 --> 00:44:44,069
working. So he said, yeah, yeah,
we can do that. So, um, and

911
00:44:44,069 --> 00:44:46,664
then,

912
00:44:46,664 --> 00:44:51,284
you know, and also fortunately
we are able to put my kid in

913
00:44:51,284 --> 00:44:55,063
daycares. You know, just
part-time. So we did that and

914
00:44:55,063 --> 00:44:58,333
that all those pieces kind of
fell together and it helped me

915
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:01,393
out personally. So I was very
fortunate and, you know,

916
00:45:01,423 --> 00:45:05,264
supportive husband didn't lose
his job, had daycare. So this

917
00:45:05,264 --> 00:45:07,528
kind of stars semi aligned. And
I was able to kind of learn

918
00:45:07,528 --> 00:45:09,792
through

919
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:13,454
that, but it wasn't easy. A lot
of nights that I cried a lot of

920
00:45:13,454 --> 00:45:18,344
nights. I mean argued a lot of
nights that I not even nights,

921
00:45:18,373 --> 00:45:20,758
just days, I just want to scream
into the void, like why? And,

922
00:45:20,758 --> 00:45:23,143
uh,

923
00:45:23,143 --> 00:45:27,313
you know, thought process of
like, if I didn't have a kid, I

924
00:45:27,313 --> 00:45:30,403
probably would've gotten this
earlier, better, faster, you

925
00:45:30,403 --> 00:45:35,168
know? And. of look at him and he
smiles and gives me a hug. I'm

926
00:45:35,168 --> 00:45:37,929
like, damn it. Why did I think
of that? You know, terrible

927
00:45:37,929 --> 00:45:41,168
thoughts. And it's like, okay,
it's worth it. He's he doesn't

928
00:45:41,168 --> 00:45:44,468
know any better. So it's a lot
of back and forth. Like I wish,

929
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:47,768
I

930
00:45:47,768 --> 00:45:49,943
wish I didn't change my mind
back in college, but then I

931
00:45:49,943 --> 00:45:52,118
wouldn't

932
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:54,369
have taught abroad. Then I
wouldn't have had built those

933
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:59,349
friendships and relationships.
And it's just, I don't know. But

934
00:45:59,349 --> 00:46:05,503
being a mom is hard. That's
just, that was my rant. Sorry.

935
00:46:08,653 --> 00:46:13,768
Dan: Yeah, it's. It's hard to, I
mean, definitely hard to learn.

936
00:46:13,798 --> 00:46:18,418
You know, it's hard to really do
any development work when, you

937
00:46:18,418 --> 00:46:20,969
know, when you're tired or for
me, I guess, personally, but

938
00:46:20,998 --> 00:46:23,248
like, I feel like this is pretty
common, but you know, when your

939
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:25,768
brain, when you're tired, your
brain doesn't work quite at its

940
00:46:25,798 --> 00:46:31,048
like its normal level and um,
parenting is being tired a lot

941
00:46:31,918 --> 00:46:33,988
and you know, it's just like,
it's hard. It's, it's hard. So

942
00:46:33,988 --> 00:46:36,058
I,

943
00:46:36,398 --> 00:46:40,429
I appreciate you sharing with us
cause it's. I've had a lot of

944
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:42,539
similar experiences. It's a lot
of late nights and a lot of

945
00:46:42,838 --> 00:46:43,813
yelling and stuff, not going
through your brain that you

946
00:46:43,813 --> 00:46:44,788
think

947
00:46:44,789 --> 00:46:48,478
should be going through. Like,
you know, I should be able to

948
00:46:48,478 --> 00:46:51,688
figure this out kind of thing.
Right. And I'm like, oh wait, I

949
00:46:51,688 --> 00:46:53,153
was up for, I was only asleep
for like two hours last night

950
00:46:53,153 --> 00:46:54,618
and

951
00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:57,329
they maybe that's why, you know,
uh, so

952
00:46:58,264 --> 00:47:00,784
Bekah: And I think, you know,
it's hard, I've talked to a lot

953
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:05,164
of moms who have felt those
frustrations and you, you see

954
00:47:05,193 --> 00:47:08,583
stories on Twitter or wherever
where people are flying through

955
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:11,253
things, and then you play the
comparison game. Like, well, how

956
00:47:11,253 --> 00:47:13,158
come they're there? And I'm not
there. And you know, I can't

957
00:47:13,158 --> 00:47:15,063
tell

958
00:47:15,063 --> 00:47:16,338
you how many times I've talked
to another mom who was

959
00:47:16,338 --> 00:47:17,613
struggling in

960
00:47:17,614 --> 00:47:21,478
that journey. Like. One staying
up late and I'm waking up early

961
00:47:21,478 --> 00:47:23,518
and I'm putting in all this time
and it's still not sticking. I'm

962
00:47:23,518 --> 00:47:26,639
like how many hours of sleep are
you getting a night for? Well,

963
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:30,599
it's, it's not going to stick.
And you know, you said something

964
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:33,088
earlier about like, I, I wish I
would have like savored the

965
00:47:33,088 --> 00:47:36,719
journey more or something like
that. And I think that there is

966
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,259
this tendency to want to rush
through it, or, you know, these

967
00:47:40,259 --> 00:47:43,259
boot campers get it done in 12
weeks or whatever. I should be

968
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:50,483
able to get it done in 12 weeks.
No, that's not ideal. And it, it

969
00:47:50,503 --> 00:47:55,423
doesn't acknowledge the
challenges that, that we face in

970
00:47:55,483 --> 00:47:59,503
our lives, um, to be able to do
that. Like Dan you're saying

971
00:47:59,503 --> 00:48:04,139
like, your brain just cannot,
uh, be a spot. When you're not

972
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:07,858
getting enough sleep at night,
it's, it's not, it's a

973
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:12,028
physiological thing. You can't
break that you can't change that

974
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:18,059
part of of it. And So you know,
putting a focus on like take the

975
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:23,099
time to like pace yourself and
learn what you're doing, um, and

976
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:27,264
savor those moments of the
journey. Yeah. I say this, like

977
00:48:27,293 --> 00:48:30,324
in retrospect, but I know had
somebody said the same thing to

978
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,393
me while I was going through it,
I'd be like, yeah, sure.

979
00:48:32,393 --> 00:48:34,838
Whatever. Like, I just need to
be done with this and get on

980
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:37,283
with

981
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:42,114
the real life where things are
easier is not easier. Like I

982
00:48:42,114 --> 00:48:46,074
thought bootcamp was hard. Wait
a minute. Like this is, this is

983
00:48:46,074 --> 00:48:48,354
harder suddenly and I'm
terrified. So, um, there are

984
00:48:48,354 --> 00:48:50,634
just

985
00:48:50,634 --> 00:48:53,479
so many other factors. All
right. Somebody had once said,

986
00:48:53,479 --> 00:48:56,324
you know,

987
00:48:56,353 --> 00:49:01,063
bootcamps should have, I dunno,
like a warning or something to

988
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,284
say that this is going to put
intense pressure on your

989
00:49:03,284 --> 00:49:05,818
relationship. And a lot of
people break up during this time

990
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:08,352
because

991
00:49:08,353 --> 00:49:13,514
there is so much stress and
pressure And nobody talks about

992
00:49:13,514 --> 00:49:17,108
that cause like, oh, did you
feel. Did your project get done?

993
00:49:17,259 --> 00:49:22,628
Did you get hired? Not like how
were you impacted in your life

994
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,758
outside of work in learning? And
so I think it's, you know, I

995
00:49:24,758 --> 00:49:26,857
very

996
00:49:26,858 --> 00:49:31,509
much appreciate you sharing all
of that because I think that I

997
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:37,449
wish that more people talked
about it. So people who are

998
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:41,739
coming into tech, like no,
there's a lot of pressure in

999
00:49:41,739 --> 00:49:42,398
these things.

1000
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:46,648
Yolanda: So much pressure
pressure on ourselves. I think,

1001
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:48,479
you know, and I keep comparing
myself to others, that

1002
00:49:48,479 --> 00:49:50,219
comparison

1003
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:52,588
game that you said, you know,
it's a terrible game to play.

1004
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:53,579
Terrible, terrible,

1005
00:49:53,643 --> 00:49:57,003
Bekah: I was compared to my self
to Kent C Dodds. I'm like, I

1006
00:49:57,003 --> 00:49:58,263
don't know, why that's not
really realistic, but I'm like,

1007
00:49:58,263 --> 00:49:59,523
why am I

1008
00:49:59,523 --> 00:50:00,273
not like that?

1009
00:50:01,594 --> 00:50:03,784
Yolanda: Yeah, it's just cause
you see it, you know, like all,

1010
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,718
you know, they, they did it,
they get it. Why can't I, you

1011
00:50:05,718 --> 00:50:07,502
know, or

1012
00:50:07,503 --> 00:50:12,554
I'll. Forget that I'm I'm uh, I
know mom, you know, and I have

1013
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:16,393
these obligations because I was
thinking in college, I didn't

1014
00:50:16,393 --> 00:50:19,994
struggle this much. Did I? Like
I got it. Like what? What's

1015
00:50:19,994 --> 00:50:23,143
different from college. And now
I'm in college was like 15 years

1016
00:50:23,143 --> 00:50:26,054
ago. I had to calculate it. It's
just like, you know, and back

1017
00:50:26,054 --> 00:50:29,264
then it was just me just like
there's no other there's no.

1018
00:50:30,148 --> 00:50:33,568
Little ones or, you know, people
that I have to kind of focus on

1019
00:50:33,568 --> 00:50:36,748
to take care of. So yeah, so I,
somebody told me like, compare

1020
00:50:36,748 --> 00:50:38,638
yourself and it was like, oh,
that's not fun. Like compare,

1021
00:50:38,638 --> 00:50:40,528
you

1022
00:50:40,528 --> 00:50:43,798
know, like it's just, I should,
and I get where they're saying.

1023
00:50:44,744 --> 00:50:48,463
I'm looking back a year ago.
Where was I? You know, what is

1024
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:51,643
today, March? And I think I was
still learning JavaScript and

1025
00:50:52,063 --> 00:50:55,364
probably feeling frustrated the
year ago saying I don't get it.

1026
00:50:55,393 --> 00:50:57,974
What, what do you mean I have to
do this? Like, it doesn't make

1027
00:50:57,974 --> 00:51:00,733
sense. And right now it still
doesn't make sense, but it's a

1028
00:51:00,733 --> 00:51:07,139
little, a little, I get a better
idea. Um, Yeah, somebody, I, I

1029
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:09,688
try to do that and he's like,
okay, where was I before? You

1030
00:51:09,688 --> 00:51:14,128
know, where was I yesterday? Did
I have a least 1% of improvement

1031
00:51:14,128 --> 00:51:15,433
today? Kind of thing. So I think
that was like through also

1032
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:16,738
atomic

1033
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:18,538
habits, you know, just
microscopic improvement and

1034
00:51:18,538 --> 00:51:20,337
focus

1035
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:22,123
on that. So I think that helps
me out as well. Just the tiniest

1036
00:51:22,123 --> 00:51:23,908
of

1037
00:51:23,909 --> 00:51:26,909
the tiny victory. So if I could
just put in, you know, five

1038
00:51:26,909 --> 00:51:31,523
minutes of whatever learning,
yay. That's my victory. One step

1039
00:51:31,643 --> 00:51:35,753
tiny step forward, instead of
saying, oh, I only spent five

1040
00:51:35,753 --> 00:51:39,083
minutes. You know, it's like try
to change that mindset, which is

1041
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:42,623
so hard, but the pressure is
hard. The comparison game is

1042
00:51:42,623 --> 00:51:44,003
hard. Everything is hard.

1043
00:51:46,235 --> 00:51:49,264
Bekah: I feel like I was like,
oh, there should be Calendly

1044
00:51:49,295 --> 00:51:52,474
links to like, meet with your
mentor slash meet with your

1045
00:51:52,474 --> 00:51:54,139
therapist. It should be right
next to each other. Cause I

1046
00:51:54,139 --> 00:51:55,804
think

1047
00:51:55,804 --> 00:52:01,460
it would be useful. Um, well, I
want to thank you Yolanda for

1048
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:04,340
being here and sharing your
journey with us. Cause I think

1049
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:06,620
this is super valuable and a lot
of people are going to learn

1050
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,900
from

1051
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:14,480
this episode. Um, are there any,
uh, do you want to share any of

1052
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,714
your biggest lessons or tips for
those out there? Listening

1053
00:52:16,714 --> 00:52:18,948
before

1054
00:52:18,949 --> 00:52:20,539
we head off for the day?

1055
00:52:24,704 --> 00:52:26,084
Yolanda: Take your time. It
takes time. Sorry. I should say

1056
00:52:26,084 --> 00:52:27,464
it

1057
00:52:27,465 --> 00:52:31,125
takes time. Everything takes
time. Um, try to have that

1058
00:52:31,304 --> 00:52:35,684
ingrained in your head. It's
just, everything takes time.

1059
00:52:35,715 --> 00:52:37,620
Networking takes time. Learning
how to code takes time. Finding

1060
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,525
a

1061
00:52:39,525 --> 00:52:44,034
job takes time. Then you know,
the, the main foundation is, it

1062
00:52:44,054 --> 00:52:47,534
just, it takes time. So I wish I
had that ingrained in me instead

1063
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:52,289
of hurry. Hurry, hurry. Fear of
missing out. It's just stop,

1064
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,070
breathe and like, okay, it's
gonna, it's gonna take time. And

1065
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:59,130
that is okay. That is definitely
okay. I'm not going to miss out

1066
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:01,350
on jobs. I'm not gonna miss out
on opportunities. Um, because

1067
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,570
I'm

1068
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,654
just going to focus on what I
can do at this moment in time.

1069
00:53:05,654 --> 00:53:07,738
And if

1070
00:53:07,739 --> 00:53:11,730
that's all I can do, that's all
I can do. So just, just take it

1071
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,090
easy.

1072
00:53:14,074 --> 00:53:17,494
Dan: love that. I love that
advice a lot. I think that, I

1073
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:19,339
think that's a great note to end
on. Um, and I wanted to say

1074
00:53:19,339 --> 00:53:21,184
thank

1075
00:53:21,184 --> 00:53:24,614
you Yolanda too. I, I really
appreciate it here. Well,

1076
00:53:24,614 --> 00:53:28,844
everything really? Um, it was
good. I think what Bekah said is

1077
00:53:28,844 --> 00:53:31,275
right, a lot of people are going
to find this really valuable. So

1078
00:53:31,514 --> 00:53:32,565
thank you again for coming on.

1079
00:53:33,684 --> 00:53:34,135
Bekah: bye.
