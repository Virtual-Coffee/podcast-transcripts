00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,829
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 1, Episode

2
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:23,699
4 of the Virtual Coffee Podcast.
I'm Bekah, and this is

3
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,670
a podcast that features members
of the Virtual Coffee community.

4
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:30,449
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

5
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,219
stages of their coding journey.
And they're here, on this

6
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,989
podcast,

7
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,079
sharing their stories and what
they've learned. And we're here

8
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,070
to share it with you. Here with
me today is my co-host, Dan.

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,079
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. In this
episode, you'll hear from Vic

10
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,130
Vijayakumar. Vic is a principal
software engineer at Research

11
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,299
Square, a preprint platform.
When he's not at his day job, he

12
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:56,659
works on his bootstrap startup,
Everyoak, a school management

13
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:00,409
system. Vic is addicted to
building things. Vic sat down

14
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:02,960
with us to tell us about his
experiences with indie hacking,

15
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,650
and gave us his take on when to
ship, what to focus on, and the

16
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,189
value of diverse opinions in
your community among many other

17
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:13,849
things. It was a really great
conversation. And I personally

18
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:17,930
learned a lot. Just as a
production note, this is

19
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,349
actually the second time we've
recorded with Vic. We had a

20
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:24,620
technical mishap and lost the
first recording. But Vic was

21
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,890
gracious enough to sit down with
us for a second time. And so, I

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,760
just wanted to say another thank
you to Vic for joining us again.

23
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:34,829
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast

24
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,680
like we start every Virtual
Coffee. We introduce ourselves

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,764
with our name, where we're from,
what we do, and a random

26
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:41,848
check-in

27
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,859
question. Today's question is,
if you could add any superpower

28
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,579
to your abilities, what would
you choose? We hope you enjoy

29
00:01:50,579 --> 00:02:05,790
this episode. Hey, I'm Bekah, I
am a front-end

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:13,199
developer from a small town in
Ohio. And if I could add one

31
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:13,199
power, I would add telepathy.

32
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:19,830
Dan: Telepathy is dangerous. Hi,
I'm Dan. I'm a front-end

33
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,189
developer from Cleveland. And I
think if I could pick a

34
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:26,939
superpower, it might be
teleportation, that always

35
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,949
seemed like a-a good and handy
one to have.

36
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:29,789
Bekah: Solid choice.

37
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,469
Vic Vijayakumar: You would save
so much time.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Bekah: Mm.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Dan: Yeah.

40
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,820
Vic: Hi, I'm Vic. I am a full
stack principal engineer from

41
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,610
Raleigh,

42
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,560
North Carolina. I'm also an
indie maker. My preferred

43
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,129
superpower of choice would
probably be to be right the

44
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:48,449
first time, every time.

45
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,360
Bekah: Also would save you time.

46
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,680
Vic: [Whispers] So much time.

47
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:55,650
Bekah: All of these, this is-
this is what it

48
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,319
essentially is all about. We
just want the superpower that

49
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,370
saves us the most time.

50
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,280
Dan: It's really just telling
honestly [laughs]. We're

51
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,120
just telling on ourselves.

52
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,949
Bekah: [Laughs] Awesome. Well,
thank you, Vic, for being

53
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:14,729
here with us. We are very happy
to be recording with you. So, we

54
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:18,360
always like to get a little bit
of background on our guests. And

55
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,330
so, we'd love to hear about how
you got into tech.

56
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:27,569
Vic: Sure. Okay. So, I actually
have kind of a- a

57
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,864
traditional background, if you
will, in the sense that I have

58
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:32,129
a- a

59
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,340
bachelor's degree in computer
engineering from Iowa State

60
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,085
University. But before that,
probably-- so, we- we used to

61
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,830
own a

62
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:46,560
computer when—not like when I
was super young—but when I was

63
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,979
in high school. And then,
probably the first, like,

64
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,729
programming thing I did was that
in high school, one of my

65
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:55,574
parents' friends actually, they
invited me to come do, like, a-

66
00:03:55,574 --> 00:03:57,419
a

67
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,789
month-long internship with them.
So, I wrote software for them

68
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:02,159
the

69
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,189
very first time. Like, I'd never
written code before. But they

70
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:10,469
helped me kind of write code for
the Kenya Duty Free Shopping

71
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:13,634
network. So, I've worked in
Visual Basic and ... Visual

72
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:16,799
Basic

73
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,860
and, like, Access or something
like that. And for that, they

74
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,629
paid me with a US robotics
modem. So, that was my very

75
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,398
first

76
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,700
quote, unquote paid project for
writing code. And then, let's

77
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,970
see.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,220
And then, really, I didn't do
anything else kinda like

79
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,684
programming related, until I
went to college. Where I kinda

80
00:04:35,684 --> 00:04:39,029
did

81
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:43,139
a lot of different, like, tech
support kinda jobs. But my

82
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,500
very first kinda like breakout
into software development, like,

83
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,050
web development, came when I got
let go from the support job and

84
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,110
then I was just looking for
something else. And the Office

85
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,790
of Admissions that I was in the
university, they were looking

86
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,470
for an entry-level

87
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,160
programmer and I was completely
unqualified for this

88
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,699
job, but I applied for it anyway
because someone said I should.

89
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,249
Then I figured, "Okay." [Laughs]
So, I applied for this job. And

90
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:10,378
they

91
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:13,410
pretty much told me that. They
said, "You are not qualified for

92
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,629
this role at all. But you sound
confident, and you look like you

93
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:21,314
could learn." And so, they gave
me this job, and which then

94
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:23,999
became

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,220
a full-time role after I
graduated college for a little

96
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,360
bit. And then, when my
girlfriend then wife now moved

97
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,620
to North Carolina, I got another
job. And I've been at that job

98
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,430
for 14 years. That actually is
the entirety of my journey into

99
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:38,759
tech.

100
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:41,660
Bekah: I love that. And there
are so many hot

101
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,475
tips dropped there, apply for
jobs that you are not qualified

102
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:45,290
for.

103
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Vic: Yes. Definitely.

104
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,970
Bekah: Sound confident. Who
knows? All right. So, that is

105
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,740
how you got

106
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:56,089
into tech. Now, how did you come
to find Virtual Coffee?

107
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,790
Vic: Oh, this is a fun one too.
So, I think I saw

108
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:04,529
one of your tweets, Bekah. It
was April last year, everything

109
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,909
was a dumpster fire. And I think
I hadn't, like, seen any adults

110
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,265
in a [chuckles] couple months.
Because I-- you know, I haven't

111
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:13,620
been going into

112
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,699
work anymore since about
February or so actually. And

113
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:21,000
then I saw your tweet, I think
it was in a CodeNewbie's thread

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,398
or something like that, where
you talked about Virtual Coffee.

115
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:28,469
And I figured, "Hey, I should go
make some new friends." So, that

116
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,529
was probably I-- no, I remember
responding to your tweet and

117
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,170
that I missed the first one of
those. And then, I came to the

118
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,220
second one. And I think, I've
come to just about at least one

119
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,509
session every week or so.

120
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,029
Bekah: Yeah, that is awesome.
You have been here

121
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:45,779
for almost the entirety of
Virtual Coffee, because we did--

122
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:49,019
I think it was the first week of
April, we're coming up on our-

123
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:52,019
our one year birthday, or
anniversary, or whatever, very

124
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:52,439
soon.

125
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,139
Dan: It was crazy.

126
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:53,949
Bekah: Right? [Chuckles]

127
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:54,759
Vic: Virtual party.

128
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,319
Bekah: It's, like, literally, I
have an issue open

129
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,339
in a repo that's, like, [soft
festive voice] birthday party

130
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:07,300
[chuckles]. Okay. So, we are
talking to you today about

131
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,490
indie hacking. And so, the first
time I

132
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,610
heard the term indie hacking, I
thought it meant, like, somebody

133
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,159
that hacked independently, and
[chuckles] so, let's start there

134
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:19,708
with the

135
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:22,410
actual definition of what indie
hacking is.

136
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:25,350
Vic: Sure. I mean-- so, it is a
portmanteau of

137
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,139
independent and hacking, but
hacking in this case actually

138
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,099
refers to-- I think indie making
is probably a better term than

139
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,088
indie hacking, that-- but I
think right now it's used kind

140
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,354
of synonymously with the
indiehackers.com community,

141
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:40,619
which is,

142
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,600
like, one of the largest
community of indie makers. But

143
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:48,240
it, you know, oftentimes refers
to people that are just

144
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,720
independent, like, solopreneur,
like, bootstrap developers that

145
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,800
are kind of making and pushing
out various products. You know,

146
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,889
sometimes you do it for money, a
lot of times you just do it

147
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:03,329
because making things makes you
happy. I fall into the latter

148
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:03,810
category.

149
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,139
Bekah: All right. So, let's talk
about some of those

150
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,238
things, because you're making
lots of them, right? [Chuckles]

151
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,220
Vic: Yeah, some things end up-
some things end

152
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,980
up going out publicly. And a lot
of things don't. And I'm trying

153
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,619
to do a much better thing of
that this year. So, I built a

154
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:22,258
lot of

155
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:27,240
stuff. And then, I used to kinda
have this outlook of, "Oh, I

156
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,339
didn't-- this thing is not
perfect." And I'm just going to

157
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:33,149
kind of, you know, not let it go
out. And my- my thing now has

158
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:35,580
been to, like, push things out
as drafts and kind of talk about

159
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,850
them publicly, because you never
know who is going to be

160
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,779
interested in the thing you're
building. Let's see. One of my

161
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:44,924
biggest projects—and it's
actually used—it's called the

162
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,039
Everyoak.

163
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,570
It's at everyoak.com. It's a
preschool management software.

164
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,629
And it's used by my kids' school
actually. I was really sick of

165
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:00,809
filling out all the various
forms that I had to fill out

166
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:04,080
when I dropped them off. So,
like, right now they do COVID

167
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,700
screening, they don't use paper
because they use, you know,

168
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,320
Everyoak.

169
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,980
When you're applying, you have
to fill out all these

170
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,620
various forms, you have to fill
out all the allergy information,

171
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,200
and when it changes, you have to
go drop off new forms, and all

172
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,129
kinds of things, and I didn't
really want to do that. So, I

173
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:24,899
worked with them to basically
build this thing. And a lot of

174
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,710
different schools were
interested in it. I have two

175
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,519
schools that use it right now.
And, you know, it's profitable.

176
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:36,000
But yeah, that's probably the
biggest one. I've dealt a few

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,314
other things that-- so, I run
this-- [chuckles] ran- ran this

178
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:42,628
beer festival for

179
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:46,889
the last 10 years in Raleigh.
It's not happening this year,

180
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:50,489
but it happened the last, like,
nine years or so. Let's see.

181
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,000
What else?

182
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,879
Bekah: Well, I just want to
pause for a second

183
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:58,169
and touch on Everyoak, because
I've got four kids. So, filling

184
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,870
out those forms requires an
incredible amount of time and

185
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,559
ridiculous effort, because we're
doing it every single year. The

186
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,850
same forms, right? Like, there--
why do we have to continually do

187
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,990
this? So, anything that makes
that process easier is in my

188
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,549
book, like, the best thing ever
[chuckles].

189
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:21,298
Vic: And a lot of parents think
that too. Like, this--

190
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:24,178
so, usually what happens, right,
is the schools open up

191
00:10:24,178 --> 00:10:26,008
enrollment, and then, it, like,
goes on for, like, a month or

192
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:27,838
so.

193
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,578
And then, the schools- the
schools take another, like, I

194
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:31,317
don't know,

195
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:36,749
month or so to do the
assignment. And at my- at my

196
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:41,009
three-year-old school, they
actually just finished doing

197
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:42,704
enrollment, and then did a class
assignment in, like, a few

198
00:10:42,704 --> 00:10:44,399
hours,

199
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,399
and send all those out already,
and the parents all love their

200
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,239
choices. And meanwhile, you have
all these other schools that are

201
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:56,158
still having their parents drop
off forms. And- and I mean,

202
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:59,788
it's, you know, it's a pandemic
out, even if you're not lazy, I

203
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:03,509
still don't wanna come drop off
forms. And then, their class

204
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:05,549
assignment takes so long.
Anyway, it's-- the parents love

205
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:07,589
it, the

206
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,599
schools love it, and it's-- and
it's going decently. It-- you

207
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:11,609
know, I

208
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:13,273
don't expect to get rich off of
the-- of what the [laughs]

209
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,937
preschool

210
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:18,479
square [??] me, but it makes me
really happy to be able to do

211
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:20,788
this. And it makes me especially
happy that I don't have to fill

212
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:21,389
out forms.

213
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:25,860
Dan: So- so with- with Everyoak
in particular, I- I

214
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,000
imagine with the indie hacking
sort of like mantra is, you

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,129
know, if you- you- you have an
idea of something either in your

216
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:34,258
life

217
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:35,819
or- or- or something that, like,
you are excited about, or would,

218
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:37,379
like,

219
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:41,549
make your life easier, and just
kind of go for it, right? With

220
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,779
Everyoak, there's, like, the
motivation from your side as a

221
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,779
parent is clear, you know? The--
a-and it seems like a cool

222
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,779
problem

223
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,894
to solve. And you said you-
you-- so- so, the next step at--

224
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:56,009
you know,

225
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,370
you can either do it in a- in a
vacuum, or you said you actually

226
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,200
worked with your school to
figure it out. Especially with-

227
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,730
with daycares, and- and things
like that, that seems like a

228
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,230
tricky

229
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,129
thing to step in-into, unless
you have, you know, some

230
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:12,929
assurance that you [chuckles]--
you know, you're doing it the

231
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:14,729
right way, or the- the

232
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,018
way that a school would want. So
... so, how- how, like, how did

233
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,029
that process work out? Like, at
the beginning, at least?

234
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:23,580
Vic: Yeah. So, you said the
right thing there,

235
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,549
which is that it-- so, it
definitely is easier to work on

236
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:29,340
things that scratch your own
itch, because you just have to

237
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,960
talk to fewer people, right? But
in order for something to be--

238
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,059
I mean, it depends on how you
define success, right? If you

239
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,879
want to build something for the
sake of building something, and

240
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,360
just get those-- you know, get
that muscle memory working of

241
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,940
just building things and getting
them out, you know, maybe you

242
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,269
want to only scratch your own
itch. But if you're trying to

243
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:53,789
monetize it, or if you're trying
to help people other than

244
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:57,059
yourself, you're gonna have to
go talk to people. It's

245
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,450
definitely easier when there's--
when you're working with just

246
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,649
one school, right? But then the-
the fun thing is-- so, I built

247
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,649
something very custom to that
school. But then I saw things in

248
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:09,479
their process that I could
improve. So, I would work on,

249
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,309
like,

250
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,100
those improvements, and then
show it to them. And they were

251
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,809
really happy with what I did.
And they just-- they kinda

252
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:17,518
just--

253
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,450
once- once they realized that I
was making their process better

254
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,200
for them, they just let me just
do the things that I thought

255
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,215
were good ideas. And [chuckles]
... and then when the next

256
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:31,230
school joined up,

257
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,679
I said, "Here's a system that
works really well for school

258
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:37,000
one." And they said, "Great. If
it works for them, it'll

259
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,000
probably work for us."

260
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Dan: Sure [chuckles].

261
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,276
Vic: And then-- so, at this
point, [chuckles] I'm- I'm

262
00:13:42,276 --> 00:13:44,552
basically, you know, becoming an
expert in building workflows

263
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:46,828
for- for preschools.

264
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:50,639
And they trust that I know what
I'm doing because some other

265
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,799
school uses it. So, it's kind of
like ... I don't know what to

266
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,959
call

267
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,800
it. It's kinda just like ... I-
I don't know what you call it.

268
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,970
Cloud by- by just faking it, I
guess.

269
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,279
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. No, that's-
that's really interesting. And-

270
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:06,779
and, yep, I don't know. I lost
my- I lost my train of thought

271
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,249
there [laughs].

272
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,610
Vic: I mean, I've worked on a
few other things

273
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,019
there too, that, like, don't
necessarily kind of-- are not

274
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:13,788
that

275
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:17,960
easy in terms of thinking about
how to make it work. So, let's

276
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,700
see. So I have, like-- I mean,
you-- do you want me to tell

277
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,000
you about things that didn't
work?

278
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Bekah: Yeah!

279
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Vic: Because it's [chuckles]--

280
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:25,168
Dan: Absolutely. I mean,
absolutely.

281
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,690
Vic: Yeah. And then, you know,
and it- and it was a thing

282
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,299
that I learned. I definitely did
learn something there as well.

283
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:34,320
So, I built something called ...
well, it was- it was called Dog

284
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,984
Ears because I- I just found
this picture of this dog I

285
00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:37,648
really

286
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:38,834
liked with droopy ears, and I
was like, "That's a good name

287
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,019
for

288
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,779
this thing." So, it was just a-
it was just a product that would

289
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:46,470
help you, like, search through
your- your Twitter likes and

290
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,809
retweets and whatnot, because
Twitter's interface itself

291
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:51,104
doesn't, like, let you do that
really well. So, I built this

292
00:14:51,104 --> 00:14:53,399
thing. And

293
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,549
my goal was just to, like, see
how fast I could build this

294
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:01,350
thing. And it took me about,
like, an hour a day, for 12 days

295
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:07,139
is what it took. And ultimately,
it failed because I was using,

296
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,110
like, a trial version of
Algolia, and I realized that if

297
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,000
I had to pay for ... like, it
was just not-

298
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Dan: Yeah.

299
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,730
Vic: -sustainable at the price
that I'll-- I could charged

300
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,460
for. And so, I just let it die.
So, the

301
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,769
website for that is still out
there, but you can't really sign

302
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,629
up. And-- but I learned, like, a
ton of stuff. I learned about,

303
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,489
like,

304
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,480
all the wrong things you could
choose. I learned about, like,

305
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,179
needing to make sure that
something was sustainable before

306
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,600
you, you know, spend time on it.
And the thing is this wasn't

307
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,539
even a, you know, this wasn't
even like something that scratch

308
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:39,120
my own itch because ultimately,
I didn't care about this

309
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,120
problem-

310
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Dan: [Chuckles] Yeah.

311
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,605
Vic: -you know? So, I just let
that one die. But I learned a

312
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:48,210
ton of stuff out of it. I
learned a lot of new tools

313
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,694
that I had not previously used.
So, you know, I got something

314
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:53,129
out of it. And I consider that a
win.

315
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:56,580
Bekah: For sure. I think that
the framing of what a

316
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,470
win is, is really important
there, right? Because you are

317
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,740
learning something, you can take
that to a different project,

318
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,915
maybe it's not going to be the
same product to that you're

319
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:09,090
making.

320
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,129
But now you have experience
that- that guides-- the next

321
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:13,168
thing

322
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:15,690
that's gonna be better. And if
it's something that you're

323
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,549
interested in, then, great.

324
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:20,818
Vic: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And I
have a lot of things

325
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:23,938
like that, right? Where the next
thing I build, I'm not gonna

326
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:26,969
be starting at zero, because I'm
gonna take whatever, you

327
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:28,724
know, all the failed parts-- all
the good parts of Dog Ears

328
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:32,818
that, you know, didn't fail.
I'll probably start from, like,

329
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:35,818
something where I already have a
site, I already have a way to

330
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:39,568
charge people, I already have,
you know, all of that going. And

331
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:42,808
then I saved myself a whole lot
of time. And I think i-it

332
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:45,103
definitely is helpful, like,
that way to have, like, a- a

333
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:47,398
framework,

334
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,458
you know, a framework of how you
would do things because it means

335
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:54,298
you don't spend time chasing-
chasing, you know, shiny things

336
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:55,340
of like, "Oh, let me, like,
build the-- a whole new

337
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,382
framework of,

338
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,468
like, how

339
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:01,229
to do this." Instead, you're
focusing just on, like, "What

340
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:05,128
problem am I going to solve?"
It's been helpful for me anyway.

341
00:17:05,848 --> 00:17:07,499
I don't know if I, like, said
that clearly. But [chuckles]--

342
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,680
Bekah: I just learned so much
from everything

343
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,675
that you just said. I love that.
Like, and th-th-this starting

344
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:14,670
with, you

345
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,569
know, this idea of you're not
starting at zero the next time,

346
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,500
right? Cuz there's this, like,
sense of, like, "Oh, I- I failed

347
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,489
at something. And now I have to
start over." But you're- you're

348
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:29,579
not starting over at zero.

349
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:30,200
Dan: Yeah, I think another-
another-

350
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Vic: Yeah. Totally. Totally
true.

351
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,800
Dan: -sorry. I was gonna say, I
think another interesting aspect

352
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,400
of that is that in-- I mean, we
can all agree to

353
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,539
not view this as a failure, or
at least as a negative thing,

354
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:45,569
right? But knowing when to pull
the plug or stop ... you know,

355
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:50,504
stop putting effort, or money,
or time into a- into a- into a

356
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:52,409
thing. I think,

357
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,769
like, a side project like this.
Do you have like a-- you

358
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:58,259
mentioned you had sort of lost
interest in the problem itself,

359
00:17:58,259 --> 00:17:59,789
which is [chuckles] I'm sure a
big warning sign, but do you

360
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:01,319
have like a

361
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,584
rubric that you use for your own
side projects of when to- to

362
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:06,924
leave? Or is it just, like, when
it feels, like [crosstalk],

363
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:07,999
I've done this?

364
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,650
Vic: Yeah. So, this is-- that's
a- that's a very good

365
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,320
question. And it's actually
kinda deep, right? It's-- so, I

366
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,990
have

367
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,730
this problem. Had? Have? I- I
don't know if I still have it or

368
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,470
not.

369
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:22,049
But it's [chuckles], it's this
thing of, like-- I- I like- I

370
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:24,479
like starting new

371
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,225
things, far more than I like
to-- so, I like starting new

372
00:18:27,225 --> 00:18:29,970
things.

373
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:32,730
And that, you know, that's the
kind of like the most exciting

374
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,259
part of it for me, right? But
it-- but it's- but it's a bit

375
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:35,788
of an--

376
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,655
like, a- a negative addiction,
right, to start new things but

377
00:18:38,655 --> 00:18:41,430
to not

378
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,509
actually, like, keep working on
them? So, I have to kind of plan

379
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:49,410
for the possibility that I'm
gonna lose the interest in that

380
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:57,058
thing. So, the way that I kind
of work to mitigate that is that

381
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:00,150
I start to-- I have to start to
launch things as soon as

382
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,470
possible. And if I use the- the
preschool management thing as an

383
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,210
example, right? So, the moment I
launched it and rail people

384
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,509
started using it, it was no
longer a thing that I could just

385
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:14,909
say, "No one uses this. I can
just shut this down and move on

386
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:15,000
to something else."

387
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Dan: Yeah.

388
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,639
Vic: Now there-- now first of
all, I have proved that someone

389
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:23,278
wanted to use it, you know? And
the real

390
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,470
consequences to me, I'd be
ending it and not working on it

391
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,849
anymore. And the fact that
someone was using it, then made

392
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:34,349
it a lot more fun to, like, keep
working on it-

393
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:34,349
Dan: Yeah.

394
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:37,334
Vic: -so, it kind of like, kind
of-- it kind of helped

395
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:40,319
that situation. But [laughs] not
using

396
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,920
that example, when do I know
when to stop working on a thing?

397
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,490
When I'm not having fun with it.
Because if I'm not having fun

398
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:53,009
doing something, I'm not gonna
keep doing it. So, people often,

399
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:55,004
like, talk about, like, "How do
you choose a problem to work

400
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:56,999
on?" And

401
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:58,529
so, there's several schools of
thought on this. One is that,

402
00:19:58,529 --> 00:19:59,999
you

403
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,599
know, work on something that is
going to, like, make you rich

404
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,940
for example. I don't know.
That's- that's a- that's an

405
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,720
actual rubric some people go
with. Or work on something that,

406
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,230
like, you're passionate about.
Maybe that works for you. Or,

407
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,859
like, work on something that, I
don't know, some other- some

408
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:18,419
other rubric for you. And I
guess if it's not-- if you're

409
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:19,979
not

410
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,400
having fun with it, if you're no
longer motivated to keep doing

411
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,915
that thing, that's probably the
[chuckles] time to move on. Or

412
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:26,430
at least,

413
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,460
you know, pause it. If it's the
sort of thing that can, like,

414
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:35,039
keep going while you can focus
on something else, then that's

415
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,130
good. If it's the sort of thing
that if you stopped working on

416
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,730
it will just die off-- I don't
know. Maybe you should have

417
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,455
launched earlier or-- I don't
know. It's- it's totally fine,

418
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:47,000
right? It's totally fine to just
stop working on the thing.

419
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Dan: Yeah.

420
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,809
Vic: If that's what makes
[chuckles] you happy.

421
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,170
Dan: Yeah, that's- that's a
struggle that I have had wi-with

422
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,555
things like this, it is-- it's
sort of guilt, you know? I mean,

423
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:56,910
like,

424
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,910
losing interest a-as a kind of
automatically stop working on

425
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,660
something if nobody else is
asked me to.

426
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,009
Vic: [Laughs] My abandoned
projects need friends.

427
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:03,419
Dan: Right? Like [laughs], I
don't know, or guilt, or, I

428
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:04,769
don't

429
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:07,230
know, shame even, you know? I
mean, it's not like deep, dark

430
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,639
shame. But it's still-- it's
like, I have these, like, random

431
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:10,048
side

432
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:13,109
projects, there's links to them
on my site probably, somewhere,

433
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,099
you know, from years ago. And
it's- it's sometimes it's hard

434
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:20,534
to not f- not feel bad, you
know, or- or embarrassed of- of-

435
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:23,969
of a thing where- where

436
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,880
you can clearly look at this and
say, "Oh, this is a failed side

437
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,545
project," right? Like
[chuckles], you know, a- a thing

438
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:30,210
that went nowhere.

439
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,589
Whereas the framing of this was
a side project, and it was kind

440
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:36,449
of fun, and I learned some
stuff. And, you know, it-- I

441
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:38,309
think

442
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:42,660
it's a very healthy and good way
to frame things. And it seems

443
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,009
like you have [chuckles]-- it
seems like you personally have

444
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:47,069
that-- most of that figured out
pretty well.

445
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,240
Vic: I hope so.

446
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,529
Bekah: All right. I wanna touch
back on this idea of when

447
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:54,750
to launch, you said, well, like,
maybe you didn't launch early

448
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,970
enough. So, I know there's,
like, lots of different

449
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,190
perspectives

450
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,390
on when you should launch and
how much you should have done,

451
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,049
what features you have planned
out? Or have you completed most

452
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:11,130
of the features on your list?
So, I wanna know, what is your

453
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,089
personal take on on process and
when to launch?

454
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,049
Vic: You should launch as soon
as you feel

455
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:21,809
ready. That's the thing. But
sometimes, you have to force

456
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:27,000
yourself to- to accept that
something is ready. Otherwise,

457
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:30,089
you will keep waiting, and
waiting, and waiting. And it's

458
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:32,730
possible you might lose the
motivation to launch it, right?

459
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:34,814
So-- and the thing is, I- I
think when I say the word

460
00:22:34,814 --> 00:22:36,539
launch,

461
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,264
people often think, like, press
release, or, like, tweet about

462
00:22:38,264 --> 00:22:39,989
it.

463
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:42,960
It doesn't have to be that. You
could silently, quietly launch

464
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,819
and tell nobody. But it might
just be a psychological win for

465
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:51,630
you to know that though that
thing is on, you know, on

466
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,130
production on a secret URL, but
I can access it, and it works,

467
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,630
and I

468
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,594
can log into it, and I can use
it, might be the psychological

469
00:22:56,594 --> 00:22:58,558
win

470
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,119
that you need to keep working on
it. And that's totally fine. Or

471
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,779
sometimes, you can just launch
something with just a sign-up

472
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:10,439
URL that says "Coming Soon" and
"Sign Up for This", which is

473
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,859
good enough, right, for you to--
for at least, like, drum up some

474
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,859
excitement or whatever. But
yeah, I would say that that is

475
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:21,599
entirely up to you, but I like
to default toward pushing

476
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,890
something out early and then,
iterating on that, as opposed to

477
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,859
waiting a long time and then,
like, ending up with, you know,

478
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,359
dead rock or something like
that.

479
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:35,130
Bekah: I feel that also deeply.
I am the person that

480
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,000
creates things and then doesn't
put them out there. And I was

481
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,335
working on this project earlier
this year. And it was a very,

482
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,000
like, deeply

483
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,920
personal, but I had, like,
quietly launched it just-- so,

484
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,945
I knew about it, and one other
person, and I had said, like,

485
00:23:48,945 --> 00:23:51,300
you know,

486
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,640
"I'll probably put this out to
the public in about a month

487
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,500
or so." Well, they missed that
in about a month or so, and

488
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,000
then, like, posted about it on
social-

489
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Vic: Oh, no.

490
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,110
Bekah: -media. And I was like,
"Okay, well [laughs], I guess

491
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:05,220
somebody pushed me off the
diving board and- and now I'm

492
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,659
going for this." Which in that
sense, like, was really good.

493
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,098
The

494
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:13,019
project wasn't done, I scrambled
for a couple of days, but also,

495
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:18,329
I might not have launched the
project had somebody not been

496
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:19,170
talking about it.

497
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:25,029
Vic: You know, if- if- if you
push something out, and if

498
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:28,839
someone starts to use it, and
their feedback to you is, "This

499
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:32,289
is good but it could use more,"
that's good feedback. I would

500
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:37,210
rather that then no one use it.
You know, it's ... yeah. I would

501
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,175
totally- I would totally get
negative attention [chuckles]

502
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:41,140
than, like,

503
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,650
none at all for, you know,
something that I launched. But

504
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,200
I'm glad you were able to do
that. Like, that would prob-

505
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,660
that situation would probably
stressed me out if someone did

506
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,970
a-- an announcement of something
that I built but I

507
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:52,869
wasn't ready for it yet.

508
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:53,950
Bekah: It stressed me out. It
did [laughs].

509
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:59,094
Dan: [Laughs] Can you talk a
little bit about, like, some

510
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:00,879
tools you

511
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,500
use to make- to make this
process easier, you know, when

512
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,640
you're working on side projects,
things like that?

513
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:11,430
Vic: Yeah. So, I- I use a lot of
no-code tools, actually--

514
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,000
low-code tools, I should say.
So, I'm not one of those people

515
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,309
that, like, builds entirely with
no-code stuff. But I- I do use,

516
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:23,369
like-- Airtable and Zapier are
probably, like, my two biggest

517
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:26,819
things where I just, you know,
duct tape things together when I

518
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:31,589
need to get them to work really
fast. So, the other day, I had

519
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:35,549
this- I had this, like, I don't
know. I- I thought of this joke.

520
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:39,420
And it was kind of a really
silly joke. And I- and I told

521
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:44,039
you, Dan, or I said it's a- it's
a community for people who are

522
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,890
working from home to talk to
each other. And then, there's

523
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,789
sweatpants. It can be called
meetsweats.com. And then, I

524
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,799
laughed about it for so long.

525
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:55,704
Dan: [Laughs] I was-- because
Vic- Vic Slacked me this on a

526
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:57,339
Friday night. I was

527
00:25:57,339 --> 00:26:02,019
watching TV with- with my wife,
with Emily. And she had to pause

528
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,540
what we're watching because I
was laughing so hard [laughs].

529
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,910
And then-- oh, I

530
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,640
shared it with her too, which
she also laughed. But I was just

531
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,759
sitting there on the couch ...
on my phone, laughing, and it

532
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:14,140
was just about meetsweats.com
[laughs].

533
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:16,684
Vic: I-- and I was like, "Surely
that's already a

534
00:26:16,684 --> 00:26:18,079
website."

535
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:21,259
So, I went there, and it didn't
exist, and the domain was

536
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:25,400
available. So, I bought, you
know, meet, like, M-E-E-T,

537
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,724
sweats, like, you know,
sweatpants. So, I bought

538
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:29,538
meetsweats.com [chuckles]

539
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:34,789
for $4 because I was like, "This
is-- the-- like, $4 is gonna

540
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:36,544
be worth it for me." And then, I
think, I spent, like, the next

541
00:26:36,544 --> 00:26:38,299
two

542
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:40,519
hours-- so, I- I put my kids to
bed. And I was still kinda

543
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:42,739
giggling

544
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,774
about it while they-- while I
was brushing their teeth, and

545
00:26:43,774 --> 00:26:44,808
they were like,

546
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:47,239
"What is it?" I was like,
"Nothing. It's nothing. Well,

547
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,669
get it." I put them

548
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:54,049
to bed and ... and it feels like
forever, but it was just last

549
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:57,859
week. And while they were- while
they were- while they were

550
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:01,789
falling asleep, I just sat in a
room with my laptop and I built

551
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:04,759
out the site for this and
launched it. And it took

552
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,769
probably, like-- I don't know.
Like, an hour and a half or so.

553
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,815
And for that-- so, I just, you
know, I went on Carrd,

554
00:27:09,815 --> 00:27:12,170
C-A-R-R-D-dot-co, and I-- so,

555
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,859
that's a- that's a site that I
use for this, where I push out a

556
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:20,240
site, and I built a form on the
site, and it uses Airtable, and

557
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,534
it, like, people can sign up to
be notified. And, like, all of

558
00:27:22,534 --> 00:27:24,828
these

559
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:27,529
are super helpful. And it's a
way to early launch something,

560
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:29,419
right? While you decide if this
joke is [chuckles] worth any

561
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:31,309
more than,

562
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:34,880
like, the airtime we're already
got. And whether or not-- the

563
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,349
thing is-- the funny thing is,
like, something, like, 15 people

564
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:37,818
signed

565
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:38,944
up to be early notified
[crosstalk] after

566
00:27:38,944 --> 00:27:40,069
it's made up [unintelligible].

567
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,549
Bekah: It's me. Number one
[laughs].

568
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:45,359
Vic: Yep. [Laughs] You were the
first sign-up.

569
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:47,039
Bekah: Founding member.

570
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,759
Vic: So, this gonna be a really
good example

571
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:53,519
of like, you know, or like-- I
mean, I don't know anymore.

572
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,219
Like,

573
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,589
is it a joke? Well, it's-- if
it's- if it's just a joke, you

574
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:00,899
know, like, all

575
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,500
these people wanna be- wanna be
notified of, like, when this

576
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,225
thing launches. And then, a few
other people, like, quote

577
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:07,950
tweeted

578
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,970
it with their ideas of what it
should be. And, you know, I

579
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,700
think this is kind of a vote
for, like, building in public,

580
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:16,724
right? You don't really know
what it should be yet, but you

581
00:28:16,724 --> 00:28:18,359
take ideas

582
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:23,220
from the community. And, you
know, this whole thing—so, was

583
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,994
Carrd plus ... Airtable, and I
think that's pretty much all it

584
00:28:25,994 --> 00:28:28,768
was.

585
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:31,964
And it went out there. But a few
other tools I use are

586
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:34,619
Zapier—like

587
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:38,549
I said—and then I use, you know,
things like Mailchimp to-

588
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:42,660
to manage, like, newsletters and
stuff. But otherwise, I have a

589
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,550
pretty traditional-- just to--
not traditional, I guess. I

590
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,410
should

591
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,469
say, I have, like, a skeleton--
I have a skeleton project that I

592
00:28:49,469 --> 00:28:52,528
just

593
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:56,339
spin up for everything. And that
way, I'm not spending my time,

594
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,250
you know, trying to figure out,
"Oh, what should I choose for

595
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,089
this project that I'm building?"
And it's just something that

596
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:07,500
I've kinda forced myself to not
do anymore. Where I don't--

597
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,820
like, it [laughs] kind--
unfortunately, it removes the

598
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,140
excitement of it.

599
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,940
Like, I used to be like, "Oh,
I'm gonna do this thing." And

600
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,680
then,

601
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,589
I would spend the first week of
it just, like, building the

602
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,710
authentication and doing all
these little things. And now I

603
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,740
just know that I don't have to
do any of that. I could just

604
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,119
spin up the skeleton project and
just start off. And I know that

605
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,609
at, like, minute one, it can
already charge people, which

606
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:36,539
means that I focus on, like, the
actual problem instead of like,

607
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:41,099
the distracting other parts of
it. So, that's really helped me

608
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:45,210
out. It also means that I start
fewer things. Because it means

609
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,305
that I have to, like, actually
come up with, like, what I'm

610
00:29:46,305 --> 00:29:49,440
going to do before I, you know,
start on it.

611
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:53,368
Dan: Yeah, I think that
[chuckles]-- I mean, I think

612
00:29:53,368 --> 00:29:55,378
that's great. I think that's a-
a- a

613
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:58,348
great and sort of newer way to
think about a lot of this stuff.

614
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:00,884
And as a-- I mean, I, you know,
as-- I've been a developer for

615
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:02,249
a long

616
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:04,229
time, and it's natural to, like,
s-s, you know, think of a

617
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:06,209
problem and

618
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:11,159
say, "Okay, I'm going to start
writing React from scratch,"

619
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:11,160
and, you know, or- or- or
whatever it is. Because-

620
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,867
because, I don't know--

621
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:18,463
because that's what my job was,
you know, or is. And, like--

622
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:21,028
sometimes it's

623
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:27,028
hard to not do that. But making
it easy for yourself to- to get

624
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:29,158
going and solving the actual
problem is- is- is seems very--

625
00:30:29,158 --> 00:30:31,288
like, a

626
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:34,078
very good way to do things like
that. Especially if you're

627
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:36,209
starting things from scratch,
often, right?

628
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,130
Vic: Uh-huh. This year, I plan
to do that many, many more

629
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,450
times. Like, I- I was hoping to,
like-- I was hoping to start a

630
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:50,069
new project every month. Or, I
don't know. I don't-- I haven't

631
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:53,339
yet decided, but it's January
28th that I think Meet Sweats is

632
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:55,679
probably, like, the- [chuckles]
the project of this month. But

633
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,019
in February, I'm-

634
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:00,450
I'm gonna have to decide, like,
how much more work I'm gonna do

635
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,660
on that. Or if I'm gonna pick a
new project. It's just- it's

636
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,410
just training, I guess, to,
like, you know-- to just push

637
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,349
more things out ... in public.

638
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,039
Bekah: Yeah. I really like that
mindset. And I--

639
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:19,710
I've got 37 projects. So, if you
would like one, I will let you

640
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,000
do it [crosstalk] for February
[laughs].

641
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Vic: No, thanks.

642
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,549
Bekah: Yeah. That-- the point
Dan was making before about

643
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:35,098
using things-- there's- there's
a tendency to devalue

644
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:41,400
tools that make projects easier
if you could use something

645
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,720
harder, like React, right? Or
building a site from scratch

646
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,339
rather than using a template.
And I wish that more people were

647
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:56,130
talking about how you can do
these things to spin up

648
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,890
projects like what you're doing,
or saying, like, "Look, this is

649
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:03,000
just as valuable as a site
that's done in React because

650
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,174
who really cares if they are
solving the same problem

651
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,868
[chuckles]?"

652
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,520
Vic: Exactly. Yeah, your
customer-- your user doesn't

653
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,660
know

654
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,410
what you did. I mean, they don't
care what programming language

655
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,750
you're using, they don't care
what CSS framework you're using,

656
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,630
they just care that you're
making their life easier. You

657
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,084
know, it does-- I don't think--
I don't believe that, like,

658
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:25,140
you know, if you use something
easier, like-- I don't know.

659
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,289
Like-- I mean, you- you know,
you're playing- you're playing a

660
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:29,939
video game. I guess it's
entirely only in your head as

661
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:34,619
to, you know, what mode you were
playing it on. It really doesn't

662
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,624
matter ultimately. I- I think-
I- I think, I, like, just

663
00:32:35,624 --> 00:32:36,629
thought

664
00:32:36,629 --> 00:32:40,710
of something a little bit more
insightful for the sake of that,

665
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,494
but [chuckles] that's all I can
think of right now. I mean, I

666
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,278
use lots of

667
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:47,369
low-code or no-code things all
over the place. It's-- and you

668
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:50,729
know, it's not even just for
starting, right? Sometimes-- so,

669
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,309
like that- that beer festival
that I- that I talked about

670
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,400
earlier, you know? I don't
remember what it used to be at

671
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,859
the very beginning, but it's
been running on Airtable for

672
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:00,959
like-- I don't know. Like, four
or five years now. It works just

673
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:04,000
fine, you know?

674
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Dan: Yeah.

675
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,945
Vic: I-- and I will never
replace it. I'm not going to,

676
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:10,890
you know, spend a bunch of time
moving it over to PostgreS(QL)

677
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,900
or whatever. It- it works.

678
00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:17,970
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. We- we
... in Virtual Co- one of

679
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:22,470
the Virtual Coffees last week,
or maybe Tuesday? We were--

680
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:25,169
somebody was asking about, like,
if- if they were freelancing,

681
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:29,910
and somebody asked them to make
a site, you know, like, what-

682
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:35,160
what- what they should do,
right? And ... and some of the

683
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,374
answers at the beginning were,
"Oh, just write it in," you

684
00:33:36,374 --> 00:33:37,588
know--

685
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,470
I don't know. "React or Gatsby
or something, or, you know, even

686
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:43,470
11ty." And- and th-then we kind
of were talking about it for a

687
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,349
while, and especially if
somebody's paying you to do it,

688
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,180
they also probably don't care
[chuckles] what technology it's

689
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,980
written in

690
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,080
or- or what you use. And if you
are able to stand up a site,

691
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,000
like, you have that-- like,
using Caard, for example, right,

692
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,920
for

693
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,630
a-- like,

694
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,599
Caard i-i-is a service that-- is
basically a landing page

695
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:02,429
service, right? And you can add
a form to it, I think, and

696
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:05,730
maybe- maybe something else,
but--

697
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,650
Vic: Yeah. So, I have an example
about this, actually,

698
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,724
where-- so, when I started
Everyoak, it used to be just in

699
00:34:10,724 --> 00:34:15,644
the Airtable form. Where-- so,
it was just-- it was a-- so, it

700
00:34:15,644 --> 00:34:18,089
was a React

701
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,940
page-- it was a- it was a React
form, but then it's submitted to

702
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,440
Airtable, and that was actually
it. Because it-- there was no

703
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,699
login or anything like that, you
know? Parents would come, like,

704
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,909
fill out their application. And
then, the rest of it kinda got

705
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:37,110
built around that. And like-- it
ran that way for two years,

706
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,960
where all it did was submit to
an Airtable. Like, I didn't move

707
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,559
it over to, like, MySQL or
anything like that for a good

708
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:47,309
solid two years, and it worked
just fine, you know? The

709
00:34:47,309 --> 00:34:51,420
parents don't care. It still
makes their lives easier. And

710
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,679
then, the reason why I moved it
was ultimately because

711
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,909
[chuckles] I

712
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:56,820
exceeded Airtable's, like, free
limits. Not because I thought

713
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,695
like, "Oh, I'm-- like, I'm doing
something that-- you

714
00:34:58,695 --> 00:35:00,570
know, like--

715
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,994
you know, really good
programmers don't do," or

716
00:35:01,994 --> 00:35:03,389
anything

717
00:35:03,389 --> 00:35:04,979
like that, you know? I- I moved
it because you-- I just didn't

718
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:06,569
want to

719
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:10,000
pay money for- for what I was
doing. That's fine with it.

720
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Dan: Yeah.

721
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,814
Vic: And I don't think people
should be like, "Oh, if I use

722
00:35:13,814 --> 00:35:15,868
a-", you know, "-low-code

723
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:18,960
or no-code tool, I'm not a good
programmer," or something like

724
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,059
that. That's-- if- if, you know,
if someone is telling you

725
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:24,300
that, they don't know what
they're talking about.

726
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:30,869
Dan: Yeah. I- I mean, I agree.
And the framing of- of- of how a

727
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:33,569
person values themselves and
their abilities, I feel like ...

728
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:38,909
is either starting to shift, or-
or maybe I'm just, like, finding

729
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:43,019
better vocabular- you know,
vocabulary about it. But that,

730
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:44,909
like, if a client, for
instance-- I mean, I- I- I'm

731
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,799
independent

732
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,280
developer. So, clients are the
way I think about a lot of this

733
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,829
stuff, right? But if a client is
paying, like, is- is paying you,

734
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,079
they're not paying you for code
or, you know, React or- or

735
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,238
whatever,

736
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,934
right? They're paying you to get
the thing that they want

737
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:00,629
[chuckles], right?

738
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,989
They're paying you to have the
daycare, like, management

739
00:36:03,989 --> 00:36:09,480
software done. Not to do it in
the most, you know, detailed way

740
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,240
that some other judgy person
will judge you for [chuckles],

741
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,000
right? They- they don't care.

742
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Vic: [Chuckles] Exactly.

743
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,500
Dan: And- and so-- you know, my
point is just, like, to provide

744
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,328
value is the thing- is the thing
that you're working on.

745
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:25,619
Not- not that you're working on
becoming, like, a React expert,

746
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:26,969
or- or whatever, you know?

747
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:29,190
Vic: Right. And- and, you know,
it depends, of course,

748
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,589
whether you are doing this in a
job or-- but actually, even at

749
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:36,495
my day job, we actually use a
lot of Zapier and- and Airtable.

750
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:38,820
Like,

751
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,215
we had-- we're on the enterprise
levels of both Zapier

752
00:36:40,215 --> 00:36:41,610
and Airtable,

753
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:46,110
because, like, you gotta
maximize, you know, your value.

754
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,719
And we don't want to be building
all these-- so, this is just

755
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:50,399
going

756
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,190
to come off as, like, product
placement for Zapier or Neotel

757
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,650
but, [laughs] you know, there's-
there's so much stuff that we

758
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,110
just don't want to-- all this

759
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,000
duct tape we just don't need to
do.

760
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Dan: Yeah.

761
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,259
Vic: Cuz it, like-- it's cheaper
to pay for- for those tools on a

762
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:06,538
monthly basis than it

763
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:09,300
is to spent any amount of time,
like, building all the plumbing.

764
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Dan: Yep.

765
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,384
Vic: That- that's [laughs] all
I'll say about that. So, this

766
00:37:11,384 --> 00:37:14,940
[chuckles] doesn't become a
huge, like, endorsement or any--

767
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:16,920
Dan: No, it's true though. And
cheaper. Like, if you build

768
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,735
for the hour, or if your
employee or whatever, like,

769
00:37:18,735 --> 00:37:20,550
your-- anybody's

770
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,289
time is worth money and
somebody's paying for it

771
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,985
eventually [chuckles], right?
So, anytime you can save

772
00:37:23,985 --> 00:37:25,650
yourself time in,

773
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,795
you know, a productive way it--
that it's, like, easy to-- it's

774
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:29,880
an easy

775
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,390
win [laughs]. It's an easy
decision. I- I love it. I--

776
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,900
Zapier for it, like-- I have

777
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,535
just started scratching the
surface of Zapier for over the

778
00:37:38,535 --> 00:37:40,110
last

779
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,860
couple months. I think based on
your recommendation. But it's

780
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,840
just been-- I don't know. It's
been a revelation.

781
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:49,050
Vic: I kind of use it all over
the place. I have

782
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,894
some zaps that just told me,
like-- okay. So, this is a

783
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,738
pre-2020

784
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,494
story. But I have some zaps
that's-- that just tells me,

785
00:37:54,494 --> 00:37:56,249
like--

786
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:59,340
it monitors there is, like,
races that I used to run—like

787
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:01,214
road races—and it just tells me
when, like, registration opens

788
00:38:01,214 --> 00:38:04,304
up for those races, so, I could
[chuckles] go register and get

789
00:38:04,304 --> 00:38:07,560
bid number one [crosstalk]. So,
I just have, like, a bunch of

790
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,570
random automations like that.

791
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Dan: [Chuckles] That's awesome.

792
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,789
Bekah: Can you, or one of you,
explain what

793
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:15,630
Zapier is?

794
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:19,634
Vic: Sure. It's plumbing
[chuckles]. So, okay. So, let's

795
00:38:19,634 --> 00:38:23,069
see.

796
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,630
What's the best way to describe
Zapier? So ... let's see. So, I

797
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,880
have a-- it- it- it ties
together various services. It

798
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,130
takes events from

799
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,250
one service and kind of like
pipes them into another. So, as

800
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,680
an example, let's say that I
have ... okay. This is a real

801
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,110
one.

802
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:44,579
So, anytime an event starts on
my calendar, I have Zapier watch

803
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:47,670
for that. And three minutes
before that event starts, it

804
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,890
marks me as "Do Not Disturb".
And, like-- and then, three

805
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,110
minutes

806
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:56,010
after the event ends, it, like,
changes my status back on Slack

807
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,364
to, you know, to clear. I have
some, like, a lot more

808
00:38:58,364 --> 00:39:00,658
complicated

809
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:03,074
ones, where-- like, I have, you
know, I- I run a little script

810
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:10,199
that watches the- the- the race
website, and it looks for, like,

811
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:12,299
a specific word on that website,
and if that word was found, it

812
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:14,399
sends me

813
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,469
a message on Slack, and sends me
a text message, and it lets me

814
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:18,538
know

815
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:19,889
that I should go register. But
you can, like, have this-- you

816
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:21,239
can

817
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:25,139
have it, like, send emails, or I
can have it say that, "Anytime

818
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:26,474
someone fills out this form and
a new record appears in an

819
00:39:26,474 --> 00:39:27,809
Airtable,

820
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:31,650
I want you to do, like, these 15
other things." Like, maybe

821
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,079
fill out an invoice, or send out
an email, or, like, you could

822
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,000
have a-- do a bunch of different
things.

823
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

824
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,954
Vic: And it can be many, many
steps. It can run, like, every

825
00:39:39,954 --> 00:39:41,908
five minutes or something like
that.

826
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:45,750
Bekah: So, it is a time saving
superpower?

827
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:48,869
Vic: It is 100% a time saving
superpower.

828
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:50,849
Dan: Yeah. A-and, the-- for me,
I found that once I've started,

829
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:52,829
like,

830
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:55,004
using it because I read about it
and been like, "That sounds

831
00:39:55,004 --> 00:39:57,179
cool,"

832
00:39:57,179 --> 00:39:58,289
but, you know, not really dug
into it. But once you start

833
00:39:58,289 --> 00:39:59,399
using it,

834
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,510
the ways that you can use it,
like, it changes how your brain

835
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,114
thinks about everything
[laughs]. It's really-- it's-

836
00:40:05,114 --> 00:40:06,718
it's- it's pretty crazy to

837
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,219
think about. The-- what we're
using on Virtual Coffee- Virtual

838
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:12,974
Coffee's site, we have some
random forms that collect

839
00:40:12,974 --> 00:40:14,729
information

840
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:18,389
in various places, for example.
And those forms are submitted on

841
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:23,699
Netlify and so, now, Zapier is
getting notified when that

842
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:27,239
happens, right? So, the form
goes to Zapier, and then, for

843
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:30,749
instance, we are saving the
record in a-- right now in a- in

844
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,860
a Google sheets row. And also,
submitting an issue on GitHub

845
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,825
for it, or whatever to. The--
like, that's just one way that

846
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:38,730
we're-

847
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,130
we're using those-- we're using
Zapier right now. It's ... I

848
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,530
don't

849
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:49,139
know. It's very cool. Could you
tell us about Airtable as well?

850
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:49,139
Vic: Sure.

851
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:50,039
Dan: You- you talked about it a
lot.

852
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,789
Vic: Airtable is just-- I mean,
it's- it's very much

853
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:56,059
like Google sheets or any other
spreadsheet. You know, there are

854
00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:58,279
rows, and you can group them and
sort them. But once again,

855
00:40:58,279 --> 00:41:01,609
it allows you to, like, do
things based on row's changing.

856
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:04,939
And it

857
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,659
has a really, really nice API.
So, I, you know, I've used- I've

858
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:13,280
used it as kind of, like, a back
end for a lot of stuff. There's

859
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,170
a- a site that I built recently,
like, to allow parents to buy

860
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,000
t-shirts

861
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,900
for their kids, and then pay the
invoices, and then I was

862
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,059
using the Airtable for that.
Yeah, there's [laughs] not

863
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:25,218
really much of

864
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:26,989
dark [??] wise. It's very
simple. A lot of people use it.

865
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:28,459
I think they're

866
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,650
like a-- they're one of those,
like, big billion dollar

867
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,280
companies.

868
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,810
Dan: So, if you were building a
service where you had to

869
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,340
st-st-store

870
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,330
content, basically, in- in any
way, at the beginning

871
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:39,300
[crosstalk] that's- that's--
it's ... the first thing you

872
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,280
reach for? Yeah.

873
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Vic: Yeah. And then Access, it
doesn't need an API [??], right?

874
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,320
Bekah: Cool. Can we jump back to
indie hacking for a second? Cuz-

875
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Vic: [Whispers] Yes!

876
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,840
Bekah: -I wanna talk a little
bit about what the community is

877
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:57,000
like and the-- kind of how you
found a place in that community?

878
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:01,650
Vic: Sure. So, I guess it
probably starts when I,

879
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,590
like, started to follow various
people on Twitter. And I

880
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,920
realized that, "Oh, there is a
name for this thing." And, like,

881
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,524
"Oh," it's, like, "I shouldn't
just, like, hide the things that

882
00:42:09,524 --> 00:42:11,038
I do."

883
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:13,800
Like, it's actually good to, you
know, like, share it in public,

884
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,195
right? Then I found
indiehackers.com, which is

885
00:42:15,195 --> 00:42:16,590
probably

886
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,775
one of the largest of these--
and I'm in a few other

887
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:18,960
communities

888
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,019
like that. They're all, like,
Slack communities. Let's see ...

889
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:28,289
wait. [Laughs] What was the rest
of your question?

890
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,200
Bekah: It-- just kinda like, how
you found your place

891
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,690
in the community, or, like, what
the community is like?

892
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,949
Vic: It's-- I find it to be,
like, very welcoming

893
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:40,079
honestly. It's-- there- there
are, of course, a lot of very,

894
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:46,110
very successful people in these
communities. And you gotta- you

895
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,630
gotta make sure that you follow
people that are, you know,

896
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:52,769
slightly out of yours-- slightly
below you, as opposed to just

897
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:54,584
the people that are, like,
wildly su-successful, because

898
00:42:54,584 --> 00:42:56,399
then, you

899
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,150
kinda experience this like
survivorship bias when you

900
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,190
follow people that are just, you
know, making, you know, tons of

901
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:04,230
money or

902
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,719
have very, very successful
products, and you don't really

903
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:08,204
learn anything from them,
because ... I don't know.

904
00:43:08,204 --> 00:43:09,689
They've-

905
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:12,044
they've kind of, you know,
they're-- they- they paint a

906
00:43:12,044 --> 00:43:14,369
much

907
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:16,169
rosier picture of their success
than- than perhaps what is,

908
00:43:16,169 --> 00:43:17,969
like,

909
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:20,519
real [chuckles]. So, I find that
it's important to follow people

910
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:23,069
in

911
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,630
these communities-- like- like
Twitter is probably, honestly,

912
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,190
the best

913
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:30,090
place for this. You know, find
someone that has, like, under

914
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:31,709
1000 followers, under 2000
followers, and is, like, day-

915
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,328
you

916
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:36,000
know, posting daily about their,
you know, what it is they're

917
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,250
building. And a lot of them
share their learnings, like,

918
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,690
successes and failures, and you
learn so much about it. And- and

919
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:49,139
I get so much value from reading
about people's failures. And

920
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:52,949
knowing, you know- you know, I
should not do that. And

921
00:43:52,949 --> 00:43:57,389
similarly, when I find people
that are maybe, like, still just

922
00:43:57,389 --> 00:44:00,150
starting with it, and I'm able
to share, like, my successes and

923
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:03,869
failures with them, I really
enjoy doing that. So, I'm in the

924
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:06,599
Slack community called MicroB2C,
where it's a bunch of

925
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,484
people that build micro business
to consumer products. So ...

926
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:14,369
let's

927
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:16,619
see. So, they, like, you know,
Lunch Money as an example there,

928
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:21,179
like, GG app is another example.
There's lots of

929
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:26,070
different ones there. And it's
just- it's just great to, like--

930
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:28,800
it's great to be able to post
questions to them, for example,

931
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,800
like, "Oh, the Apple store has
changed some policy," like, you

932
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,225
know, and they say, "Oh, you
need to write your terms of

933
00:44:33,225 --> 00:44:34,650
service

934
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,315
to be like this." And, you know,
it saves you from [chuckles]

935
00:44:36,315 --> 00:44:37,980
going through

936
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,849
the hassle of discovering all
this stuff on your own. It's--

937
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,030
they- they're good places. There
also some paid communities. I'm

938
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:48,780
not really a part of any of the-
the paid indie communities.

939
00:44:49,289 --> 00:44:52,260
Bekah: Yeah, I love this idea of
learning

940
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,989
through failures because-- I
don't know. We grow so much, but

941
00:44:54,989 --> 00:44:57,718
also, it

942
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:01,439
helps with our time saving
superpowers [chuckles], right?

943
00:45:01,439 --> 00:45:05,159
Like, you [chuckles] get

944
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:07,439
to-- I don't know-- you get this
knowledge and understanding

945
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:09,719
that

946
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:14,280
you might not get in any other
place, right? And so, some of my

947
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:19,019
favorite conversations recently
have been from people who have

948
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:21,510
been there before and can share
those. That's one of my first

949
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,239
questions, like, "Okay, can you
talk about, like, your failure

950
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:27,869
and- and failures in what you've
learned?" Because then,

951
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:31,409
you know, like, I'm a step ahead
of where I was before. And I

952
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:34,530
don't have to go through that,
like, really painful process.

953
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:39,480
Vic: Exactly, right? So, I- I- I
love those people who

954
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:43,230
share immediately, like, very
forthcoming with you about what

955
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,745
they failed it. That- that's
just, like, such good

956
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:46,260
vulnerability,

957
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,050
and they don't want you to go
through, like, the stuff that

958
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,834
they've gone through. And I'm
not a fan of [chuckles] the

959
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:52,618
people that are

960
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:54,959
like, "Oh, you'll find out." No,
I don't want to [laughs]. I want

961
00:45:54,959 --> 00:45:57,299
you to

962
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,739
tell me. I want, like-- and so,
I bias a little bit toward the

963
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:03,150
oversharing and failures.

964
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:09,000
Dan: One- one of the- one of the
things that you said, sort of in

965
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,869
the same realm of- of following
people that are on your--

966
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,255
basically, on your level of- of
learning in- indie hacking,

967
00:46:15,255 --> 00:46:17,610
I've-- I think

968
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,690
is really good advice for- for
anything, for anything--

969
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,480
Vic: I mean, that's not to say
you shouldn't follow wildly

970
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,000
successful people, right?

971
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Dan: Right. Right.

972
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,500
Vic: You just have to take their
learnings with a mountain of

973
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,000
salt.

974
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Dan: Yes.

975
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,309
Vic: And- and, like, I don't
know-- maybe aspire for their

976
00:46:29,309 --> 00:46:31,618
success, but not necessarily
their

977
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:33,780
journey cuz everyone's journey
is completely different.

978
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,614
Dan: Oh, absolutely. I- I was- I
was going to say, it-- I feel

979
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:39,388
like

980
00:46:39,389 --> 00:46:41,129
it's very good advice. Just ...
I don't know. Learning anything

981
00:46:41,129 --> 00:46:42,869
really,

982
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,564
or ... not just indie hacking,
right? I mean, I- I would give

983
00:46:44,564 --> 00:46:47,594
the same advice to developers. I
don't think I- I had framed it

984
00:46:47,594 --> 00:46:49,169
that

985
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,999
quite the way you did. It-- but
it made me- it made me think

986
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:54,479
that I should start framing it
[chuckles] that way, right? Cuz

987
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:56,129
when people-

988
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:59,010
when people are in a different
phase, their perspective is

989
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:01,949
different even, you know? So, if
somebody is- i-is not just that

990
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:04,440
they have forgotten about the
failures along the way, and they

991
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,840
happen to have a successful
product, you know, but they're--

992
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:08,730
the things they're thinking
about are different if they're

993
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:12,809
managing a successful product,
versus trying to learn how to,

994
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:14,789
you know, trying to- trying to
learn at the beginning. It's

995
00:47:14,789 --> 00:47:16,709
just something

996
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,420
I've been wo-working on a-a-a
lot with Virtual Coffee, you

997
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,130
know? A-and

998
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:22,634
one of the things I've enjoyed
the most is ... becoming close

999
00:47:22,634 --> 00:47:25,109
with

1000
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:28,769
people, you know, at different-
at different phases of- of the

1001
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,739
developer journey, their career
journey, like, you know,

1002
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:33,674
everything. And-- I don't know.
I- I just think it's such good

1003
00:47:33,674 --> 00:47:35,609
advice, you know?

1004
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:36,884
I-it's-- don't-- just don't
always pay attention to the

1005
00:47:36,884 --> 00:47:38,129
people with the

1006
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:40,619
million followers, you know, in-
in whatever.

1007
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,460
Vic: Yeah. I mean, they probably
have valuable things to

1008
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,300
say. It's just that not all of
it is going to work out for you.

1009
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:49,780
But the person that is, like,
closest to you has a actionable

1010
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:53,320
advice right now that, you know,
that is applicable and timely.

1011
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,190
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

1012
00:47:54,628 --> 00:47:56,309
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. We talked
about that in my

1013
00:47:56,309 --> 00:48:01,469
breakout room today in Virtual
Coffee—this idea of processes

1014
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:03,659
and growth—and how-- so many
times you might have a blind

1015
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:05,849
spot,

1016
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,544
especially, like, you know, if-
if you haven't been there

1017
00:48:07,544 --> 00:48:09,239
recently.

1018
00:48:09,568 --> 00:48:13,168
And so, you know, being able to
fill in those blind spots are

1019
00:48:13,168 --> 00:48:17,369
probably the person who is
closer to the problem or your

1020
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:22,259
stage in the journey. And ...
that's incredibly valuable.

1021
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,329
Vic: Totally agree.

1022
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,590
Dan: I mean, I could talk about
this, the low-code, the services

1023
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,170
stuff for hours. I-- it's-- this
is just one of those-

1024
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,039
Vic: What services?

1025
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:33,000
Dan: The- the low-code services.
A-airtable-

1026
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Vic: Oh, yeah.

1027
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,703
Dan: -and Zapier, and just,
like, the way different ways to

1028
00:48:35,703 --> 00:48:37,406
hack--

1029
00:48:37,406 --> 00:48:40,812
like, hook all this stuff
together. Are there any other

1030
00:48:40,812 --> 00:48:44,218
notable low-code

1031
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:48,800
services that you like to use
besides we have mentioned so

1032
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,630
far—Caard, and Airtable, and
Zapier? Are there any- any other

1033
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:52,739
interesting or cool ones that
you like- like to use?

1034
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:55,409
Vic: I think I probably use
those more than

1035
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:59,880
anything else. Trying to think.
But-- I mean ... let's see. No,

1036
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,110
I think the-- I

1037
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:07,739
think those form a bulk of my--
like, I think I can build

1038
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,659
anything with, like, just those
three things. I mean, plus, you

1039
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:13,994
know, I- I don't just use that,
there- there are people that

1040
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:15,329
use,

1041
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:17,579
like, you know, something like,
I think it's called Bubble or

1042
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:19,469
any of those other, like, things
that let you, like, build a

1043
00:49:19,469 --> 00:49:20,908
whole

1044
00:49:20,909 --> 00:49:24,420
app with just, like, you know,
in no-code local stuff, but I

1045
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,160
actually have them as part of my
React app. So, although, like,

1046
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,640
you know, a NextJS page that
just happens to use, you know,

1047
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,380
Airtable

1048
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:35,099
as a- as a thing. And I actually
have a- I have a lightning

1049
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:38,819
talk on, you know, building an-
an Airtable backed app next

1050
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:44,039
month at the Virtual Coffee.

1051
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:45,000
Dan: Yeah. I'm looking--

1052
00:49:44,068 --> 00:49:45,598
Bekah: Oh. This will probably
drop [crosstalk] in

1053
00:49:45,598 --> 00:49:48,298
February-- on February 26th.

1054
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Vic: I'm- I'm looking--

1055
00:49:49,139 --> 00:49:51,329
Dan: [Chuckles] Yeah
[crosstalk]. I'm looking

1056
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:53,519
forward to that talk.

1057
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Vic: I'm looking forward to it.

1058
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:55,814
Dan: And learning more about how
you, like, hook up next-- you

1059
00:49:55,814 --> 00:49:58,109
know, that

1060
00:49:58,110 --> 00:49:59,820
side of it as well. Again, I
could talk about this stuff for

1061
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,699
[chuckles]- for hours.

1062
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,940
Bekah: So, we talked about
having community

1063
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,780
members around your space and
the journey that you can learn

1064
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,979
from too. And so, I'm curious
to-- you know, how close to your

1065
00:50:13,979 --> 00:50:18,178
projects

1066
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:19,739
are they, in terms of the things
that they're making? Like, so

1067
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:24,750
are you just mainly focusing on
people who are doing things

1068
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:28,500
similar to you? Or, you know,
how do you kind of learn from

1069
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,000
the people around you?

1070
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:33,719
Vic: Oh, you mean, like, the-
the specific niche I'm in?

1071
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,500
Nich? Niche? I don't know.

1072
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:36,929
Bekah: Yeah, I know. I say it
both ways too.

1073
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,030
Vic: They're kind of all over
the place actually. I

1074
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,960
follow several people that are,
like, making candles, you know?

1075
00:50:43,019 --> 00:50:46,079
Or-- but, like, you learn
something from that too, right?

1076
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,010
So, this person makes candles,
and, you know, they happen to

1077
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:53,400
use Caard and Shopify to put
together a site really quickly.

1078
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,760
And, you know, it's- it's once
again example of, like, shipping

1079
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,980
quickly, right? And I don't
mean, like, literally shipping

1080
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,210
the candle. But, like, actually,
like, the-- I think the process

1081
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:06,690
for a lot of bootstrap founders
is very similar. So, like in the

1082
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:11,219
candle making example, you could
decide to build a whole business

1083
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:14,369
and build, you know, build an
elaborate site, and then, like,

1084
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:19,710
you could release it, and find
out that no one cares. Or you

1085
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:24,420
could announce that, "Hi, I a
small business solo founder. I'm

1086
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,285
thinking about-", you know,
"-making hand pouring candles."

1087
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:30,090
And it

1088
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,670
turns out that 100 peep- and
then, you know, you launch a

1089
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:36,179
little site on, like, Caard or
Shopify or whatever, and 100

1090
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:39,300
people have pre-sign up, and it
tells you that this-- you

1091
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,820
know, there's interest for this.
And that, you know, it's

1092
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,969
something that you wanna do, and
this particular one—so,

1093
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:49,380
Terra Simply is the candle
company I'm talking about. But

1094
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,500
it's just, like, Shopify, and
she just pours candles, and, you

1095
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,710
know, in her house in Missouri,
and it's, like, really, really--

1096
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,889
so, you know, I learned a ton of
stuff from this. Even though it

1097
00:51:58,889 --> 00:52:02,280
has nothing to do with- with,
like, building software

1098
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:08,460
products, right? And I follow,
like, some people that- that,

1099
00:52:08,489 --> 00:52:10,049
like, you know, have other,
like, direct to consumer stuff,

1100
00:52:10,049 --> 00:52:11,609
like,

1101
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,245
printing t-shirts on demand, you
know? And I learned-- you

1102
00:52:13,245 --> 00:52:14,820
learn--

1103
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,389
you never know what you're going
to learn when you start

1104
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:22,289
following someone. And then you
do. When you realize that, you

1105
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:26,250
know, this is like something
that actually is really useful

1106
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,125
to you. I mean, and I just
learned-- I just like learning

1107
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:30,000
random

1108
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,610
things. Like, I'm super good at
triage [unintelligible]

1109
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:36,570
your team. I just know random
factoids that I shove in

1110
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,040
the back of my head for, like,
someday when it's going

1111
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,510
[chuckles] to be

1112
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:43,170
useful. And- and I find that
just falling, like, kind of this

1113
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,590
diverse group of people, the
only thing in common between all

1114
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:51,239
of them is that they are solo
founders, you know, is actually

1115
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:52,784
really useful. I listened a
bunch of podcasts, too, where I

1116
00:52:52,784 --> 00:52:55,260
learned a lot of stuff from.

1117
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:57,969
Dan: That's a great point. And-
and just the diversity of--

1118
00:52:57,969 --> 00:52:59,888
si-si-since

1119
00:52:59,889 --> 00:53:02,619
it's not all around a
technology, right? I-it's not--

1120
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:04,584
you're- you're gonna have
diverse solutions and- and all

1121
00:53:04,584 --> 00:53:06,219
the different

1122
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:08,064
problems, you know? It's--
that's-- it seems like a very

1123
00:53:08,064 --> 00:53:10,599
cool community to be a part of.

1124
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,168
Vic: Yeah. And you're gonna
learn about, like,

1125
00:53:13,168 --> 00:53:15,688
some tool that someone's using
that, like, you'd never even

1126
00:53:15,688 --> 00:53:17,578
thought of, you know, like, "Oh,
wow. That's gonna be useful for

1127
00:53:17,578 --> 00:53:20,849
me and my preschool thing," or
whatever.

1128
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:24,599
Bekah: All right, Vic. I think
this is been a

1129
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:26,954
fantastic conversation, and I am
so glad to-- that you came here

1130
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:32,250
to have this with us. Where can
our listeners find you?

1131
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:37,639
Vic: You can find me on Twitter
at twitter.com slash

1132
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:43,639
Vic, V-I-C, Vijayakumar,
V-I-J-A-Y-A-K-U-M-A-R. Or you

1133
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:47,780

blog about the most random

1134
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:52,039
things. So, vicvijayakumar.com.
Once again, spelled the same

1135
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:56,000
way. And-- yeah. And I'm gonna
be sending out my first

1136
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:00,000
newsletter this [crosstalk]
month, I think.

1137
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Bekah: Woohoo. [Crosstalk] I'm
sign up for that too.

1138

Dan: Yeah. Yep.

1139
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,420
Vic: A bunch of people that have
signed up. I don't know what I'm

1140
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:04,610
gonna write about yet, but it's
going to be interesting.

1141
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:06,940
Bekah: Listen. I will let you
know I sign up for

1142
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,454
everything that Vic does,
because he's super awesome

1143
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:09,968
[chuckles]. So, I

1144
00:54:09,969 --> 00:54:12,000
can't wait until [crosstalk]
Meet Sweats drops.

1145
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Vic: [Laughs] Thank you.

Bekah: Because [crosstalk] I
know it's gonna

1147
00:54:13,973 --> 00:54:15,946
be life changing. Doesn't
matter. You made it. I'll be

1148
00:54:15,946 --> 00:54:17,919
there [laughs].

1149
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Vic: [Laughs] Who knows what
it's gonna be about?

1150
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:20,530
It's gonna be the fire fest [??]
of our day.

1151
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:25,030
