00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,829
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 1, Episode

2
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:23,699
4 of the Virtual Coffee
podcast. I'm Bekah, and this is

3
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,670
a podcast that features members
of the Virtual Coffee community.

4
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:30,449
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

5
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,990
stages of their coding journey.
And they're here, on this podcast,

6
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,079
sharing their stories and what
they've learned. And we're here

7
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,070
to share it with you. Here with
me today is my co-host, Dan.

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,079
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. In this
episode, you'll hear from Vic

9
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,130
Vijayakumar. Vic is a principal
software engineer at Research

10
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,299
Square, a preprint platform.
When he's not at his day job, he

11
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:56,659
works on his bootstrap startup,
Everyoak, a school management

12
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:00,409
system. Vic is addicted to
building things. Vic sat down

13
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:02,960
with us to tell us about his
experiences with indie hacking,

14
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,650
and gave us his take on when to
ship, what to focus on, and the

15
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,189
value of diverse opinions in
your community among many other

16
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:13,849
things. It was a really great
conversation. And I personally

17
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:17,930
learned a lot. Just as a
production note, this is

18
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,349
actually the second time we've
recorded with Vic. We had a

19
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:24,620
technical mishap and lost the
first recording. But Vic was

20
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,890
gracious enough to sit down with
us for a second time. And so, I

21
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,760
just wanted to say another thank
you to Vic for joining us again.

22
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:34,829
Bekah: We start every episode
of the podcast

23
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,680
like we start every Virtual
Coffee. We introduce ourselves

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,849
with our name, where we're from,
what we do, and a random check-in

25
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,859
question. Today's question is,
if you could add any superpower

26
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,579
to your abilities, what would
you choose? We hope you enjoy

27
00:01:50,579 --> 00:02:05,790
this episode.
Hey, I'm Bekah, I am a frontend

28
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:13,199
developer from a small town in
Ohio. And if I could add one

29
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:13,199
power, I would add telepathy.

30
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:19,830
Dan: Telepathy is dangerous.
Hi, I'm Dan. I'm a frontend

31
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,189
developer from Cleveland. And
I think if I could pick a

32
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:26,939
superpower, it might be
teleportation, that always

33
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,949
seemed like a good and handy
one to have.

34
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:29,789
Bekah: Solid choice.

35
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,469
Vic Vijayakumar: You would save
so much time.

36
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,610
Hi, I'm Vic. I am a full stack
principal engineer from Raleigh,

37
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,560
North Carolina. I'm also an
indie maker. My preferred

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,129
superpower of choice would
probably be to be right the

39
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:48,449
first time, every time.

40
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,360
Bekah: Also would save you time.

41
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,680
Vic: So much time.

42
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:55,650
Bekah: All of these, this is,
this is what it

43
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,319
essentially is all about. We
just want the superpower that

44
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,370
saves us the most time.

45
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,280
Dan: It's really just telling
honestly [laughs]. We're

46
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,120
just telling on ourselves.

47
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,949
Bekah: [laughs] Awesome. Well,
thank you, Vic, for being

48
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:14,729
here with us. We are very happy
to be recording with you. So, we

49
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:18,360
always like to get a little bit
of background on our guests. And

50
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,330
so, we'd love to hear about how
you got into tech.

51
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:27,569
Vic: Sure. Okay. So, I actually
have kind of a

52
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,129
traditional background, if you
will, in the sense that I have a

53
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,340
bachelor's degree in Computer
Engineering from Iowa State

54
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,830
University. But before that,
probably... so, we, we used to own a

55
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:46,560
computer when — not like when I
was super young — but when I was

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,979
in high school. And then
probably the first like

57
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,729
programming thing I did was that
in high school, one of my

58
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:57,419
parents' friends actually, they
invited me to come do like a

59
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:02,159
month-long internship with them.
So, I wrote software for them the

60
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,189
very first time. Like I'd never
written code before. But they

61
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:10,469
helped me kind of write code for
the Kenya duty-free shopping

62
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:16,800
network. So, I've worked in Visual
Basic and [silence] Visual Basic

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,860
and like Access or something
like that. And for that, they

64
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,399
paid me with a US robotics
modem. So, that was my very first

65
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:29,970
quote, unquote paid project for
writing code. And then, let's see.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,220
And then really, I didn't do
anything else kind of like

67
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:39,029
programming related until I went
to college. Where I kind of did

68
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:43,139
a lot of different like tech
support kind of jobs. But my

69
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,500
very first kind of like breakout
into software development, like

70
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,050
web development, came when I got
let go from the support job and

71
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,110
then I was just looking for something
else. And the Office of

72
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,470
Admissions that I was in the university,
they were looking for an entry

73
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,160
level programmer and I was
completely unqualified for this

74
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,699
job, but I applied for it anyway
because someone said I should.

75
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,379
Then I figured, "Okay." [chuckles]
So, I applied for this job. And they

76
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:13,410
pretty much told me that they
said, "You are not qualified for

77
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,629
this role at all. But you sound
confident, and you look like you

78
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:24,000
could learn." And so, they gave me
this job, and which then became

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,220
a full-time role after I
graduated college for a little

80
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,360
bit. And then, when my
girlfriend then wife now moved

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,620
to North Carolina, I got another
job. And I've been at that job

82
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,430
for 14 years. That actually is
the entirety of my journey into

83
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:38,759
tech.

84
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:41,660
Bekah: I love that. And there
are so many hot

85
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,290
tips dropped there, apply for jobs
that you are not qualified for.

86
00:05:46 --> 00:05:47
Vic: Yes. Definitely.

87
00:05:45 --> 00:05:54,740
Bekah: Sound confident. Who knows?
[chuckles] Alright. So, that is how you got

88
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:56,089
into tech. Now. How did you come
to find Virtual Coffee?

89
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,790
Vic: Oh, this is a fun one too.
So, I think I saw

90
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:04,529
one of your tweets, Bekah. It
was April last year, everything

91
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,910
was a dumpster fire. And I think
I hadn't like seen any adults in

92
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,620
a [chuckles] couple months. Because
I, you know, I haven't been going into

93
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,699
work anymore since about
February or so actually. And

94
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:21,000
then I saw your tweet, I think
it was in a CodeNewbie's thread

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,399
or something like that, where you
talked about Virtual Coffee. And

96
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:28,470
I figured, "Hey, I should go make
some new friends." So, that was

97
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,529
probably I- no, I remember
responding to your tweet and

98
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,170
that I missed the first one of
those. And then I came to the

99
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,220
second one. And I think I've
come to just about at least one

100
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,509
session every week or so.

101
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,029
Bekah: Yeah, that is awesome.
You have been here

102
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:45,779
for almost the entirety of
Virtual Coffee. Because we did, I

103
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:49,019
think it was the first week of
April, we're coming up on our

104
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:52,019
one year birthday, or
anniversary, or whatever, very

105
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:52,439
soon.

106
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,139
Dan: It's crazy.

107
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:53,949
Bekah: Right? [chuckles]

108
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:54,759
Vic: Virtual party.

109
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,319
Bekah: [chuckles] It's like,
literally, I have an issue open

110
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:06,360
in a repo that's like birthday party
[chuckles]. Okay. So, we are talking

111
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,490
to you today about indie
hacking. And so, the first time I

112
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,610
heard the term indie hacking, I
thought it meant like somebody

113
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,709
that hacked independently. And [chuckles]
so, let's start there with the

114
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:22,410
actual definition of what indie
hacking is.

115
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:25,350
Vic: Sure. I mean, so, it is
a portmanteau of

116
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,139
independent and hacking, but
hacking in this case actually

117
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,100
refers to... I think indie making
is probably a better term than

118
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,089
indie hacking, that- but I think
right now it's used kind of

119
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:40,620
synonymously with the indiehackers.com
community, which is

120
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,600
like one of the largest
community of indie makers. But

121
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:48,240
it, you know, oftentimes refers
to people that are just

122
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,720
independent, like solopreneur,
like bootstrap developers that

123
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,800
are kind of making and pushing
out various products, you know?

124
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,889
Sometimes you do it for money,
a lot of times you just do it

125
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:03,329
because making things makes you
happy. I fall into the latter

126
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:03,810
category.

127
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,139
Bekah: Alright. So, let's talk
about some of those

128
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,238
things. Because you're making
lots of them, right? [chuckles]

129
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,220
Vic: Yeah, some things end up,
some things end

130
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,980
up going out publicly. And a lot
of things don't. And I'm trying

131
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:22,259
to do a much better thinking of that
this year. So, I built a lot of

132
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:27,240
stuff. And then I used to kind
of have this outlook of, "Oh, I

133
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,339
didn't... this thing is not
perfect." And I'm just going to

134
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:33,149
kind of, you know, not let it go
out. And my, my thing now has

135
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:35,580
been to like push things out as
drafts and kind of talk about

136
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,850
them publicly. Because you never
know who is going to be

137
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,779
interested in the thing you're
building. Let's see. One of my

138
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:47,039
biggest projects, and it's actually
used, it's called the Everyoak.

139
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,570
It's at everyoak.com. It's a
preschool management software.

140
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,629
And it's used by my kids' school
actually. I was really sick of

141
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:00,809
filling out all the various
forms that I had to fill out

142
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:04,080
when I dropped them off. So,
like right now they do COVID

143
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,320
screening, they don't use paper
because they use, you know, Everyoak.

144
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,980
When you're applying, you
have to fill out all these

145
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,620
various forms, you have to fill
out all the allergy information.

146
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,200
And when it changes, you have to
go drop off new forms and all

147
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,129
kinds of things. And I didn't
really want to do that. So, I

148
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:24,899
worked with them to basically
build this thing. And a lot of

149
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,710
different schools were
interested in it. I have two

150
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,519
schools that use it right now.
And, you know, it's profitable.

151
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:36,000
But yeah, that's probably the
biggest one. I've dealt a few

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,629
other things that... so, I run this...
[chuckles] ran, ran this beer festival for

153
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:46,889
the last 10 years in Raleigh.
It's not happening this year,

154
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:50,490
but it happened the last like
nine years or so. Let's see. What

155
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,000
else...

156
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,879
Bekah: Well, I just want to
pause for a second

157
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:58,169
and touch on Everyoak, because
I've got four kids. So, filling

158
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,870
out those forms requires an
incredible amount of time and

159
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,559
ridiculous effort. Because we're
doing it every single year. The

160
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,850
same forms, right? Like there...
why do we have to continually do

161
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,990
this? So, anything that makes
that process easier is in my

162
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,549
book. Like the best thing ever.
[chuckles]

163
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:21,298
Vic: And a lot of parents think
that too. Like this...

164
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:24,178
so, usually what happens, right,
is the schools open up

165
00:10:24,178 --> 00:10:27,839
enrollment, and then it like
goes on for like, a month or so.

166
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,318
And then the schools, the schools
take another like, I don't know,

167
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:36,749
month or so to do the
assignment. And at my, at my

168
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:41,009
three-year-old school, they
actually just finished doing

169
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:44,399
enrollment, and then did a class
assignment and like a few hours

170
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,399
and send all those out already.
And the parents all love their

171
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,239
choices. And meanwhile, you have
all these other schools that are

172
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:56,158
still having their parents drop
off forms. And, and I mean,

173
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:59,788
it's, you know, it's a pandemic
out, even if you're not lazy, I

174
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:03,509
still don't wanna come drop
off forms. And then their class

175
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:07,589
assignment takes so long. Anyway,
it's... the parents love it, the

176
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:11,609
schools love it. And it's, and
it's going decently. You know, I

177
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:14,938
don't expect to get rich off of
what the [laughs] preschool

178
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:18,479
square [??] me, but it makes me
really happy to be able to do

179
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:20,788
this. And it makes me especially
happy that I don't have to fill

180
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:21,389
out forms.

181
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:25,860
Dan: So, so with, with
Everyoak in particular, I, I

182
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,000
imagine with the indie hacking
sort of like mantra is, you

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,259
know, if you-you, you have an idea
of something either in your life

184
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:37,379
or-or-or something that like you
are excited about, or would like

185
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:41,549
make your life easier, and just
kind of go for it, right? With

186
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,779
Everyoak, there's, like, the
motivation from your side as a

187
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:51,779
parent is clear, you know? The...
and, and it seems like a cool problem

188
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:56,009
to solve. And you said you, you- so,
so the next step at, you know,

189
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,370
you can either do it in a, in a
vacuum, or you said you actually

190
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,200
worked with your school to
figure it out. Especially with,

191
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,230
with daycares, and things like
that. That seems like a tricky

192
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,129
thing to step in- into, unless
you have, you know, some

193
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:14,730
assurance that [chuckles], you know, you're
doing it the right way, or the, the

194
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,019
way that a school would want.
So, so how, like, how did that

195
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,029
process work out? Like at the
beginning, at least?

196
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:23,580
Vic: Yeah. So, you said the
right thing there,

197
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,549
which is that it... so, it
definitely is easier to work on

198
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:29,340
things that scratch your own
itch. Because you just have to

199
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,960
talk to fewer people, right? But
in order for something to be... I

200
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,059
mean, it depends on how you
define success, right? If you

201
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,879
want to build something for the
sake of building something, and

202
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,360
just get those, you know, get
that muscle memory working of

203
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,940
just building things and getting
them out, you know, maybe you

204
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,269
want to only scratch your own
itch. But if you're trying to

205
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:53,789
monetize it, or if you're trying
to help people other than

206
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:57,059
yourself, you're gonna have
to go talk to people. It's

207
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,450
definitely easier when there's...
when you're working with just

208
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,649
one school, right? But then the,
the fun thing is... so, I built

209
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,649
something very custom to that
school. But then I saw things in

210
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:11,309
their process that I could
improve. So, I would work on like

211
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,100
those improvements, and then
show it to them. And they were

212
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,519
really happy with what I did. And
they just... they kind of just...

213
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,450
once, once they realized that I
was making their process better

214
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,200
for them, they just let me just
do the things that I thought

215
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,230
were good ideas. And [chuckles], and
then when the next school joined up,

216
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,679
I said, "Here's a system that
works really well for school

217
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:38,070
one." And they said, "Great. If it
works for them, it'll probably

218
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39
work for us."

219
00:13:39 --> 00:13:39
Dan: Sure [chuckles].

220
00:13:40 --> 00:13:46,830
Vic: So, at this point, [chuckles] I'm basically, you know,
becoming an expert in building workflows for, for preschools.

221
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:50,639
And they trust that I know what
I'm doing because some other

222
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,960
school uses it. So, it's kind of
like, I don't know what to call

223
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,309
it. It's kinda just like, I
don't know what you call it. Cloud

224
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,970
by... by just faking it, I guess.

225
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,279
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. No, that's,
that's really interesting. And,

226
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:08,250
and, yep, I don't know. I lost my, I
lost my train of thought there [laughs].

227
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,610
Vic: I mean, I've worked on
a few other things

228
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,789
there too, that like, don't
necessarily kind of... are not that

229
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:17,960
easy in terms of thinking about
how to make it work. So, let's

230
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,440
see. So, I have like... I mean, you,
do you want me to tell you about things

231
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,159
that didn't work? [crosstalk 00:14:22]
Because it's [chuckles]-

232
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:22,850
Bekah: Yeah!

233
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:25,168
Dan: Absolutely. I mean,
absolutely.

234
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,690
Vic: Yeah. And then you know,
and it, and it was a thing

235
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,299
that I learned. I definitely did
learn something there as well.

236
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:34,320
So, I built something called-
well, it was, it was called Dog

237
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,649
Ears because I just found this
picture of this dog I really

238
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:40,019
liked with droopy ears and I was
like, that's a good name for

239
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,779
this thing. So, it was just a...
it's just a product that would

240
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:46,470
help you like search through
your, your Twitter likes and

241
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,809
retweets and whatnot, because
Twitter's interface itself

242
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:53,399
doesn't like let you do that really
well. So, I built this thing. And

243
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,549
my goal was just to like, see
how fast I could build this

244
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:01,350
thing. And it took me about
like, an hour a day, for 12 days

245
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:07,139
is what it took. And ultimately,
it failed because I was using

246
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,110
like a trial version of Algolia
and I realized that if I

247
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:15
had to pay for, like, [crosstalk 00:15:12] it was just
not sustainable at the price that I could charged for.

248
00:15:12 --> 00:15:12
Dan: Yeah.

249
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17,460
Vic: And so, I just let it die.
So, the

250
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,769
website for that is still out
there, but you can't really sign

251
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:23,490
up. And, but I learned like a ton
of stuff. I learned about, like,

252
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,480
all the wrong things you could
choose. I learned about, like,

253
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,179
needing to make sure that
something was sustainable before

254
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,600
you, you know, spend time on it.
And the thing is this wasn't

255
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,539
even a, you know, this wasn't
even like something that scratch

256
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:39,120
my own itch because ultimately,
I didn't care about this

257
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,679
problem [crosstalk 00:15:39], you
know? So, I just let that one die.

258
00:15:39 --> 00:15:39
Dan: [chuckles] Yeah.

259
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,210
Vic: But I learned a ton of stuff out
of it. I learned a lot of new tools

260
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,179
that I had not previously used.
So, you know, I got something out

261
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:53,129
of it. And I consider that a win.

262
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:56,580
Bekah: For sure. I think that
the framing of what a

263
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,470
win is, is really important
there, right? Because you are

264
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,740
learning something, you can take
that to a different project,

265
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,090
maybe it's not going to be the
same product to that you're making.

266
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,169
But now you have experience that,
that guides the next thing

267
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:15,690
that's going to be better. And
if it's something that you're

268
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,549
interested in, then, great.

269
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:20,818
Vic: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and
I have a lot of things

270
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:23,938
like that, right? Where the next
thing I build, I'm not going to

271
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:26,969
be starting at zero, because I'm
going to take whatever, you

272
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:30,479
know, all the failed parts- all
the good parts of Dog Ears that

273
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,818
you know, didn't fail, I'll
probably start from like,

274
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:35,818
something where I already have a
site, I already have a way to

275
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:39,568
charge people, I already have,
you know, all of that going. And

276
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:42,808
then I saved myself a whole lot
of time. And I think it, it

277
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:47,399
definitely is helpful like that
way to have like a framework,

278
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,458
you know, a framework of how you
would do things because it means

279
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:54,298
you don't spend time chasing,
chasing, you know, shiny things

280
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:58,469
of like, "Oh, let me like build a
whole new framework of, like, how

281
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:01,229
to do this," instead of you're
focusing just on like, "What

282
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:05,128
problem am I going to solve?"
It's been helpful for me anyway.

283
00:17:05,848 --> 00:17:07,499
I don't know if I, like, said
that clearly. But- [chuckles]

284
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,680
Bekah: I just learned so much
from everything

285
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,670
that you just said. I love that. Like,
and... th-th-this starting with, you

286
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,569
know, this idea of, you're not
starting at zero the next time,

287
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,779
right? Because there's this like
sense of like, "Oh, I failed at

288
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:25,200
something. And now I have to start
over." But you're, you're not

289
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:29,579
starting over at zero.

290
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:30
Dan: Yeah, I think another, another-

291
00:17:29 --> 00:17:30
Vic: Yeah. Totally, totally true.

292
00:17:31 --> 00:17:38,400
Dan: -sorry. I was gonna say, I think another interesting
aspect of that is that in... I mean, we can all agree to

293
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,539
not view this as a failure, or
at least as a negative thing,

294
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:48,599
right? But knowing when to pull
the plug or stop, you know, stop

295
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:52,410
putting effort or money or time into
a, into a, into a thing. I think

296
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,769
like a side project like this.
Do you have like a... you

297
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:58,259
mentioned you had sort of lost
interest in the problem itself,

298
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:01,319
which is [chuckles] I'm sure a big
warning sign, but do you have like a

299
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:05,849
rubric that you use for your own
side projects of when to, to leave?

300
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:07,259
Or is it just like when it feels like
[crosstalk 00:18:07] I've done this?

301
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,650
Vic: Yeah. So, this is- That's
a, that's a very good

302
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,990
question. And it's actually kind
of deep, right? It's... so, I have

303
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,470
this problem. Had? Have? I don't
know if I still have it or not.

304
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:24,480
But it's [chuckles], it's this thing of
like... I, I like, I like starting new

305
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,970
things, far more than I like to...
so, I like starting new things.

306
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:32,730
And that, you know, that's the
kind of like the most exciting

307
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,789
part of it for me, right? But it,
but it's, but it's a bit of an-

308
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,430
like a, a negative addiction, right,
to start new things but to not

309
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,509
actually like keep working on
them? So, I have to kind of plan

310
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:49,410
for the possibility that I'm
going to lose the interest in that

311
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:57,059
thing. So, the way that I kind of
work to mitigate that is that I

312
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:00,150
start to... I have to start to
launch things as soon as

313
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,470
possible. And if I use the, the
preschool management thing as an

314
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,210
example, right? So, the moment I
launched it, and rail people

315
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,509
started using it, it was no
longer a thing that I could just

316
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:14,910
say no one uses this, I can just
shut this down and move on to

317
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:15
something else.

318
00:19:16 --> 00:19:16
Dan: Yeah.

319
00:19:16 --> 00:19:23,279
Vic: Now there... now first of all, I have proved that
someone wanted to use it, you know, and the real

320
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,470
consequences to me, I'd be
ending it and not working on it

321
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,849
anymore. And the fact that
someone was using it then made

322
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:34,349
it a lot more fun to like keep
working on it-

323
00:19:33 --> 00:19:33
Dan: Yeah.

324
00:19:33 --> 00:19:40,319
Vic: -so, it kind of... like kind of... it kind
of helped that situation. But [laughs] not using

325
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,920
that example, when do I know
when to stop working on a thing?

326
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,490
When I'm not having fun with it.
Because if I'm not having fun

327
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:53,009
doing something, I'm not gonna
keep doing it. So, people often

328
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:57,000
like talk about like, how do you
choose a problem to work on? And

329
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:00,000
so, there's several schools of
thought on this. One is that, you

330
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,599
know, work on something that is
going to like, make you rich

331
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,940
for example. I don't know.
That's, that's a, that's an

332
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,720
actual rubric some people go
with. Or work on something that

333
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,230
like you're passionate about.
Maybe that works for you. Or

334
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,859
like work on something that, I
don't know, some other, some

335
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:19,980
other rubric for you. And I
guess if it's not- if you're not

336
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,400
having fun with it, if you're no
longer motivated to keep doing

337
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,430
that thing, that's probably the [chuckles]
time to move on. Or at least,

338
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,460
you know, pause it. If it's the
sort of thing that can like,

339
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:35,039
keep going while you can focus
on something else, then that's

340
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,130
good. If it's the sort of thing
that if you stopped working on

341
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,730
it will just die off... I don't
know. Maybe you should have

342
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,180
launched earlier or, I don't
know. It's totally fine, right?

343
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47
It's totally fine to just stop
working on the thing.

344
00:20:47 --> 00:20:47 
Dan: Yeah.

345
00:20:47 --> 00:20:48,809
Vic: If that's what makes
[chuckles] you happy.

346
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,170
Dan: Yeah, that's, that's a
struggle that I have had with-with

347
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,910
things like this is, is... it's sort
of guilt, you know, I mean, like

348
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,910
losing interest as a kind of
automatically stop working on

349
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,660
something if nobody else is
asked me to.

350
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,009
Vic: [laughs] My abandoned projects
need friends.

351
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:04,769
Dan: Right? Like [laughs], I don't
know, or guilt, or, I don't

352
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:07,230
know, shame even, you know, I
mean, it's not like deep, dark

353
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,049
shame. But it's still... it's like,
I have these, like, random side

354
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:13,109
projects, there's links to them
on my site probably, somewhere,

355
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,099
you know, from years ago. And
it's, it's sometimes it's hard

356
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:23,970
to not fe- not feel bad, you know, or-or
embarrassed of-of-of a thing where-where

357
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,880
you can clearly look at this and
say, "Oh, this is a failed side

358
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,210
project," right? Like [chuckles], you
know, a thing that went nowhere.

359
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,589
Whereas the framing of this was
a side project, and it was kind

360
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:38,309
of fun. And I learned some
stuff. And you know, it, I think

361
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:42,660
it's a very healthy and good way
to frame things. And it seems

362
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,359
like you have [chuckles], it seems
like you personally have that most of

363
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:47,069
that figured out pretty well.

364
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,240
Vic: I hope so.

365
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,529
Bekah: Alright. I wanna touch
back on this idea of when

366
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:54,750
to launch, you said, "Well, like
maybe you didn't launch early

367
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:59,190
enough." So, I know there's like
lots of different perspectives

368
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,390
on when you should launch and
how much you should have done,

369
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,049
what features you have planned
out? Or have you completed most

370
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:11,130
of the features on your list? So,
I want to know, what is your

371
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,089
personal take on, on process and
when to launch?

372
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,049
Vic: You should launch as soon
as you feel

373
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:21,809
ready. That's the thing. But
sometimes you have to force

374
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:27,000
yourself to, to accept that
something is ready. Otherwise,

375
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:30,089
you will keep waiting, and
waiting, and waiting. And it's

376
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:32,730
possible, you might lose the
motivation to launch it, right?

377
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:36,539
So, and the thing is, I think
when I say the word launch,

378
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:39,990
people often think like press
release, or like tweet about it,

379
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:42,960
it doesn't have to be that. You
could silently, quietly launch

380
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,819
and tell nobody. But it might
just be a psychological win for

381
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:51,630
you to know that though that
thing is on, you know, on

382
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,630
production on a secret URL, but I
can access it, and it works, and I

383
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,559
can log into it, and I can use it
might be the psychological win

384
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,119
that you need to keep working on
it. And that's totally fine. Or

385
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,779
sometimes you can just launch
something with just a sign-up URL

386
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:10,440
that says "Coming Soon" and "Sign
Up For This", which is good

387
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,859
enough, right, for you to...
for at least like drum up some

388
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,859
excitement or whatever. But
yeah, I would say that, that is

389
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:21,599
entirely up to you. But I like
to default toward pushing

390
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,890
something out early and then
iterating on that as opposed to

391
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,859
waiting a long time and then
like ending up with, you know,

392
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,359
dead rock or something like that.

393
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:35,130
Bekah: I feel that also deeply.
I am the person that

394
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,000
creates things and then doesn't
put them out there. And I was

395
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,670
working on this project earlier
this year. It was a very, like,

396
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,920
deeply personal, but I had like
quietly launched it just so I

397
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,970
knew about it, and one other
person, and I had said like, "You

398
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,640
know, I'll probably put this out
to the public in about a month

399
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,150
or so." Well they missed that in
about a month or so and then

400
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59
like posted about it on social
[crosstalk 00:23:58] media.

401
00:23:58 --> 00:23:58
Vic: Oh, no.

402
00:23:59 --> 00:24:05,220
Bekah: And I was like, "Okay, well [laughs], I guess
somebody pushed me off the diving board and, and now I'm

403
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,099
going for this." Which in that
sense like was really good. The

404
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:13,019
project wasn't done, I scrambled
for a couple of days, but also, I

405
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:18,329
might not have launched the
project had somebody not been

406
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:19,170
talking about it.

407
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:25,029
Vic: You know, if, if, if you
push something out and if

408
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:28,839
someone starts to use it and
their feedback to you is this is

409
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,289
good but it could use more,
that's good feedback. I would

410
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:37,210
rather that then no one use it,
you know? It's... yeah. I would

411
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,140
totally, I would totally get negative
attention [chuckles] then like

412
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,650
none at all for, you know,
something that I launched. But

413
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,200
I'm glad you were able to do
that. Like that would prob-

414
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,660
that situation would probably
stressed me out if someone did a,

415
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,970
an announcement of something
that I built but I

416
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:52,869
wasn't ready for it yet.

417
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:53,950
Bekah: It stressed me out.
It did. [laughs]

418
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:00,880
Dan: [laughs] Can you talk a little
bit about, like some tools you

419
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,990
use to make, to make this process
easier, you know, when you're

420
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,640
working on side projects, things
like that?

421
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:11,430
Vic: Yeah. So, I use a lot of
no-code tools actually...

422
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,210
low-code tools, I should say. So,
I'm not one of those people that

423
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:20,309
like, builds entirely with
no-code stuff. But I, I do use

424
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:23,369
like, Airtable and Zapier are
probably like my two biggest

425
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:26,819
things where I just, you know,
duct tape things together when I

426
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:31,589
need to get them to work really
fast. So, the other day, I had

427
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:35,549
this, I had this like, I don't
know. I, I thought of this joke.

428
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:39,420
And it was kind of a really
silly joke. And I, and I told

429
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:44,039
you, Dan, or I said it's a, it's
a community for people who are

430
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,890
working from home to talk to
each other. And then there's

431
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,789
sweatpants, it can be called
meetsweats.com, and then I

432
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,799
laughed about it for so long.

433
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:57,339
Dan: [laughs] I was... because Vic, Vic
Slacked me this on a Friday night. I was

434
00:25:57,339 --> 00:26:02,019
watching TV with, with my wife,
with Emily. And she had to pause

435
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,910
what we were watching because I was laughing
so hard [laughs]. And then... oh, I

436
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,640
shared it with her too, which she
also laughed. But I was just

437
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,759
sitting there on the couch... on
my phone laughing and it was

438
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:14,140
just about meetsweats.com
[laughs].

439
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:18,079
Vic: And, and I was like, "Surely
that's already a website."

440
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:21,259
So, I went there, and it didn't
exist, and the domain was

441
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:25,400
available. So, I bought, you
know, meet, like M-E-E-T,

442
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,539
sweats, like, you know, sweatpants.
So, I bought meetsweats.com [chuckles]

443
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:34,789
for $4 because I was like, this
is... the... like $4 is gonna be

444
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:38,299
worth it for me. And then I
think I spent like the next two

445
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:42,740
hours. So, I put my kids to bed.
And I was still kind of giggling

446
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,809
about it while I, while I was brushing
their teeth, and they're like,

447
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:49,670
"What is it?" I was like, "Nothing. It's
nothing." We'll get it. I put them

448
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:54,049
to bed and, and it feels like
forever, but it was just last

449
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:57,859
week. And while they were, while
they were, while they were

450
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:01,789
falling asleep, I just sat in a
room with my laptop and I built

451
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:04,759
out the site for this and
launched it. And it took

452
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,769
probably like, I don't know,
like an hour and a half or so.

453
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:12,170
And for that... so, I just, you know, I went
on Carrd, C-A-R-R-D dot co, and I- so,

454
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,859
that's a, that's a site that I
use for this, where I push out a

455
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:20,240
site, and I built a form on the
site, and it uses Airtable and

456
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,829
it like people can sign up to be
notified. And like all of these

457
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:27,529
are super helpful. And it's a
way to early launch something,

458
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:31,309
right? While you decide if this joke
is [chuckles] worth [??] any more than

459
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:34,880
like the airtime we're already
got. And whether or not... the

460
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,819
thing is... the funny thing is like
something like 15 people signed

461
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:40,069
up to be early notified [crosstalk 00:27:39]
after it's made up.

462
00:27:39 --> 00:27:41,549
Bekah: It's me. Number one
[laughs].

463
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:45,359
Vic: Yep. [laughs] You were the
first sign-up.

464
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:47,039
Bekah: Founding member.

465
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,759
Vic: [laughs] So, this gonna be
a good example

466
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:56,220
of like, you know, or like... I
mean, I don't know anymore. Like,

467
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:00,900
is it a joke? Well, it's... if it's, if
it's just a joke, you know, like, all

468
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,500
these people want to be, want to
be notified of like when this

469
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,950
thing launches. And then a few
other people like, quote tweeted

470
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,970
it with their ideas of what it
should be. And, you know, I

471
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,700
think this is kind of a vote for
like building in public, right?

472
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:18,359
You don't really know what it
should be yet, but you take ideas

473
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:23,220
from the community. And you
know, this whole thing, so was

474
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:28,769
Carrd plus Airtable, and I think
that's pretty much all it was.

475
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:34,619
And it went out there. But a few
other tools I use are Zapier like

476
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:38,549
I said, and then I use you know,
things like Mailchimp to, to

477
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:42,660
manage, like newsletters and
stuff. But otherwise, I have a

478
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,410
pretty traditional... just to- not
traditional, I guess. I should

479
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:52,529
say, I have like a skeleton... I
have a skeleton project, that I just

480
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:56,339
spin up for everything. And that
way, I'm not spending my time,

481
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,250
you know, trying to figure out,
"Oh, what should I choose for

482
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,089
this project that I'm building?"
And it's just something that

483
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:07,500
I've kind of forced myself to
not do anymore. Where I don't...

484
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,140
like it [laughs] kinda... unfortunately,
it removes the excitement of it.

485
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,680
Like, I used to be like, "Oh, I'm
going to do this thing." And then

486
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,589
I would spend the first week of
it just like building the

487
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,710
authentication and doing all
these little things. And now I

488
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,740
just know that I don't have to
do any of that. I could just

489
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,119
spin up the skeleton project and
just start off. And I know that

490
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,609
at like minute one, it can
already charge people, which

491
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:36,539
means that I focus on like the
actual problem instead of like

492
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:41,099
the distracting other parts of
it. So, that's really helped me

493
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:45,210
out. It also means that I start
fewer things. Because it means

494
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,400
that I have to like actually
come up with like what I'm going

495
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,440
to do before I, you know, I start
on it.

496
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:55,378
Dan: I think that [chuckles], I think
that's great. I think that's a

497
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:58,348
great and sort of newer way to
think about a lot of this stuff.

498
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,249
And as a, I mean, I, you know, as
I've been a developer for a long

499
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:06,209
time, and it's natural to like s-s,
you know, think of a problem and

500
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:11,159
say, "Okay, I'm going to start
writing React from scratch," and

501
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:15,868
you know, or-or-or whatever it is.
Because, because, I don't know,

502
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:21,028
because that's what my job was, you
know, or is. And like... sometimes it's

503
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:27,028
hard to not do that. But making
it easy for yourself to, to get

504
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:31,288
going and solving the actual problem
is-is-is seems very... like a

505
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:34,078
very good way to do things like
that. Especially if you're

506
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:36,209
starting things from scratch,
often, right?

507
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,130
Vic: Uh-huh. This year, I plan
to do that many, many more

508
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,450
times. Like I, I was hoping to
like... I was hoping to start a

509
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:50,069
new project every month. Or, I
don't know. I don't, I haven't

510
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:53,339
yet decided, but it's [chuckles] January
28th that I think Meet Sweats is

511
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:58,019
probably like the, [chuckles] the project
of this month. But in February, I'm,

512
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:00,450
I'm gonna have to decide like, how
much more work I'm going to do

513
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,660
on that. Or if I'm going to pick
a new project. It's just, it's

514
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,410
just training, I guess, to like,
you know... To just push more

515
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,349
things out [silence] in public.

516
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,039
Bekah: Yeah, I really like that
mindset. And I,

517
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:19,710
I've got 37 projects. So, if you
would like one, I will let you

518
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:24
do it for [crosstalk 00:31:20]
February [laughs].

519
00:31:20 --> 00:31:21
Vic: No, thanks.

520
00:31:24 --> 00:31:35,099
Bekah: Yeah. The point Dan was making before about
using things... there's, there's a tendency to devalue

521
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:41,400
tools that make projects easier
if you could use something

522
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,720
harder, like React, right? Or
building a site from scratch

523
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,339
rather than using a template.
And I wish that more people were

524
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:56,130
talking about how you can do
these things to spin up

525
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,890
projects, like what you're doing
or saying, like, look, this is

526
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:03,000
just as valuable as a site
that's done in React because

527
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,869
who really cares if they are
solving the same problem? [chuckles]

528
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,660
Vic: Exactly. Yeah, your customer-
your user doesn't know

529
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,410
what you did. I mean, they don't
care what programming language

530
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,750
you're using, they don't care
what CSS framework you're using,

531
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,630
they just care that you're
making their life easier. You

532
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,539
know, it does... I don't think-
I don't believe that, like, you

533
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:25,140
know, if you use something
easier, like, I don't know,

534
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,289
like, I mean, you, you know,
you're playing, you're playing a

535
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:31,589
video game, I guess it's
entirely only in your head as to

536
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:34,619
you know, what mode you were
playing it on. It really doesn't

537
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,640
matter ultimately. I think, I
think I like just thought of

538
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,710
something a little bit more
insightful for the sake of that,

539
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,279
but [chuckles] that's all I can think
of right now. I mean, I use lots of

540
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:47,369
low-code or no-code things all
over the place. It's... and you

541
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:50,730
know, it's not even just for
starting, right? Sometimes... so,

542
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,309
like that, that beer festival
that I, that I talked about

543
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,400
earlier, you know, I don't
remember what it used to be at

544
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,859
the very beginning, but it's
been running on Airtable for

545
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:03,059
like, I don't know, like four or
five years now. It works just fine,

546
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:04
you know?

547
00:33:04 --> 00:33:04
Dan: Yeah.

548
00:33:05 --> 00:33:10,890
Vic: I, and I will never replace it. I'm not going to,
you know, spend a bunch of time moving it over to Postgres

549
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,900
or whatever. It works.

550
00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:17,970
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. We, we,
in... Virtual Co- one of

551
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:22,470
the Virtual Coffees last week,
or maybe Tuesday? We were...

552
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:27,809
somebody was asking about, like,
if, if they were freelancing, and

553
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:29,910
somebody asked them to make a
site, you know, like, what,

554
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:35,160
what, what they should do,
right? And... And some of the

555
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,589
answers at the beginning were,
"Oh, just write it in, you know,

556
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,470
I don't know, React or Gatsby or
something, or, you know, even

557
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:43,470
11ty," and, and then we kind of
were talking about it for a

558
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,349
while, and especially if
somebody's paying you to do it,

559
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,980
they also probably don't care [chuckles]
what technology it's written in

560
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:54,180
or what you use. And if you are
able to stand up a site, like

561
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,630
you have that- like using Caard,
for example, right, for a...

562
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,599
like Caard is-is-is a service that...
is basically a landing page

563
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:04,259
service, right? And you can add
a form to it, I think, and maybe,

564
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:05,730
maybe something else, but-

565
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,650
Vic: So, I have an example about
this actually.

566
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:13,199
Where... so, when I started Everyoak,
it used to be just in the

567
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,090
Airtable form. Where... so, it was
just, it was a... so, it was a React

568
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,940
page. It was a, it was a React
form, but then it's submitted to

569
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,440
Airtable, and that was actually
it. Because it- there was no

570
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,699
login or anything like that, you
know? Parents would come like

571
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,909
fill out their application. And
then the rest of it kind of got

572
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:37,110
built around that. And like, it
ran that way for two years,

573
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,960
where all it did was submit to
an Airtable. Like, I didn't move

574
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,559
it over to like MySQL or
anything like that for a good

575
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:47,309
solid two years, and it worked
just fine, you know. The

576
00:34:47,309 --> 00:34:51,420
parents don't care. It still
makes their lives easier. And

577
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:53,909
then the reason why I moved it was
ultimately because [chuckles] I

578
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:56,820
exceeded Airtable's like free
limits. Not because I thought

579
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,570
like, "Oh, I'm like, I'm doing
something that-" you know, like,

580
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,389
you know, "-really good programmers
don't do," or anything

581
00:35:03,389 --> 00:35:06,570
like that, you know. I moved it
because you- I just didn't want to

582
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:10
pay money for, for what I was
doing. That's fine with it.

583
00:35:10 --> 00:35:10
Dan: Yeah.

584
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,869
Vic: And I don't think people should be like,
"Oh, if I use a-", you know, "-low-code

585
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:18,960
or no-code tool, I'm not a good
programmer," or something like

586
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,159
that. That's, if, if, you know, if
someone is telling you that, they

587
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:24,300
don't know what they're talking about.

588
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:30,869
Dan: Yeah. I, I mean, I agree.
And the framing of, of, of how a

589
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:36,269
person values themselves and
their abilities, I feel like... is

590
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:38,909
either starting to shift, or,
or maybe I'm just like finding

591
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:43,019
better vocabular- you know,
vocabulary about it. But... that

592
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:46,800
like... If a client, for instance...
I mean, I, I, I'm independent

593
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,280
developer. So, clients are the
way I think about a lot of this

594
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,829
stuff, right? But if a client is
paying, like is, is paying you,

595
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,239
they're not paying you for code
or, you know, React or whatever,

596
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:00,630
right? They're paying you to get the
thing that they want [chuckles], right?

597
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,989
They're paying you to have the
daycare, like management

598
00:36:03,989 --> 00:36:09,480
software done, not to do it in
the most, you know, detailed way

599
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,869
that some other judgy person will
judge you for [chuckles], right?

600
00:36:12 --> 00:36:13
Vic: [chuckles] Exactly.

601
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:18,000
Dan: That- they don't care. And so,
you know, my point is just like to

602
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,329
provide value is the thing, is
the thing that you're working on.

603
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:25,619
Not, not that you're working on
becoming like a React expert,

604
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:26,969
or whatever, you know?

605
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:29,190
Vic: Right. And, and, you know,
it depends, of course,

606
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,989
whether you are doing this in a
job or... but actually, even at my

607
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:38,820
day job, we actually use a lot
of Zapier and, and Airtable. Like

608
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,610
we had- we're on the enterprise
levels of both Zapier and Airtable,

609
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:46,110
because like, you got to maximize,
you know, your value.

610
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,400
And we don't want to be building
all these... so, this is just going

611
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,190
to come off as like product
placement for Zapier or Neotel

612
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:58,110
but, [laughs] you know, there's, there's so much
stuff that we just don't want to... all this

613
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00
duct tape we just don't need to
do.

614
00:37:00 --> 00:37:00
Dan: Yeah.

615
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,539
Vic: Because it like, it's cheaper to pay for,
for those tools on a monthly basis than it

616
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:09,300
is to spent any amount of time,
like building all the plumbing.

617
00:37:09 --> 00:37:09
Dan: Yep.

618
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,929
Vic: That, that's [laughs] all I'll say about
that. So this [chuckles] doesn't become a

619
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:14,940
huge, like, endorsement or any-

620
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:16,920
Dan: No, it's true though. And
cheaper. Like if you build

621
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,550
for the hour, or if your employee
or whatever, like your- anybody's

622
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,289
time is worth money and
somebody's paying for it

623
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,650
eventually [chuckles], right? So, anytime
you can save yourself time in,

624
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,880
you know, a productive way that...
that it's like easy to, it's an easy

625
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:36,900
win [chuckles]. It's an easy decision. I
love it. I... Zapier for it like... I have

626
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,110
just started scratching the
surface of Zapier for over the last

627
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,860
couple months. I think based on
your recommendation. But it's

628
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,840
just been, I don't know, it's been
a revelation.

629
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:49,050
Vic: I kind of use it all over
the place. I have

630
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,739
some zaps that just told me like...
okay. So, this is a pre-2020

631
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:56,250
story. But I have some zaps
that's- that just tells me like...

632
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:59,340
it monitors there is like
races that I used to run — like

633
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:03,059
road races — and it just tells me
when like, registration opens up

634
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:05,550
for those races, so I could [chuckles]
go register and get bid number

635
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:09,570
one [crosstalk 00:38:06]. So, I just have like
a bunch of random automations like that.

636
00:38:06 --> 00:38:07
Dan: [chuckles] That's awesome.

637
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,789
Bekah: Can you, or one of you,
explain what

638
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:15,630
Zapier is?

639
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:23,070
Vic: Sure. It's plumbing [chuckles].
So, okay. So, let's see.

640
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,630
What's the best way to describe
Zapier? So... let's see. So, I

641
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:32,130
have a- it, it, it ties together various
services. It takes events from

642
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,250
one service and kind of like,
pipes them into another. So, as

643
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:40,110
an example, let's say that I
have... okay. This is a real one.

644
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:44,579
So, anytime an event starts on my
calendar, I have Zapier watch

645
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:47,670
for that. And three minutes
before that event starts it

646
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:52,110
marks me as "Do Not Disturb". And
like- and then three minutes

647
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:56,010
after the event ends, it like
changes my status back on Slack

648
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:00,659
to, you know, to clear. I have
some like a lot more complicated

649
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:05,489
ones, where... like I have, you
know, I, I run a little script that

650
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:10,199
watches the, the, the race
website, and it looks for like a

651
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:14,400
specific word on that website, and
that word was found, it sends me

652
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,539
a message on Slack, and sends me
a text message, and lets me know

653
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:21,239
that I should go register. But
you can like have this- you can

654
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:25,139
have it like send emails, or I
can have it say that, "Anytime

655
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:27,809
someone fills out this form and
a new record appears in an Airtable,

656
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:31,650
I want you to do like these
15 other things." Like maybe

657
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,239
fill out an invoice, or send out
an email, or like, you could have

658
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37
a do a bunch of different
things.

659
00:39:37 --> 00:39:37
Dan: Mm-hmm.

660
00:39:38 --> 00:39:41,909
Vic: And it can be many, many steps. It can run
like every five minutes or something like that.

661
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:45,750
Bekah: So, it is a time saving
superpower?

662
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:48,869
Vic: It is 100% a time saving
superpower.

663
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:52,829
Dan: Yeah. A-and, the... for me,
I found that once I started like

664
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:57,179
using it, because I read about it
and been like, "That sounds cool,"

665
00:39:57,179 --> 00:39:59,400
but, you know, not really dug into
it. But once you start using it,

666
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,510
the ways that you can use it,
like it changes how your brain

667
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,719
thinks about everything [laughs]. It's
really, it's, it's, it's pretty crazy to

668
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,219
think about the... what we're
using on Virtual Coffee, Virtual

669
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:14,730
Coffee's site, we have some random
forms that collect information

670
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:18,389
in various places for example.
And those forms are submitted on

671
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:23,699
Netlify, and so now Zapier is
getting notified when that

672
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:27,239
happens, right? So, the form
goes to Zapier, and then, for

673
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:30,750
instance, we are saving the
record in a right now in a, in

674
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,860
a Google sheets row, and also
submitting an issue on GitHub

675
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,730
for it- or whatever to. That, like,
that's just one way that we're

676
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:43,530
we're using those. We're using
Zapier right now. It's, I don't

677
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:49,139
know, it's very cool. Could you
tell us about Airtable as well?

678
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:50,039
You've talked about it a lot.

679
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,789
Vic: Airtable is just, I mean,
it's it's very much

680
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:56,059
like Google sheets or any other
spreadsheet... you know, there are

681
00:40:56,059 --> 00:41:00,500
rows, and you can group them, and
sort them. But once again, it

682
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,940
allows you to like do things
based on row's changing. And it

683
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,659
has a really, really nice API.
So, I, you know, I've used, I've

684
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:13,280
used it as kind of like a back
end for a lot of stuff. There's

685
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:17,000
a, a site that I built recently
like to allow parents to buy t-shirts

686
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,900
for their kids, and then
pay the invoices, and then I was

687
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,219
using the Airtable for that. Yeah,
there's [laughs] not really much of

688
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:28,460
[unintelligible]. It's very simple. A
lot of people use it. I think they're

689
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,650
like a- they're one of those
like, big billion dollar

690
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,280
companies.

691
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,340
Dan: So, if you were building
a service where you had to st-st-store

692
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:41,280
content, basically, in any way, at the beginning [crosstalk 00:41:37]
of it, it's, it's, it's the first thing you reach for? Yeah.

693
00:41:37 --> 00:41:39
Vic: Yeah. And then access-
doesn't need an API, right?

694
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,320
Bekah: Cool. Can we jump back to
indie hacking for a second?

695
00:41:47 --> 00:41:47
Vic: [whispers] Yes.

696
00:41:47 --> 00:41:51,840
Bekah: Coz I want to talk a little
bit about what the community is

697
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:57,000
like, and the kind of how you found
a place in that community?

698
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:01,650
Vic: Sure. So, I guess... it
probably starts when I,

699
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,590
like, started to follow various
people on Twitter. And I

700
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,920
realized that, "Oh, there is a
name for this thing." And like,

701
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,039
"Oh," it's like, "I shouldn't just
like, hide the things that I do."

702
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:13,800
Like, it's actually good to, you
know, like, share it in public,

703
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,590
right? Then I found indiehackers.com,
which is probably

704
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,960
one of the largest of these... and
I'm in a few other communities

705
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,019
like that. They're all like
Slack communities. Let's see...

706
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:28,289
Wait. [laughs] What was the rest
of your question?

707
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,869
Bekah: It's just kind of like
how you found your

708
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:33,690
place in the community, or like,
what the community is like?

709
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,949
Vic: It's... I find it to be like,
very welcoming

710
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:42,210
honestly. It's... there, there are,
of course, a lot of very, very

711
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:46,110
successful people in these
communities. And you gotta, you

712
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,630
gotta make sure that you follow
people that are, you know,

713
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:52,769
slightly out of yours- slightly
below you, as opposed to just

714
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:56,400
the people that are like wildly
successful, because then you

715
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,150
kind of experience this like
survivorship bias when you

716
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:04,230
follow people that are just, you know,
making, you know, tons of money or

717
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,719
have very, very successful
products, and you don't really

718
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,690
learn anything from them,
because, I don't know. They've

719
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:14,369
they've kind of, you know,
they're, they, they paint a much

720
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:17,969
rosier picture of their success
than, than perhaps what is like

721
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:23,070
real [chuckles]. So, I find that
it's important to follow people in

722
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:26,190
these communities... like Twitter
is probably honestly the best

723
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:30,090
place for this. You know, find
someone that has like, under

724
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:33,329
1000 followers, under 2000
followers, and is like dai- you

725
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:36,000
know, posting daily about their,
you know, what it is they're

726
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,250
building, and a lot of them
share their learnings like

727
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,690
successes and failures, and you
learn so much about it. And, and

728
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:49,139
I get so much value from reading
about people's failures. And

729
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:52,949
knowing you know, you know, I
should not do that. And

730
00:43:52,949 --> 00:43:57,389
similarly, when I find people
that are maybe, like, still just

731
00:43:57,389 --> 00:44:00,150
starting with it, and I'm able
to share like my successes and

732
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:03,869
failures with them, I really
enjoy doing that. So, I'm in the

733
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:06,599
Slack community called MicroB2C,
where it's a bunch of

734
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:14,369
people that build micro business
to consumer products. So, let's

735
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:16,619
see. So, they like... you know,
Lunch Money as an example there,

736
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:21,179
like, GG app is another example.
There's lots of

737
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:25,710
different ones there. And it's
just, it's just great to, like...

738
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:28,800
it's great to be able to post
questions to them for example,

739
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,800
like, "Oh, the Apple store has
changed some policy," like, you

740
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,650
know, and they say, "Oh, you need
to write your terms of service

741
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:37,980
to be like this." And you know, it
saves you from [chuckles] going through

742
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,849
the hassle of discovering all
this stuff on your own. It's-

743
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,030
they're good places. They're
also some paid communities. I'm

744
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:48,780
not really a part of any of the
paid indie communities.

745
00:44:49,289 --> 00:44:52,260
Bekah: Yeah, I love this idea
of learning

746
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:57,719
through failures because I know
we grow so much, but also, it

747
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:05,159
helps with our time saving superpowers
[chuckles], right? Like you [chuckles] get

748
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:09,719
to, I don't know, you get this
knowledge and understanding that

749
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:14,280
you might not get in any other
place, right? And so, some of my

750
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:19,019
favorite conversations recently
have been from people who have

751
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:21,510
been there before and can share
those. That's one of my first

752
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,239
questions like, "Okay, can you
talk about like your failure

753
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:27,869
and, and failures and what
you've learned?" Because then,

754
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:31,409
you know, like, I'm a step ahead
of where I was before. And I

755
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:34,530
don't have to go through that,
like, really painful process.

756
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:39,480
Vic: Exactly, right? So, I, I
love those people who

757
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:43,230
share immediately, like, very
forthcoming with you about what

758
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,260
they failed it. That, that's just
like such good vulnerability,

759
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,050
and they don't want you to go
through like, the stuff that

760
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:52,619
they've gone through. And I'm not a
fan of [chuckles] the people that are

761
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:57,300
like, "Oh, you'll find out." No, I
don't want to [laughs]. I want you to

762
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,739
tell me. I want... like... and so,
I bias a little bit toward the

763
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:03,150
oversharing and failures.

764
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:09,000
Dan: One, one of the, one of the
things that you said, sort of in

765
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,869
the same realm of-of following
people that are on your-

766
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:17,610
basically, on your level of, of learning
in indie hacking, I've- I think

767
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,690
is really good advice for anything,
for anything-

768
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,480
Vic: I mean, that's not to say
you shouldn't follow wildly

769
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22
successful people, right?

770
00:46:22 --> 00:46:22
Dan: Right, right.

771
00:46:22 --> 00:46:27
Vic: You just have to take their
learnings with a mountain of salt.

772
00:46:27 --> 00:46:27
Dan: Yes.

773
00:46:27 --> 00:46:31,619
Vic: And, and like, I don't know, maybe aspire
for their success, but not necessarily their

774
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:33,780
journey because everyone's
journey is completely different.

775
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:39,389
Dan: Oh, absolutely. I, I was, I
was going to say, it... I feel like

776
00:46:39,389 --> 00:46:42,869
it's very good advice. Just... I
don't... learning anything really,

777
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:46,019
or... not just indie hacking, right?
I mean, I, I would give the, the

778
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:49,170
same advice to developers. I
don't think I, I had framed it that

779
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,829
quite the way you did. It... but it
made me, it made me think that I

780
00:46:52,829 --> 00:46:56,130
should start framing it [chuckles] that
way, right? Because when people,

781
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:59,010
when people are in a different
phase, their perspective is

782
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:01,949
different even, you know? So, if
somebody is, i-is not just that

783
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:04,440
they have forgotten about the
failures along the way, and they

784
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,840
happen to have a successful
product, you know, but they're...

785
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:08,730
the things they're thinking
about are different if they're

786
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:12,809
managing a successful product,
versus trying to learn how to,

787
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:16,710
you know, trying to, trying to learn
at the beginning. It's just something

788
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:20,130
I've been wo-working on a-a-a lot with
Virtual Coffee, you know? A-and

789
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:25,110
one of the things I've enjoyed
the most is... becoming close with

790
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:28,769
people, you know, at different,
at different phases of, of the

791
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,739
developer journey, their career
journey, like, you know,

792
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:35,610
everything. And... I don't know. I, I just
think it's such good advice, you know.

793
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:38,130
I-it's don't... just don't always pay
attention to the people with the

794
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:40,619
million followers, you know, in,
in whatever.

795
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,460
Vic: Yeah. I mean, they probably
have valuable things to

796
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,300
say. It's just that not all of
it is going to work out for you.

797
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:49,780
But the person that is like,
closest to you has actionable

798
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:53,320
advice right now that, you know,
that is applicable and timely.

799
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,190
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

800
00:47:54,628 --> 00:47:56,309
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. We talked
about that in my

801
00:47:56,309 --> 00:48:01,469
breakout room today in Virtual
Coffee, this idea of processes

802
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:05,849
and growth and how so many times
you might have a blind spot,

803
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:09,239
especially like, you know, if, if
you haven't been there recently.

804
00:48:09,568 --> 00:48:13,168
And so, you know, being able to
fill in those blind spots are

805
00:48:13,168 --> 00:48:17,369
probably the person who is
closer to the problem or your

806
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:22,259
stage in the journey. And...
that's incredibly valuable.

807
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,329
Vic: Totally agree.

808
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,590
Dan: I mean, I could talk about
this, the low-code, the services

809
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,170
stuff for hours. I... it's...
this is just one of those-

810
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,039
Vic: What services?

811
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:33
Dan: The, the low-code services.

812
00:48:34 --> 00:48:34
Vic: Oh, yeah.

813
00:48:33 --> 00:48:44,219
Dan: A-airtable and Zapier, and just like the way different ways to hack-
like hook all this stuff together. Are there any other notable low-code

814
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:48,989
services that you like to use
besides we have mentioned so far

815
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:51,630
Caard and Airtable and Zapier?
Are there any, any other

816
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:52,739
interesting or cool ones that
you like, like to use?

817
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:55,409
Vic: I think I probably use
those more than

818
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:04,110
anything else. Trying to think. But... I mean
[silence] let's see... No, I think the... I

819
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:07,739
think those form a bulk of my,
like- I think I can build

820
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,659
anything with like, just those
three things. I mean, plus, you

821
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:15,329
know, I, I don't just use that,
there, there are people that use

822
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:17,579
like, you know, something like,
I think it's called Bubble or

823
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:20,909
any of those other like, things
that let you like, build a whole

824
00:49:20,909 --> 00:49:24,420
app with just like, you know, in
no-code local stuff, but I

825
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,900
actually have them as part of my
React app. So, although like, you

826
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,380
know, a NextJS page that just
happens to use, you know, Airtable

827
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:35,099
as a, as a thing. And I actually
have a- I have a lightning

828
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:42,539
talk on, you know, building a, a, an,
an Airtable backed app next month at

829
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:44,039
the Virtual Coffee.

830
00:49:44 --> 00:49:45
Dan: Yeah. I'm looking-

831
00:49:44,068 --> 00:49:47,128
Bekah: Oh. This will probably drop
[crosstalk 00:49:46] in February- on

832
00:49:47,128 --> 00:49:48,298
February 26th.

833
00:49:46 - 00:49:46
Vic: I'm, I'm looking-

834
00:49:49,139 --> 00:49:53,519
Dan: [chuckles] Yeah [crosstalk 00:49:48].
I'm looking forward to that talk.

835
00:49:48 --> 00:49:49
Vic: I'm looking forward to it.

836
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:58,110
Dan: And learning more about how you
like, hook up next... you know, that

837
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:01,530
side of it as well. Again, I could
talk about this stuff for [chuckles],

838
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:02,699
for hours.

839
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,940
Bekah: So, we talked about
having community

840
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,780
members around your space and
the journey that you can learn

841
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:18,179
from too. And so, I'm curious to, you
know, how close to your projects

842
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:21,300
are they, in terms of the things
that they're making? Like, so, are

843
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,750
you just mainly focusing on
people who are doing things

844
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:28,500
similar to you? Or, you know,
how do you kind of learn from

845
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,000
the people around you?

846
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:33,719
Vic: Oh, you mean, like, the, the
specific niche I'm in?

847
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,500
Nich? Niche? I don't know.

848
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:36,929
Bekah: Yeah, I know. I say it
both ways too.

849
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,030
Vic: They're kind of all over
the place actually. I

850
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,960
follow several people that are
like, making candles, you know?

851
00:50:43,019 --> 00:50:46,079
Or- but like, you learn
something from that too, right?

852
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,010
So, this person makes candles,
and you know, they happen to

853
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:53,400
use Caard and Shopify to put
together a site really quickly.

854
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,760
And, you know, it's, it's once
again example of like, shipping

855
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,980
quickly, right? And I don't
mean like, literally shipping

856
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,210
the candle. But like, actually
like the- I think the process

857
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:06,690
for a lot of bootstrap founders
is very similar. So, like in the

858
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:11,219
candle making example, you could
decide to build a whole business

859
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:14,369
and build, you know, build an
elaborate site, and then like,

860
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:19,710
you could release it and find
out that no one cares. Or you

861
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:24,420
could announce that, "Hi, I a small
business solo founder. I'm

862
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,090
thinking about-", you know, "-making
hand pouring candles." And it

863
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,670
turns out that 100 peop- and
then, you know, you launch a

864
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:36,179
little site on like Caard, or
Shopify or whatever, and 100

865
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:39,300
people have pre-sign up, and
it tells you that this, you

866
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,820
know, there's interest for this,
and that, you know, it's

867
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,969
something that you wanna do,
and this particular one, so,

868
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:49,380
Terra Simply is the candle
company I'm talking about. But

869
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,500
it's just like Shopify, and she
just pours candles, and, you

870
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,710
know, in her house in Missouri,
and it's like, really, really...

871
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,889
so, you know, I learned a ton of
stuff from this. Even though it

872
00:51:58,889 --> 00:52:02,280
has nothing to do with, with,
like, building software

873
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:08,460
products, right? And I follow
like, some people that, that

874
00:52:08,489 --> 00:52:11,610
like, you know, have other like,
direct to consumer stuff, like

875
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,820
printing t-shirts on demand, you
know? And I learned... you learn...

876
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,389
you never know what you're going
to learn when you start

877
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:22,289
following someone. And then you
do when you realize that, you

878
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:26,250
know, this is like something
that actually is really useful

879
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:30,000
to you. I mean, and I just learned...
I just like learning random

880
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,610
things. Like I'm super good at
triage [unintelligible]

881
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:36,570
your team. I just know
random factoids that I shove in

882
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,510
the back of my head for like, someday
when it's going [chuckles] to be

883
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:43,170
useful. And, and I find that
just falling like kind of this

884
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,590
diverse group of people, the
only thing in common between all

885
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:51,239
of them is that they are solo
founders, you know, is actually

886
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:54,329
really useful. I listened a bunch
of podcasts through where I learned

887
00:52:54,329 --> 00:52:55,260
a lot of stuff from.

888
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:59,889
Dan: That's a great point. And, and
just the diversity of... Si-si-since

889
00:52:59,889 --> 00:53:02,619
it's not all around a technology,
right? I-it's not...

890
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:06,219
you're, you're gonna have diverse
solutions and, and all the different

891
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:09,909
problems, you know? It's, that's
seems like a very cool community

892
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:10,599
to be a part of.

893
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,168
Vic: Yeah. And you're gonna
learn about, like,

894
00:53:13,168 --> 00:53:15,688
some tool that someone's using
that like, you'd never even

895
00:53:15,688 --> 00:53:19,469
thought of, you know, like, "Oh, wow.
That's gonna be useful for me and my

896
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:20,849
preschool thing," or whatever.

897
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:24,599
Bekah: Alright, Vic, I think
this is been a

898
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:29,309
fantastic conversation, and I am
so glad to- that you came here to

899
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:32,250
have this with us. Where can our
listeners find you?

900
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:37,639
Vic: You can find me on Twitter
at twitter.com slash

901
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:43,639
Vic, V-I-C, Vijayakumar,
V-I-J-A-Y-A-K-U-M-A-R. Or you

902
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:47,780
can find me on my site where I
blog about the most random

903
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:52,039
things. So, vicvijayakumar.com.
Once again, spelled the same

904
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:56,000
way. And, yeah. And I'm going to
be sending out my first

905
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:00
newsletter this [crosstalk 00:53:56]
month, I think.

906
00:53:56 --> 00:53:59
Bekah: Woohoo. [crosstalk 00:53:58]
I'm sign up for that too.

907
00:53:58 --> 00:54:00
Dan: Yeah. Yep.

908
00:54:00 --> 00:54:02,840
Vic: A bunch of people that have signed up.
I don't know what I'm going to write about

909
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,610
yet, but it's going to be
interesting.

910
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:06,940
Bekah: Listen, I will let you
know I sign up for

911
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,969
everything that Vic does, because
he's super awesome [chuckles]. So, I

912
00:54:09,969 --> 00:54:12
can't wait until [crosstalk 00:54:08]
Meet Sweats drops.

913
00:54:08 --> 00:54:10
Vic: [laughs] Thank you.

914
00:54:12 --> 00:54:17,920
Bekah: Because [crosstalk 00:54:13] I know it's gonna be life
changing. Doesn't matter. You made it. I'll be there [laughs].

915
00:54:13 --> 00:54:15
Vic: [laughs] Who knows
what it's gonna be about?

916
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:20,530
It's gonna be the Fire Fest [??]
of our day.

917
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:25,030
