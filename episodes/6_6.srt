00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:12,586
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and welcome to
Season 6, Episode 6 of the

2
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:17,426
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:17,426 --> 00:00:21,266
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:24,356
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:26,937
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:31,407
stories and what they've learned
here. And we are here to share it

7
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:36,402
with you. Here with like host
Dan.

8
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,637
Dan Ott: Hey, Bekah how's it going?

9
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:40,572
Bekah: fantastic.

10
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:46,256
Dan: Yes, we are in a silly
mood cuz we just finished

11
00:00:46,262 --> 00:00:51,057
recording with Julia Seidman,
developer, educator. She's

12
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:53,966
independent consultant and
she's had really long and

13
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:58,046
interesting career, couple
different roles. And it was a

14
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:00,447
really good time. It was a very
silly time as well. So, we,

15
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:02,906
we, we had a good time talking to
Julia as always.

16
00:01:03,307 --> 00:01:05,966
Bekah: Yeah, we did. We had a, a
deep dive into our intro

17
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:09,417
question. So I think that we have
set the record for longest ever

18
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:14,066
intro because we explored quite a
few tangents.

19
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:18,867
Dan: Yes. But we learned some
things along the way. Right?

20
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:23,277
Bekah: We did some very, very
interesting things about

21
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:27,716
exploring different technologies
as developer educator, and what

22
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:28,316
that career path.

23
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,066
Dan: mm-hmm

24
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:33,611
Bekah: Also about rhodium gotta,
you gotta listen the end of the

25
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:35,632
episode, though. If you wanna
know about rhodium.

26
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:41,516
Dan: yeah, no, Julia has a, a
really great, outlook on

27
00:01:41,576 --> 00:01:43,647
pretty much everything. You
know, she talks a lot about how

28
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:47,277
education is important in her
writing process. And, she has

29
00:01:47,277 --> 00:01:53,216
this, I don't know if it's a
ethos or whatever, but, she

30
00:01:53,216 --> 00:01:59,052
says "embrace the careen over the
career." Right. And I. As another

31
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,221
person who I never thought about
it like that. Exactly. But, I

32
00:02:02,227 --> 00:02:04,811
very much appreciate that that
look in life. I think it's

33
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:09,372
very healthy one too. So,
yeah, I don't know. It was, it

34
00:02:09,377 --> 00:02:12,877
was a good time and it was fun.
So I, this is I'm horrible at

35
00:02:12,877 --> 00:02:15,098
ending things. It hasn't gotten
better.

36
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:20,212
Bekah: I think that's probably
my, my job to pick up with. We

37
00:02:20,212 --> 00:02:23,272
start every episode of the
podcast. Like we start every

38
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:26,122
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name where

39
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:31,673
we're from. What we do and a
random check-in question, and we

40
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:44,288
hope that you enjoy this episode.
Our intro question today is if

41
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:49,268
you could have an unlimited
supply of one non-food thing for

42
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:56,198
the rest of your life, what would
it be? My name is Bekah. I am a

43
00:02:56,198 --> 00:03:07,027
technical community builder at a
it's not what I normally say. I

44
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:08,587
don't know. Hi I'm Bekah

45
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:10,957
Dan: It sounded good.

46
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:15,247
Bekah: but it was like, I don't,
that's just not what I normally

47
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:17,918
say. And then my brain was like,
what are you doing? This is not

48
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:20,807
how we do this thing.
Alright,

49
00:03:20,918 --> 00:03:23,048
Dan: That's what my brain does
every time, except that there's

50
00:03:23,048 --> 00:03:24,247
not a normal thing that it's

51
00:03:24,277 --> 00:03:26,798
Bekah: Well that's because you
don't know what you do. you're

52
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:28,358
very confused about.

53
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:32,467
Julia Seidman: Same same.

54
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:36,277
Bekah: Hi, I'm Bekah, I'm a
technical community builder at

55
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:41,078
DeepGram from a small town in
Ohio and an unlimited supply of

56
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:49,837
one nod food thing for the rest
of my life. I, this is just,

57
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:53,737
I don't know where to go with
this. I really like N

58
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:59,707
notebooks and pens, but that's
two things. So that should it be

59
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:03,397
like practical and does it just
automatically appear because

60
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:07,298
like, I, for a long time kept
forgetting to buy light bulbs.

61
00:04:07,302 --> 00:04:10,927
And so we were in the dark all
the time, so, or like triple a

62
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:13,358
batteries. I don't, I'm just,

63
00:04:13,432 --> 00:04:13,832
Julia: good one.

64
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:16,867
Bekah: and non food items. All I

65
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:17,392
Julia: always have

66
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:17,858
Bekah: food

67
00:04:18,622 --> 00:04:20,833
Julia: always have double A,
never have triple As..

68
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:24,007
Bekah: Yeah, exactly. Or like
that one time you need a D

69
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:28,701
battery and like what the, no, I
don't have a D battery. So I

70
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:28,940
don't,

71
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:30,995
Julia: You wanna show your kid
what happens when you look a nine

72
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:34,076
volt and you don't have a mind.

73
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:35,990
Bekah: Am I supposed to show kid
that

74
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:39,576
Julia: I feel like it's a right
of passage

75
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:42,321
Bekah: I don't even understand
what that I've never heard of.

76
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:42,800
That

77
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:44,495
Dan: go try it. See what happens.

78
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,891
Bekah: I don't have a nine volt

79
00:04:50,886 --> 00:04:51,235
Dan: no,

80
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:57,156
Julia: was a science teacher. a
lot questionable things.

81
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,071
Bekah: dry ice is really fun. You
can do. My dad was a pharmacist.

82
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:04,281
I remember like sometimes he
would bring home dry ice. I like

83
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,071
something shipped in it. I'm
like, this is the coolest thing

84
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:09,891
ever. I'll just go with dry ice.
I'm gonna have an unlimited

85
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:14,060
supply of dry ice. I'm that's
what I'm

86
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:20,315
Dan: Alright, well, you'll
have lots of, well steam or,

87
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:22,206
well, that's not really steam, is
it? It's?

88
00:05:22,286 --> 00:05:25,805
Julia: It, the, the chemical
process is called sublimation.

89
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:28,475
Dan: Yeah, but what is the thing
called? The

90
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:31,026
Julia: it's steam. It's when a
solid

91
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:36,755
Dan: Okay. It is team. Okay.
Yeah. All right. Cool. Hi, I

92
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:43,896
am Dan. I do stuff. I I am a
independent, computer person,

93
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:50,315
developer guy. Yeah, if I'm
Cleveland and, yeah, I think,

94
00:05:50,346 --> 00:05:52,625
time is what I'm going with.
That would be the thing that

95
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:54,005
Bekah: Oh, that's not fair.
That's

96
00:05:56,675 --> 00:05:59,946
Dan: Listen, it's not food.
That's only, that was the only

97
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:02,706
rule. All right, fine. Uh

98
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:04,855
Julia: time is infinite. Dan,

99
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:10,326
Dan: Hmm. But I don't have an
infant supply of it. See,

100
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:14,185
Bekah: you want free time. That's
what you're asking for.

101
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:16,115
Dan: I want more time.

102
00:06:16,716 --> 00:06:17,776
Julia: you wanna look forever?

103
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:23,555
Dan: No, no, that doesn't
either. Yeah, no, no, no.

104
00:06:23,586 --> 00:06:28,956
alright fine. How about, can
I sell the thing? it,

105
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:29,521
Julia: Sure.

106
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:31,776
Dan: can I do, I mean,

107
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,380
Bekah: No drugs. sell

108
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:37,536
Dan: Can I do money? Nothing
illegal. What is this? You're

109
00:06:37,536 --> 00:06:45,125
putting all these rules in didn't
exist. Gold. One of those

110
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:53,286
things called. Doubloons. Yep.
That's it. like a pirate and then

111
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:56,915
I'll sell 'em when I need more
money and, infinite supply.

112
00:06:58,656 --> 00:07:06,786
Yeah. It's the most practical way
to transport gold. Yeah. And,

113
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:09,516
you know, I could fill up a pool
and go swimming in it.

114
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:13,326
Scrooge McDuck style. I could
sell them, you know, when I

115
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:18,846
needed more money for things, I
could probably make jewelry out

116
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:23,225
of them. Doubloons, you know,
is, you know,

117
00:07:23,255 --> 00:07:27,995
Bekah: Just for reference. We are
recording this a Thursday Eastern

118
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,336
in afternoon. We are not even
like,

119
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:31,625
Julia: No, one's

120
00:07:34,776 --> 00:07:38,105
Dan: I, I went home for lunch
just before this and, opened

121
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:41,511
my fridge to get a soda.
Definitely took a hard look at

122
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:46,190
the beer I chose not to today,
but, I, I, I was like, it's

123
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,031
been that kind of week. I, I, I
took a look at it. So I

124
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:53,120
decided to but I actually got my
first, like full night sleep last

125
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,951
night in, I don't know, at least
a

126
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:56,975
Bekah: oh, your brain doesn't
know what to do with itself.

127
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:00,411
Dan: I know, I know have lots of
energy today, so anyway, me and

128
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:04,581
my gold doubloons, are gonna, you
know, what we're gonna do.

129
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:06,466
Bekah: Good luck, Julia. It's.

130
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:11,886
Julia: Yeah, I have a lot of
thoughts now. My name's Julia

131
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:20,555
side, I am, I don't know. I
guess I call my lately. I've been

132
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:26,235
calling myself a developer
educator. I'm kind of mainly

133
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:34,505
what I do is I work with API
companies to create sample apps

134
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:38,495
and getting started guides and
tutorials, and generally help

135
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,225
them like improve their developer
experience, with specifically

136
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:46,775
like with an eye towards
onboarding new developers, but

137
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:50,375
also like trying to create
content that inspires.

138
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:59,750
Creativity. So I write code,
and I write about code and

139
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:08,571
yeah. I, if I had an
unlimited supply of something, so

140
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,791
I was gonna say sunscreen because
I compulsively buy sunscreen,

141
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:21,321
like in enormous quantities.
Every time I see it, I'm like,

142
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,610
oh, I should probably buy more
sunscreen. But I don't ever

143
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:31,250
actually remember to use it. And
I'm imagining that if I had an

144
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,600
unlimited supply that just like
materialized, then maybe I would

145
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:38,841
actually remember to use the
sunblock and I would stop

146
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:44,030
spending so much money on
sunblock that doesn't get used.

147
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:53,405
But then I thought. There are
rare earth metals that are much

148
00:09:53,405 --> 00:10:02,285
more valuable per ounce gold. And
if I'm allowed sell the thing and

149
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:05,796
especially if I could like have
rare earth metals without the

150
00:10:05,796 --> 00:10:09,605
environmental costs of mining
them and like the like child

151
00:10:09,605 --> 00:10:13,956
labor costs of mining them and
all of that, then, then that's

152
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:18,216
that that'd be really good. So I
think I'm not sure which rare

153
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:23,735
earth metal I have to do my
research. But yeah, that's

154
00:10:23,735 --> 00:10:25,655
what I'm thinking.

155
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:30,980
Dan: of another answer,
energy. That'd be my, that was my

156
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,520
one. Yeah. Cause I could sell
that too honestly. But I

157
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,990
could also, you know power, all

158
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:36,696
Bekah: I was

159
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,541
Dan: all BA my battery things

160
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:39,966
Bekah: get the day. You're

161
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:42,260
Dan: oh, personal energy. Oh no,
no, no. I meant like,

162
00:10:42,346 --> 00:10:42,956
Bekah: energy.

163
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,461
Dan: you, yeah, well, you know,
not doesn't have to be

164
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:48,711
electricity, just energy, you
know, I can convert it into

165
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:52,821
electricity if I want, I can
convert it into, probably

166
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:53,331
other things,

167
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:54,216
Bekah: it make you fast?

168
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,931
Dan: Well, no, probably could
power a thing that fast. You

169
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:05,571
know, you know, so yeah,
that's, that's it that's gotta be

170
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:10,490
the real answer. I, I, do wanna
know where these things come

171
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,941
from, you know, cuz because
it's like unlimited supply,

172
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:14,916
Bekah: unlimited

173
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,941
Dan: well is it not, is it
unlimited supply? I mean, yeah.

174
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:23,270
Does it mean like you were asking
about this too? Does it just like

175
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,551
one appear when you need it? Or
is it like

176
00:11:26,326 --> 00:11:26,816
Julia: Yeah.

177
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,721
Dan: I mean it's a, know, it has
be like that.

178
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:32,936
Bekah: Yeah. That's what I was
imagining a closet of

179
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:36,591
Dan: Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So they
don't yes. Nobody's mining them

180
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,750
or, or, or making this unblock or
whatever

181
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:39,265
Julia: Yeah.

182
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:39,650
Dan: yeah,

183
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:43,385
Julia: As far as I know,
manufacturing, sunblock is not

184
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:43,806
like

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,931
Dan: We need Kirk on this.

186
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:47,105
Julia: environmentally costly,
but.

187
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:47,990
Dan: I

188
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:50,225
Bekah: that should be our last
episode of the season should just

189
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:51,936
be Kirk questions that we answer.

190
00:11:55,221 --> 00:11:57,561
Dan: Oh man, Kirk, if he was
there for that would just have an

191
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,010
aneurysm, I think by the end of
it.

192
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,500
Bekah: So, if you are
listening and you have not

193
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,711
experienced a Kirk question, when
we do these questions before

194
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:11,120
every Virtual Coffee, Kirk has
been coming up with some,

195
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:16,791
some doozies, I, I guess you can
label them where it, leaves a

196
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:21,500
lot of room for interpretation
and requires you to think outside

197
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,390
of the box, which is a rabbit
hole for most of us.

198
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:33,546
Julia: Yeah. I hold a little
bit of blame potentially. I don't

199
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:37,115
know. In that one time in the
co-working room, I pulled out a

200
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:42,275
copy of, would you rather
questions year olds? And

201
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:45,306
there have been a few that were
inspired by would you rather for

202
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,235
eight year olds,

203
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,500
Bekah: Is that a book?

204
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:49,625
Julia: it's a book.

205
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,841
Bekah: Oh, oh,

206
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:51,350
Dan: Mmm,

207
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:55,985
Julia: have them for seven year
olds, eight year olds, nine year

208
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:59,706
olds. I don't what the difference
is, but

209
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:01,130
Dan: right. I'm writing that
down.

210
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,245
Bekah: kid has a birthday in a
couple weeks. He's about to be

211
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:07,535
eight and he would love that. So
guess don't, this will come out

212
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:15,995
after his birthday. So in case he
listens, it will not spoiled.

213
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:20,975
I think this is the record for
our longest intro ever.

214
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:22,446
Julia: sorry.

215
00:13:23,196 --> 00:13:26,316
Bekah: no, don't be sorry. It was
all Dan's fault.

216
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,260
Dan: no.

217
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,931
Julia: I even held back on a
about gold doubloons,

218
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:33,846
Bekah: you have a

219
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:34,740
Dan: now I,

220
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,640
Julia: not actually about gold
doubloons, it's about gold

221
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,941
krugerrands, which, so it was the
currency in South Africa. Like,

222
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:49,250
I don't know, historically,
I'm not sure when they stopped

223
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:55,941
using them, but they are, I guess
they, they were kind of popular

224
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:02,030
among like people doing like
black market kind of stuff,

225
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:10,880
pre-internet age. And we had
a super corrupt governor in

226
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,801
Connecticut when I was growing up
named John Roland. And, one

227
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:21,321
of John Roland had like a couple
of cronies in my hometown and,

228
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:29,721
one of his. I don't know,
partners in crime was the father

229
00:14:29,721 --> 00:14:38,480
of one of my sister's classmates.
And, he, he was arrested

230
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:46,221
while my sister was in high
school. And I, in my mind,

231
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:51,331
they actually caught him in the
act of burying gold krugerrands

232
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,740
in his backyard. I don't know
that they actually caught him in

233
00:14:54,745 --> 00:14:58,971
the act, but for sure, my sister
went to high school with someone

234
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,921
who was, whose father was
arrested and found to have

235
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,990
hundreds of thousands of dollars
of like illegal south African

236
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,510
gold coins buried in his
backyard. So

237
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:19,326
Dan: that is incredible. that.
This is about. It's so much of a

238
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:21,725
better story than if you just had
like cash buried in his

239
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:24,995
Julia: Oh, totally. Well, there
was that guy from Louisiana who

240
00:15:24,995 --> 00:15:29,015
had cash in his freezer. This
guy, way more

241
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:33,395
Dan: One and a half Yeah. They're
like this quarter, like a little

242
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:35,375
bit bigger than an American
quarter, I suppose.

243
00:15:35,706 --> 00:15:36,515
Julia: Are you looking it up?

244
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:40,115
Dan: I'm looking at 'em on
Wikipedia. So by, 1980, they

245
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:43,895
accounted for more than 90% of
the global coin market. And was

246
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:45,846
the number one choice for
investors buying gold.

247
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:47,885
Julia: yeah,

248
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:51,015
Dan: you go. they're not though

249
00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:52,956
Julia: you know,

250
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,015
Bekah: This is where we need
sound effects for like the more,

251
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:58,025
you know, is that, how it goes?

252
00:16:00,816 --> 00:16:01,416
Dan: Um,

253
00:16:02,946 --> 00:16:03,125
Bekah: We

254
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:04,596
Dan: I don't have that one. All I
have is

255
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:06,336
Bekah: that is

256
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:07,206
Dan: that's all,

257
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:11,466
Bekah: not, not what we're not
the I was going for.

258
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,956
Dan: so these are cool, but
yeah, doubloons, I feel like I

259
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:19,056
need them to be bigger and
thicker, you know,

260
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:19,806
Bekah: So you

261
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,096
Dan: mean? Why you could wear 'em
you could do, you know, you what

262
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,125
I.

263
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:27,649
Julia: Like they're a lot more
portable than like a big brick

264
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:30,673
Dan: Oh, I get it. I mean, I
understand practically, like

265
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:32,474
these are good for crime and
stuff, you know,

266
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:33,729
Bekah: These are good for.

267
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:38,083
Dan: for my thing, you know, this
is why I want, if I have an

268
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,083
unlimited supply, I'd rather
just, you know, know what I mean?

269
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:44,443
If I change my mind later, I can
just melt 'em down and make

270
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:51,193
Krugerrands with them. Well, that
was our.

271
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:55,168
Julia: think.

272
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:00,389
Bekah: I'm gonna, there's no
segue here. So thanks for coming

273
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:05,249
on the podcast, Julia, we like to
get started with your origin

274
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:08,969
story and maybe that's where it
starts with gold coins and

275
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:15,058
backyards. But give us your,
your story of how you came to

276
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:16,078
this point in your tech.

277
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:24,959
Julia: Only. So I, I,
when I was in college, I,

278
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:31,679
well, so when I was in college,
I double majored in

279
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:38,009
anthropology and comparative
religion, which is not useful

280
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:44,638
in any commonly known sense of
the word. But I had a, I had

281
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:50,729
a, a Dean who I knew pre she
was actually, well anyway, I knew

282
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:52,648
her pretty well, and we were
talking one time and she said

283
00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:56,999
something about how she had had a
cur, she had decided to embrace

284
00:17:57,003 --> 00:18:04,108
the Korean over the career. And I
just really liked that phrase and

285
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:10,814
idea, like, and, and I would say
that. That's kind of what I

286
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:17,773
aspire to is like, I, I can't
plan. I'm no good at committing

287
00:18:17,923 --> 00:18:24,344
to any like long term vision, but
what I am good at is rolling with

288
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:29,834
the punches and like just kind of
seeing where things go. So,

289
00:18:31,423 --> 00:18:37,153
after college, I bounced around
for a few years, working in as a

290
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:44,223
professional fundraiser as,
an events coordinator really

291
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:53,653
briefly as a recruiter. And
then, I spent like about four

292
00:18:53,653 --> 00:18:58,544
years working in finance,
which was just a total, like, I

293
00:18:58,544 --> 00:19:02,084
just stumbled into the job. They
had hired somebody else who went

294
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:06,794
to the same college and they were
like, Ugh, Let's hire her. Let's

295
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:15,284
see how it goes. And, I, so I
really liked it in some ways.

296
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:21,013
really liked that the sort of the
analytical work. I liked that I

297
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:27,044
was learning a lot because I had
no background in finance. I

298
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:33,884
did a lot of writing while I was
there. And if I kind of look back

299
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:39,763
at like, what's the theme, in my,
in my Korean, what I would say is

300
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:45,554
that I, what I, what I do over
the long arc, I learn about

301
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:50,173
things. And then I write about
them. So at that phase, I was

302
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:52,513
learning about finance and
writing about finance

303
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:58,364
simultaneously. And that was
great for a few years. But

304
00:19:58,368 --> 00:20:06,733
then in 2000, Fall of 2008,
winter of 2009. I don't remember.

305
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:11,054
I, I don't know if other people
remember this time as acutely as

306
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:16,963
I do. I live in Seattle, WAMU
collapsed. I worked in finance,

307
00:20:16,993 --> 00:20:23,473
everything else collapsed. We had
people being taken to the ER in

308
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,453
the middle of the work day
because they thought they were

309
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:29,443
having heart attacks, but it was
actually just panic attacks.

310
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:33,733
It was such an intensely
stressful time that I was like,

311
00:20:34,423 --> 00:20:39,284
peace. I am, I am out here. I do
not wanna work in this world

312
00:20:39,284 --> 00:20:46,634
anymore. No one is happy. And
so I did, I went back to school

313
00:20:46,634 --> 00:20:51,193
and did something that was
probably as far in the opposite

314
00:20:51,193 --> 00:20:54,253
direction as you could go. And I
became a high school English

315
00:20:54,253 --> 00:21:06,673
teacher. I did that for.
About 10 years. And then just

316
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:15,374
kind of got exhausted by the, I
don't know, the vagaries of

317
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:22,124
working in public education.
and it's another story for

318
00:21:22,124 --> 00:21:27,673
another day, but I worked at a
very high pressure in a very high

319
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:34,933
income, high pressure community.
And, I was really not happy

320
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:41,763
with like the way that my
students lives were being shaped.

321
00:21:42,673 --> 00:21:50,054
So when my second child was
born, I was like, you know, I'm

322
00:21:50,054 --> 00:21:52,963
gonna take a break and I took a
year off and it felt really good.

323
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:57,104
And so I took another year off.
And during that second year, I

324
00:21:57,104 --> 00:22:02,804
started learning how to code.
I started kind of more with data

325
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:08,953
science because of having that
finance background. But along

326
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:13,034
the way, kind of stumbled my way
through various things. And I did

327
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:16,814
a bootcamp. I did some
self-taught stuff. I did some

328
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:26,953
internships. I did a, an kind
of a incubator program. And

329
00:22:26,953 --> 00:22:32,233
then stumbled my way once again,
into this role that I'm in now,

330
00:22:32,624 --> 00:22:38,263
doing developer education. So
once again, I'm learning about

331
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:43,243
things and then I'm writing about
them. So yeah, that's, that's

332
00:22:43,243 --> 00:22:48,568
my origin story. And I think it's
good because I finally found

333
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:51,628
something where like, there's
really no limit on how much I can

334
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:59,398
learn. and I have a ton of
control over who I work with and

335
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:04,709
when I work and all of that, and
the people that I am teaching

336
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:09,419
through my work really wanna
learn they are intrinsically

337
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:15,269
motivated and that's that's cool.
Yeah, so that's me.

338
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,479
Bekah: that makes such a
difference when people are

339
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:20,519
motivated to learn.

340
00:23:21,838 --> 00:23:28,288
Julia: it's huge. And like you
get that sometimes in K-12

341
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:32,818
education, right? Like I'm, I
don't know. I'm sure we all had

342
00:23:32,824 --> 00:23:38,489
times in our education where we
were really genuinely motivated

343
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:45,659
by something, but there's just so
much else going on that. I don't

344
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,398
know. don't love it.

345
00:23:48,148 --> 00:23:50,819
Bekah: Right, Right, That's I
mean, my background's in

346
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:54,959
education. I taught college
English for 10 years and it was a

347
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:59,669
lot of core classes, which means
people had to take those classes.

348
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:02,878
It an option. Most of them did
not wanna be there. Didn't see

349
00:24:02,884 --> 00:24:06,209
the point of it. Weren't
motivated. And like, to the point

350
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:11,999
of being aggressively unmotivated
and like about things, I'm like,

351
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:17,923
this is not. why I signed up to
and like the rare occasion, I

352
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:22,153
would be able to teach,
like a special interest class. I

353
00:24:22,153 --> 00:24:25,874
taught a screenwriting class once
I had eight or 10 students. It

354
00:24:25,874 --> 00:24:29,023
was the best experience. I loved
that because everybody was

355
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:32,953
excited about being there and
talking about those things.

356
00:24:33,074 --> 00:24:37,273
but those experiences are not as
frequent

357
00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:44,909
Julia: no, no. They're not. Yeah.
And it, I mean, the people who

358
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,798
stick with it and do it for a
long time and I mean, I have

359
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:58,709
enormous respect, but, I also
don't at all, judge, anyone who

360
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:02,368
opts out because it can be pretty
demoralizing.

361
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:06,973
Bekah: Yeah. And I think that, I
don't know if it's a generational

362
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:10,094
thing or not, but I know my
parents stayed in careers

363
00:25:10,098 --> 00:25:16,094
forever. And a lot of the people
around us, who are in the

364
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:19,453
same generation, they spent their
entire careers, you know, doing

365
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:24,433
one thing. But I see more people
now maybe just cuz I'm older

366
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:30,374
changing careers and, not having
to be stuck doing something that

367
00:25:30,374 --> 00:25:35,384
you're not interested in doing is
really important to me. So I know

368
00:25:35,384 --> 00:25:38,233
like I would talk to somebody
else about a career in tech and I

369
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:41,203
was like, I don't know if I'll be
here five years or not. She she's

370
00:25:41,203 --> 00:25:43,334
the same thing. Like, yeah. I
don't know if I will either. I

371
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:47,834
kind of hope I'm not like there
are lots of options out there in

372
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:52,574
finding, exploring those things
that keep you interested, I think

373
00:25:52,578 --> 00:25:55,933
helps you to, I dunno, be
motivated in all areas of your

374
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:56,203
life.

375
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,638
Julia: Mm-hmm Yeah. And that's
something like when I kind of

376
00:25:59,638 --> 00:26:04,499
made the transition into tech, I
was pretty explicit in saying

377
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:09,328
like, it's not that I think I'm
gonna be writing code all day

378
00:26:09,328 --> 00:26:16,269
every day for the rest of my
life. This is a skill, a.

379
00:26:18,403 --> 00:26:24,584
It's a skill and like a
discipline that can feed other

380
00:26:24,673 --> 00:26:30,943
kinds of growth that can enable
me to get involved in, in

381
00:26:30,943 --> 00:26:35,203
different things. And I, I think
initially I thought of it more as

382
00:26:35,203 --> 00:26:38,864
a skill. And now I would say it's
really is more of like a

383
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:46,993
discipline. Like there's not one
skill that, that anybody learns

384
00:26:47,354 --> 00:26:54,163
except maybe. And, and I think
that this is part of like, what

385
00:26:54,163 --> 00:26:59,534
has helped make me successful in
the time that I've been working

386
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:05,324
in tech? Maybe the skill is
just learning how to learn.

387
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:10,963
Like, and I think that that's
like, if I of what I'm good at,

388
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:14,324
like I'm good at learning about
stuff and that's, I think

389
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:18,689
probably the most essential.
Skill, otherwise, like, it's not

390
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:21,929
like you could say like, oh, I
have a skill in writing

391
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:27,719
JavaScript. Like that's not, I
mean, there is skill, but it

392
00:27:27,723 --> 00:27:34,019
changes. And really the skill is
a, is about like habits of mind.

393
00:27:34,023 --> 00:27:37,739
And, I don't know.

394
00:27:40,574 --> 00:27:44,503
Bekah: I love that. And I think
I, I also always struggle with

395
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:47,953
people asking me what my career
goals are. And I think that's for

396
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:51,163
like a lot of this reason, I
don't really have career goals.

397
00:27:51,163 --> 00:27:54,403
Like I'm interested in, you know,
connecting other people. And like

398
00:27:54,403 --> 00:27:57,824
you said, like learning new
things. And so for me, it's not

399
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:01,814
like, oh, I wanna be a senior
blah, blah, blah, someday. You

400
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:05,683
know, I just wanna keep doing
things that I'm interested in and

401
00:28:05,713 --> 00:28:10,483
helping to support other people,
you know, feel part of something.

402
00:28:10,729 --> 00:28:15,929
Julia: mm-hmm I mean, I think
it's cool when people. Have those

403
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:17,368
aspirations to,

404
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:21,733
Bekah: Yeah. I think that's
totally fine. I just think that

405
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:25,723
there are so many different
career paths and ways to approach

406
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:29,804
what you're doing. That like,
acknowledging that I'm interested

407
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:33,284
in learning or learning new
things. Now that's a really great

408
00:28:33,284 --> 00:28:33,824
place to be.

409
00:28:34,598 --> 00:28:36,088
Julia: mm-hmm ,mm-hmm

410
00:28:37,108 --> 00:28:40,318
Bekah: So let's back up a little
bit and talk about what your

411
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:42,689
work, what you do for work.

412
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:43,479
Julia: sure.

413
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:50,548
Bekah: to give, like more of
a zoomed in idea of what you're

414
00:28:50,548 --> 00:28:55,229
doing daily, or, you know, how
the projects get chosen that

415
00:28:55,229 --> 00:28:58,199
you're working on and talk
through some of the things that

416
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:59,939
you like about that.

417
00:29:00,383 --> 00:29:03,144
Julia: okay. so I'll just talk
about what I'm working on right

418
00:29:03,144 --> 00:29:07,763
now, cuz I think that's a good
sort of snapshot right now I

419
00:29:07,763 --> 00:29:12,144
have three main projects that I'm
working on three different

420
00:29:12,144 --> 00:29:21,173
clients, three different sort of
types of work. One is

421
00:29:21,203 --> 00:29:28,554
like an API tooling company,
and I am a frequent contributor

422
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:36,054
to their technical blog. So I
just wrote a three part series on

423
00:29:37,074 --> 00:29:40,943
authentication and authorization
and an authentication best

424
00:29:40,949 --> 00:29:45,953
practices for APIs. So I'm not
writing code when I'm doing that,

425
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:51,324
but I'm doing a lot of in depth,
technical research, reading code,

426
00:29:51,324 --> 00:29:57,068
reading. You know, reading
documentation from different,

427
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:05,769
I don't know, different solutions
providers. I did an SME

428
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:10,749
interview as part of that with a
senior engineer who oversees some

429
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:16,929
of their security stuff at, at
that, at my client company.

430
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:21,669
And then writing those articles,
like for a technical audience

431
00:30:21,673 --> 00:30:26,919
writing for API developers to
say, like, here's how to approach

432
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:31,598
the decision making process. And
that was one of the things that I

433
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:35,979
try to do as a writer and like
part of why they keep bringing me

434
00:30:35,979 --> 00:30:42,759
back there is that there's a lot
of repetitive content out there.

435
00:30:43,838 --> 00:30:48,429
So if you look up like API
security, best practices, you're

436
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,219
gonna see a lot of articles that
say essentially the same thing.

437
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:59,048
Anytime you look up anything
to do with GWT, Jos, Jos JSUN web

438
00:30:59,048 --> 00:31:05,439
tokens, the first hits are
the same, like it's, everything

439
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:15,909
is so SEO optimized, like,
and what I try to do is to take a

440
00:31:15,913 --> 00:31:19,659
point of view. That's a little
bit more about like, okay,

441
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:23,709
there's a lot of options. There's
not a best option. How do we come

442
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:27,098
up with a decision making
framework? Like how do you, as a

443
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:31,058
developer, as a, you know, as a
team lead a product architect,

444
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:35,439
whatever, how do you approach the
decision making process of like,

445
00:31:35,469 --> 00:31:41,919
what's the best option for me?
So. That's kind of part of

446
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,398
what that series is about, and
I've done things like that on

447
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:51,278
other aspects of API design for
them. So that's one thing and

448
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:56,229
that's kind of the least
technical part of what I do.

449
00:31:57,578 --> 00:32:04,179
Then right now I'm working with
two other clients. One, is,

450
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:16,298
they have a GraphQL API that
coordinates the APIs for like

451
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:20,858
maybe, I don't know, just
estimating 40 different brands of

452
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:28,628
I T devices. So like your SL
smart locks or your Phillips hue,

453
00:32:28,634 --> 00:32:33,999
light bulbs, or your eco B
thermostat or whatever, each of

454
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:40,703
those has its own API and its own
app. And. As a homeowner, you can

455
00:32:40,703 --> 00:32:48,594
use like Google home or whatever,
but let's say that you were like

456
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:52,584
an apartment building
superintendent and you wanted to

457
00:32:52,584 --> 00:32:56,213
be able to manage all of the
smart devices in your buildings

458
00:32:57,114 --> 00:33:03,054
from one place. Instead of all of
those places, they make an API

459
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:09,594
that coordinates all of those
things. And, so I, but right

460
00:33:09,594 --> 00:33:16,689
now, most of their documentation
is very like marketing. Oriented.

461
00:33:16,689 --> 00:33:21,009
They it's like, they've been very
focused on just like onboarding

462
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:26,888
their first few significant
customers. And the, and their

463
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:31,598
technical onboarding has been
like super intensive, custom,

464
00:33:31,598 --> 00:33:35,679
like hand holding. And I we're,
I'm involved in helping to

465
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:41,378
transition them away from that,
like creating more standard

466
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:46,628
documentation for like those
getting started guides. So how to

467
00:33:46,628 --> 00:33:51,338
build a node app that allows you
to control all of your smart

468
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:55,209
locks, how to build an, you know,
and then eventually like

469
00:33:55,598 --> 00:33:58,358
integrating all of these
different things in there, but

470
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:03,849
also along the way, explaining,
like, why is this a GraphQL API

471
00:34:04,388 --> 00:34:11,498
instead of rest, why do we insist
on you using. A specific

472
00:34:11,503 --> 00:34:18,068
authentication protocol. And,
and there are technical reasons

473
00:34:18,068 --> 00:34:21,219
that they do all of those things
that have to do with coordinating

474
00:34:21,224 --> 00:34:27,608
between 40 different APIs. So
the content that I'm creating for

475
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:32,168
them, some of it is just creating
these sample apps and kind of

476
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:37,659
documenting the nitty gritty of
those apps. And then some of

477
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:44,918
it is the more in depth
explanations of like the why,

478
00:34:44,923 --> 00:34:49,989
of how it works. And that's
been really cool because I've

479
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:54,969
gotten to learn a lot about these
different aspects of it. Plus I

480
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:59,213
think IOT is really interesting.
We have. Everything in our house

481
00:34:59,213 --> 00:35:03,833
is smart, is like a smart device.
And, it frustrates me that

482
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:11,423
they don't talk to each other
very well it's yeah, I

483
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:14,543
think it's cool. I just, it's a
really exciting, interesting

484
00:35:14,543 --> 00:35:18,563
project to be working on. And
the engineers who work at this

485
00:35:18,563 --> 00:35:23,123
company are like, they are, they
know their stuff. Like they are

486
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:31,523
very smart people, creative,
analytical people. So it's been

487
00:35:31,523 --> 00:35:37,643
really neat working with them.
And then my other client that

488
00:35:37,643 --> 00:35:42,534
I'm working on right now working
with right now, this one is like

489
00:35:43,253 --> 00:35:47,304
simultaneously an example of what
I do and really, really, really

490
00:35:47,304 --> 00:35:52,554
do not like about my current
role. So this is a company who

491
00:35:52,554 --> 00:36:01,494
makes a player and engagement.
API for game developers. So, you

492
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:06,023
know, sending push notifications
and rewards, you know, in game

493
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:16,793
stuff. And, I'm creating a
lot of the same kind of like

494
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:25,974
getting started guides.
Because again, like they, their

495
00:36:26,403 --> 00:36:29,034
existing documentation sort of
assumes that you already know

496
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,503
what this thing does and roughly
how to use it. Like maybe you've

497
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:36,864
already been using a competitor
product and you're just switching

498
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:41,153
over. And so it's, it's not gonna
be any challenge to, but they're

499
00:36:41,153 --> 00:36:46,373
hoping to expand and, and kind of
make themselves more accessible

500
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:55,509
to a broader audience of game
developers. So. To do this,

501
00:36:55,628 --> 00:37:03,608
to create the content that they
want. I have had to learn how to

502
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:07,298
work with game code. And

503
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:08,139
Bekah: Oh, right.

504
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:14,498
Julia: I, it's just, it's not all
the same. it's like the

505
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:19,809
transition from working with a
rest API to a GraphQL API in node

506
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:24,668
is no big deal. Right. The
transition from working with one

507
00:37:24,668 --> 00:37:29,599
authentication protocol to
another in.net is no big deal,

508
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:35,409
but changing this entire
framework and way of thinking

509
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:40,688
about, project architecture
has been really, really difficult

510
00:37:40,688 --> 00:37:48,759
for me. And it's just not easy to
troubleshoot and it's, yeah,

511
00:37:48,818 --> 00:37:52,599
it's been interesting. I mean,
it's cool to be learning and

512
00:37:52,599 --> 00:38:02,199
working on something so radically
different. And I hope

513
00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:05,739
eventually I'll be able to create
some content for them that's

514
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:11,648
useful and meaningful, but,
it is definitely something where

515
00:38:11,648 --> 00:38:15,369
I'm like, oh, there has gotta be
somebody else out there who's

516
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:23,858
better qualified to do this. it's
sure not me. But it's kind of

517
00:38:23,858 --> 00:38:27,338
the nature of like, there're just
there, aren't an enormous number

518
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:32,918
of companies that do what our
company does. And I I'm

519
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:37,989
technically a freelancer, but I
almost, all my work right now is

520
00:38:37,994 --> 00:38:41,349
through, is through an agency.
And there just aren't that many

521
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:44,108
agencies that do what we do. And
we had a sales guy for a little

522
00:38:44,108 --> 00:38:51,384
while, while who was. Maybe
overselling our technical

523
00:38:51,384 --> 00:38:57,414
expertise or like overselling the
idea that, you know, developers

524
00:38:57,414 --> 00:39:07,253
could learn anything and you
know, in no time flat yeah.

525
00:39:07,373 --> 00:39:12,204
Yeah. But so that's, that's the
kind of thing, like a I'm I don't

526
00:39:12,204 --> 00:39:13,704
know. Does that answer, is that a
good

527
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,643
Bekah: Yeah, this is great. I
mean, you really broke down a lot

528
00:39:16,643 --> 00:39:20,063
of different things. Do you get
to choose the projects and the

529
00:39:20,063 --> 00:39:23,934
companies that you work with or
does the agency assign you?

530
00:39:24,744 --> 00:39:30,143
Julia: So when I first started
working with them, it was really

531
00:39:30,143 --> 00:39:38,304
just like kind of one off
freelance stuff. And over the

532
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:43,418
course of a couple years, Well
over the course of a year, you

533
00:39:43,418 --> 00:39:46,628
know, I, I took on a variety of
different projects and at first

534
00:39:46,628 --> 00:39:51,039
they were like pretty targeted to
stuff I already knew and stuff I

535
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,009
had already worked on. And then
gradually they started kind of

536
00:39:54,014 --> 00:39:56,018
pulling me in on more stuff and
saying, Hey, would you be

537
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,389
interested in this? Would you be
interested in this? And

538
00:39:59,259 --> 00:40:03,728
eventually I think that they
realized like, oh, Hey, Julia is

539
00:40:03,728 --> 00:40:07,329
a person who is happy to learn
new stuff, happy to take on

540
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:15,128
challenging clients. So, I
I'm now like I'm a 10 99, but

541
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:23,318
I'm, I'm the staff writer at, at
the agency. And I mean, I kind of

542
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:31,688
get the clients that are too
difficult to give off

543
00:40:31,688 --> 00:40:38,739
freelancers. So like I kinda get
to choose. I was. You know,

544
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:41,318
at some point they asked me like,
Hey, would you wanna work on this

545
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:46,389
crypto thing? And I was like, no,
not really. So, I mean, I do get

546
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:50,199
some input. And that first
client that I was talking about

547
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:55,539
is one where I did a few pieces
for them. They really liked it. I

548
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:58,838
was in some meetings with them. I
really liked them. And so I've

549
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:02,708
gotten, I've been able to say,
Hey, I really like working with

550
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:08,438
them. Like, I've got ideas. Let
me let, can, you know, can I take

551
00:41:08,438 --> 00:41:12,369
on more of that relationship? But
yeah,

552
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:17,438
Bekah: So, so with the ideas, do
they come in, does the company

553
00:41:17,443 --> 00:41:22,989
come in with ideas or they have
like a general, do you define.

554
00:41:23,409 --> 00:41:30,728
Julia: do our, our, I have a fly
in here. Our principal

555
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:38,003
consultant, when, when we
onboard a new client, Does a

556
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:42,384
process that they call the,
the dis the developer content

557
00:41:43,853 --> 00:41:48,293
action plan. So they do like a
developer content review where

558
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:53,664
they say like, here are the gaps
in your existing documentation.

559
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:59,483
This is what developers want to
see. This is, you know, this is,

560
00:42:00,324 --> 00:42:03,864
these are your areas of strength.
And, and they, we have kind of a,

561
00:42:03,923 --> 00:42:08,844
you know, a rubric, and then
they come up with a, an action

562
00:42:08,844 --> 00:42:14,693
plan based on that content gap
analysis. So it's a collaborative

563
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:22,284
process for sure. And the
longer I've been with the agency,

564
00:42:22,284 --> 00:42:26,994
like the more I've been able to
be involved in that process.

565
00:42:28,193 --> 00:42:34,943
Yeah. So it it's a mix, right?
Sometimes clients have wacky

566
00:42:34,943 --> 00:42:38,844
ideas about what they want.
And then we have some clients

567
00:42:38,844 --> 00:42:44,664
who've been clients for a long
time where we've moved past, like

568
00:42:44,664 --> 00:42:48,594
that content gap. And it's more
like, Hey, we would love to have,

569
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:53,693
you know, this more kind of off
the wall piece. Like I did a

570
00:42:53,693 --> 00:42:58,554
piece for Algolia around black
Friday last year, that was like

571
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:03,744
an instant inventory. It was
like, how can you use Algolia to

572
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:07,614
like, manage your black Friday
sales? And they said, you

573
00:43:07,614 --> 00:43:10,643
know, this is something we think
will like kind of republish every

574
00:43:10,643 --> 00:43:16,043
year leading up to black Friday.
So, you know, it's like that

575
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:21,023
kind of thing where it's more
like, I don't know,

576
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:26,739
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. That's fun.
What? Okay, so you've done,

577
00:43:26,949 --> 00:43:29,619
you've really broken down a lot
of the, the stuff that I was

578
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:31,748
interested in hearing about,
which is great. Like there are

579
00:43:31,748 --> 00:43:37,119
some really fun parts. There are
some parts that are not so fun or

580
00:43:37,123 --> 00:43:44,648
kind of challenging are, there
any, so I would say it sounds

581
00:43:44,648 --> 00:43:48,188
like the part that you like the
most is being able to learn new

582
00:43:48,188 --> 00:43:52,224
things, but it also seems pretty
fun to be able to develop. Those

583
00:43:52,224 --> 00:43:54,954
deeper relationships with the
clients too, that.

584
00:43:57,018 --> 00:44:04,748
Julia: And, I, I really, I
like that. I've been able to

585
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:09,009
recently kind of develop these
more in depth relationships with

586
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:16,869
clients. It's a mixed bag
though, because the consultant

587
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:24,128
client relationship is, as I'm
sure you both know, not always

588
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:32,018
the easiest relationship to
navigate. And as a contractor

589
00:44:32,018 --> 00:44:37,599
with my agency, like, I'm always
kind of like a little on guard

590
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,938
about like, oh my God, I, I'm not
even an employee of this company.

591
00:44:42,943 --> 00:44:47,918
Exactly. Like if I say the wrong
thing and like upset this client,

592
00:44:47,949 --> 00:44:53,648
like, ah, you know, it's my butt
on the line. And our, our

593
00:44:53,648 --> 00:45:00,438
principal consultant is like an
amazing guy. but it's just not,

594
00:45:00,528 --> 00:45:07,143
it's not the same as like a.
Being part of the same team, like

595
00:45:07,143 --> 00:45:11,764
that manager relationship where
like, like, I don't know, I just,

596
00:45:12,664 --> 00:45:16,414
there's always this like added
level of stress in conversations

597
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:19,393
with clients where I'm like, oh,
I really hope I don't say the

598
00:45:19,393 --> 00:45:29,403
wrong thing. But I do like it
and I think that like, whatever

599
00:45:29,403 --> 00:45:37,773
the next move is in my career,
I, I wanna have it be

600
00:45:37,773 --> 00:45:41,884
something where I have more
depth,

601
00:45:42,528 --> 00:45:42,648
Bekah: Hmm.

602
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:45,844
Julia: more depth in my
relationships with people, but

603
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:51,364
also like more depth in working
with a, a more focused tech

604
00:45:51,364 --> 00:45:56,733
stack, because it does get pretty
exhausting, like just bouncing

605
00:45:56,739 --> 00:46:00,333
from one thing to another and
kind of feeling like. I never

606
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:06,063
work with any one thing long
enough to really have any

607
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:10,534
mastery. And like, I know I'm
learning cuz when I come back to

608
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:19,023
stuff later, like I can achieve
more complex results and I can

609
00:46:19,204 --> 00:46:22,443
work faster and I can
troubleshoot better. But like I

610
00:46:22,443 --> 00:46:27,813
don't ever feel, I, I never
exactly feel competent.

611
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:28,858
Bekah: Yeah.

612
00:46:29,494 --> 00:46:33,063
Julia: and that's kinda tough
sometimes.

613
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:35,268
Dan: get that. I mean, like
digging in all the way into

614
00:46:35,268 --> 00:46:40,009
something can feel good. You
know, I was gonna make some joke

615
00:46:40,009 --> 00:46:42,679
about how that's like, just being
a JavaScript in general, where

616
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:44,949
everything's always new and
changing, you but,

617
00:46:45,164 --> 00:46:45,773
Julia: That's

618
00:46:46,188 --> 00:46:46,509
Dan: then it's.

619
00:46:46,923 --> 00:46:49,114
Julia: an industry wide
phenomenon.

620
00:46:49,398 --> 00:46:53,179
Dan: Right, but still, I mean, I,
you know, I still have been doing

621
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:56,599
rack for like years, you know,
and it's like, I actually know it

622
00:46:56,659 --> 00:46:58,309
like pretty well. You know what I
mean? And

623
00:46:58,384 --> 00:47:04,143
Julia: Yeah. And it's like, you
know, earlier this spring I was

624
00:47:04,143 --> 00:47:12,724
working on this kind of
complicated.net sequel thing, and

625
00:47:13,474 --> 00:47:18,514
then I'm working in unity and I
have to learn Xcode and how to do

626
00:47:18,514 --> 00:47:24,264
iOS development. And also on the
side, I'm working with GraphQL

627
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:29,313
and like, it's like, I just, I
mean, I really bounce around a

628
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:32,463
lot and occasionally they'll be
like, do you know, angular? And

629
00:47:32,463 --> 00:47:38,974
I'm like, oh, that's the GraphQL
client. We're all in agreement.

630
00:47:38,974 --> 00:47:42,273
That the next thing, the next
deliverable is for me to do

631
00:47:42,273 --> 00:47:46,114
something in flutter. And I'm
like, oh, for Christ's sake,

632
00:47:46,324 --> 00:47:48,153
Dan: Yeah, you were, I saw, you
mentioned that on slack. I don't

633
00:47:48,153 --> 00:47:49,893
even know what fluter is really,
what

634
00:47:49,963 --> 00:47:56,239
Julia: it's, it's a
mobile framework, so it's like a,

635
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:01,398
but it's so,

636
00:48:01,923 --> 00:48:02,224
Dan: apps.

637
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:05,179
Julia: yeah. But it's,

638
00:48:05,344 --> 00:48:05,853
Dan: I could look it up.

639
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:08,914
Bekah: it seems like a react
native competitor. Am I

640
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:12,588
Julia: it's a react native
competitor. It, I can't remember

641
00:48:12,588 --> 00:48:15,978
what the big advantage is.
Overreact native.

642
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:18,574
Bekah: I've heard a lot of react.
Native people say there's no

643
00:48:18,574 --> 00:48:19,054
advantage.

644
00:48:21,603 --> 00:48:25,324
Dan: well, react native is really
annoying. So if this is

645
00:48:25,324 --> 00:48:28,293
better than, you I've just
started my first react. I just

646
00:48:28,298 --> 00:48:30,483
started digging to react native
for the first time, like a month

647
00:48:30,489 --> 00:48:32,884
or two ago. And I'm I'm phase.

648
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:36,528
Julia: And the, and the idea is
that like, like react native

649
00:48:36,588 --> 00:48:42,199
it's, it's like device
agnostic. Like it's not like

650
00:48:42,409 --> 00:48:44,298
writing an iOS app or

651
00:48:44,494 --> 00:48:46,923
Dan: Right, right. Wants,
published anywhere kind of thing.

652
00:48:47,253 --> 00:48:47,463
Yeah.

653
00:48:47,568 --> 00:48:47,958
Julia: Yeah.

654
00:48:48,784 --> 00:48:51,543
Dan: Yeah. I mean, starting from
scratch, I in a, like a big way,

655
00:48:51,543 --> 00:48:55,923
like that is, is hard. You know,
I was, I was just thinking in my

656
00:48:55,923 --> 00:48:58,594
head, I was just like outlining a
blog post about like how I

657
00:48:58,713 --> 00:49:01,384
learned things, you know, from
scratch, you know, and like the

658
00:49:01,384 --> 00:49:04,173
bigger it is, like the it's just
like you were talking about the

659
00:49:04,173 --> 00:49:09,784
game app, right? The like,
the further away from what you're

660
00:49:09,784 --> 00:49:12,844
used to it is the harder it is. I
mean, like, that's an like

661
00:49:12,844 --> 00:49:15,664
obvious statement, but it's like,
it's, it's much more for me. It's

662
00:49:15,664 --> 00:49:19,954
much more exhausting too and
takes longer, but it's also like

663
00:49:20,614 --> 00:49:24,034
harder you know, you know what I
mean? Like it's not just a

664
00:49:24,063 --> 00:49:26,434
simple, oh, it just takes two
days instead of half an hour. If

665
00:49:26,438 --> 00:49:28,563
it's, you know, some package or
whatever, you know,

666
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:30,349
Julia: Well, it's like, you know,
we

667
00:49:30,713 --> 00:49:31,534
Dan: eh, it's hard

668
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:34,849
Julia: we're all, all like the
idea that it's hard to estimate

669
00:49:34,853 --> 00:49:38,778
how long things will take is
obviously well known phenomenon.

670
00:49:39,588 --> 00:49:41,989
But when you don't know anything,

671
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:43,068
Dan: Yeah.

672
00:49:43,338 --> 00:49:45,829
Julia: it's impossible to
estimate.

673
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:47,028
Dan: Oh, I mean,

674
00:49:47,114 --> 00:49:50,148
Julia: probably roughly estimate
how long it'll take me to like,

675
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,778
write something in flutter,
because I read about it and I was

676
00:49:53,778 --> 00:49:56,869
like, oh, okay. This is not
radically different than anything

677
00:49:56,869 --> 00:50:02,329
I've done before. But with game
development, it's like, oh, GE

678
00:50:02,509 --> 00:50:06,949
like this is, you know, there's
just reams of files that I'm

679
00:50:06,949 --> 00:50:11,088
like, I have no idea what any of
these do.

680
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:12,289
Dan: Yeah.

681
00:50:12,798 --> 00:50:17,568
Julia: you know, I don't know.
It's just, and yeah, I'm, I'm

682
00:50:17,568 --> 00:50:24,588
a terrible jaw clincher, like I
just all day, every day and. Over

683
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:28,278
the last few months as I've been
working on this, like these few

684
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:33,829
particularly difficult projects,
I, I actually went to the dentist

685
00:50:33,858 --> 00:50:40,068
and I was like, you have to help.
I'm going crazy. So that's why I

686
00:50:40,068 --> 00:50:45,858
now sugar free, worth original.
I'm like an 80 year old diabetic.

687
00:50:47,539 --> 00:50:52,039
I suck on sugar free where
there's original all day. Cause

688
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:53,628
it me punching my teeth.

689
00:50:54,094 --> 00:50:58,503
Bekah: that's interesting. My
dentist me to my chiropractor to

690
00:50:58,503 --> 00:51:02,974
have my jaw adjusted. That is one
of like the most awkward,

691
00:51:03,244 --> 00:51:08,193
uncomfortable adjustments that I
have had. But I am also a jaw

692
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:12,903
clincher and it was causing my
tooth to grow thickening roots

693
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,824
that were starting to protrude in
my gums.

694
00:51:16,009 --> 00:51:22,653
Julia: yeah, yeah, no, that's
what I like. we don't need to get

695
00:51:22,653 --> 00:51:23,884
into my oral health.

696
00:51:27,228 --> 00:51:29,929
Dan: You mentioned the, you
know, estimating and all that

697
00:51:29,929 --> 00:51:32,358
stuff. And I, I actually, like, I
was been wondering about this

698
00:51:32,364 --> 00:51:34,009
since you talked about it,
especially since you're a

699
00:51:34,009 --> 00:51:38,659
contractor, how, like how it
works, what, like your

700
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:41,748
arrangement. I mean, you get an
assignment of writing an article

701
00:51:41,748 --> 00:51:45,318
about something that you don't
know about yet. And so like, how

702
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:47,748
does that, how does that break
down? How does, how does what's

703
00:51:47,748 --> 00:51:50,449
the process of like, cause cuz if
I have a project, you know, maybe

704
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:52,938
I try to estimate it or something
and there's always unknowns, but

705
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,199
with writing assignments, lot of
times it's, there's other, you

706
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:59,599
know, it's per pagers. Like
there's like, there's lots of

707
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,164
different ways. And so is it
just. You kind of treat it like a

708
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:05,554
software project and estimate
hourly and deliver a at the end.

709
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:08,074
Julia: process, the writing
process doesn't really take me

710
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:15,213
that much time. So like, if I'm
writing that I already

711
00:52:15,213 --> 00:52:21,514
understand. Really well, or just
like a very simple API where I

712
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:28,324
just wanna show like very basic,
like here's, here's how to call

713
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:33,094
it the first time. I know
very well, how long that'll take

714
00:52:33,094 --> 00:52:39,873
me, like the writing process?
Just, it's just, it's like, as, I

715
00:52:39,873 --> 00:52:45,934
don't know, the, so one of the
differences is when I was working

716
00:52:46,143 --> 00:52:50,614
before I kind of got brought in
house as a staff writer, then I

717
00:52:50,614 --> 00:52:58,563
was paid by piece. And it was
a standard rate. And the

718
00:52:58,563 --> 00:53:03,333
pieces that I was getting were
pretty standardized, at the

719
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:07,503
point that. It started getting
more complex, where it was like,

720
00:53:07,503 --> 00:53:12,003
Hey, stuff's coming back to me
from the client, like asking me

721
00:53:12,003 --> 00:53:17,253
for a lot of revisions that like
were not in scope you know, then

722
00:53:17,253 --> 00:53:21,813
it was like, we have a
conversation about changing how

723
00:53:21,813 --> 00:53:27,034
I'm compensated? Because this is
not, this is not standard now.

724
00:53:27,094 --> 00:53:32,583
I'm paid a, a monthly
retainer and our project manager

725
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:37,684
sort of, I com I communicate with
her about like where I'm at on

726
00:53:37,684 --> 00:53:44,494
different stuff. And we kind of
scale how, how much I take on

727
00:53:44,494 --> 00:53:47,043
just based on how long things are
taking. So,

728
00:53:47,063 --> 00:53:47,873
Dan: Yeah. Nice.

729
00:53:48,244 --> 00:53:51,634
Julia: yeah. Yeah. It's not,
it's, it's pretty, it's pretty

730
00:53:51,634 --> 00:53:56,793
flexible. They had expectations.
When I came on board as a staff

731
00:53:56,793 --> 00:54:01,173
writer that turned out to be like
really wacky, but everybody

732
00:54:01,293 --> 00:54:06,648
realized it very quickly, like. I
cannot produce 10 articles a

733
00:54:06,648 --> 00:54:10,159
month if I have to learn an
entirely new framework for every

734
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:10,938
single article.

735
00:54:11,034 --> 00:54:14,449
Bekah: don't know if anybody can
produce 10 articles a month.

736
00:54:14,748 --> 00:54:16,998
Like, that's just a lot of,

737
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:22,159
Julia: Yeah. I mean, I could do
10, if they're all just like,

738
00:54:23,074 --> 00:54:24,094
Dan: It's stuff you already know,

739
00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:25,699
Julia: yeah. 500 words on,

740
00:54:26,673 --> 00:54:27,063
Dan: Yeah.

741
00:54:27,918 --> 00:54:28,398
Julia: you know,

742
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:29,594
Dan: No, that's cool.

743
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:35,778
Julia: why you should have docs
for your API. I'm good. I could

744
00:54:35,778 --> 00:54:42,768
write a lot of those, but,
yeah. It's I don't know. It's

745
00:54:42,768 --> 00:54:45,139
interesting though. I think I was
talking about this with you

746
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:53,239
recently. Bekah like feeling kind
of like, I do think I'm underpaid

747
00:54:53,628 --> 00:54:59,688
maybe because I think that the
amount that I actually get done.

748
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:07,159
Is probably on par with somebody
who's a full-time employee.

749
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:16,858
But I'm paid as a part-time 10 99
employee because I don't have

750
00:55:17,568 --> 00:55:23,298
this sort of like official role
in the organization. The

751
00:55:23,298 --> 00:55:33,559
upside is I have very few
meetings which I love. But

752
00:55:34,309 --> 00:55:43,759
it's also harder to kind of, I, I
don't, it's hard for me to really

753
00:55:43,759 --> 00:55:51,454
like, figure out. What like
what my compensation should be,

754
00:55:51,454 --> 00:55:55,833
because I don't really know how,
like my role compares to somebody

755
00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:58,713
who's in house somewhere.
Although I will say I interviewed

756
00:55:58,713 --> 00:56:03,003
for a role somewhere recently
where they said something like,

757
00:56:03,244 --> 00:56:06,514
oh, our full-time writers, right.
About four articles a month. And

758
00:56:06,514 --> 00:56:17,014
I was like, what? Oh, okay. I
could do that very easily.

759
00:56:18,063 --> 00:56:18,483
but

760
00:56:18,824 --> 00:56:23,253
Dan: Well, no, I mean, that's,
that's, I mean, yeah, it's gotta

761
00:56:23,253 --> 00:56:25,773
be tough, but like the, I, you
know, I was thinking about this

762
00:56:25,773 --> 00:56:28,728
when you were. Talking about the
like actual different articles

763
00:56:28,728 --> 00:56:31,668
you were writing. And you know,
some of the thought processes

764
00:56:31,668 --> 00:56:35,929
you're explaining are complex
things, right. That, that, that

765
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:38,958
are targeted towards more senior
developers. Right. You're not

766
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:42,559
writing the, you're not being
asked to write the like, sort of

767
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:44,929
super, I mean, maybe you are, but
like

768
00:56:45,454 --> 00:56:46,474
Julia: yeah. On.

769
00:56:46,579 --> 00:56:48,978
Dan: of times you're not writing
the super intro basic stuff or

770
00:56:48,978 --> 00:56:52,309
the SEO, you know, fodder stuff.
Right.

771
00:56:52,489 --> 00:56:55,489
Julia: No. Right. And that's
something that we like as a

772
00:56:55,489 --> 00:57:01,878
company like, listen, we're,
we'll like try to make the stuff

773
00:57:01,878 --> 00:57:07,938
that we write reasonably
optimized, SEO wise, but that's

774
00:57:07,938 --> 00:57:14,208
not what we're here for. Like, we
are not here to like, you know,

775
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:18,048
just create fluff content. Like
we want content that actually

776
00:57:18,054 --> 00:57:24,679
engages developers for the long
term. And there is definitely

777
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:29,208
like, you have to be
discoverable. And some of

778
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:35,148
that is like identifying search
terms that just have really low

779
00:57:35,148 --> 00:57:42,708
results volume. So. For example,
just recently, it was like, we

780
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:46,248
noticed that there's very few
results for the search phrase,

781
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:49,608
JSON payload. And so we went to
one of our clients and we're

782
00:57:49,608 --> 00:57:54,858
like, can we write something on
this term? Like it's relevant to

783
00:57:54,858 --> 00:57:58,458
you. And like it's relevant to
developers. People are searching

784
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:03,889
for it. And there's not that much
content. But it's based on

785
00:58:03,893 --> 00:58:07,309
the idea that like, people are
searching for this because they

786
00:58:07,398 --> 00:58:11,869
want information, not like
they're searching for it. And so

787
00:58:11,873 --> 00:58:18,228
like let's, let's create the
fluff. I think so the, the

788
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:21,619
principal of our, the principal
consultant is, he wrote a

789
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:24,708
book called developer marketing
does not exist, which I think is

790
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:29,389
kind of a goofy title. That was a
face of recognition. Bekah do you

791
00:58:29,389 --> 00:58:30,079
know the book?

792
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,018
Bekah: Yes. It's I don't know who
recommended it to me. It's

793
00:58:33,018 --> 00:58:35,329
definitely on my list of books
that I should.

794
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:39,588
Julia: Yeah. He's and the
idea is basically like, if

795
00:58:39,588 --> 00:58:43,009
developers feel like they're
being marketed to, like, they're

796
00:58:43,009 --> 00:58:47,119
not gonna, nobody wants that.
Like, I wanna know that a product

797
00:58:47,449 --> 00:58:51,139
is gonna actually solve my
problem. I wanna know that like,

798
00:58:51,139 --> 00:58:55,608
if I start using something, I'm
gonna be fully supported in my

799
00:58:55,639 --> 00:59:00,228
journey as a technical user. And
so like, the content that we're

800
00:59:00,228 --> 00:59:04,909
creating is really geared towards
that developer experience of

801
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:10,608
like, okay, great. You made it to
our website, you signed, you

802
00:59:10,608 --> 00:59:15,889
know, you signed up for your free
trial account. Are you gonna

803
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:20,748
actually be able to get stuff
done? And are you gonna feel

804
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:27,768
successful and empowered by the
content that you find here?

805
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:31,789
Or are you gonna feel like you're
being. You know, told exactly how

806
00:59:31,789 --> 00:59:33,829
to do it. And if you wanna do
anything different, you have

807
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:40,338
absolutely no idea to make it
work. Yeah. I can't remember

808
00:59:40,338 --> 00:59:43,039
what you said that made me just
that, but

809
00:59:43,489 --> 00:59:45,708
Dan: I was just talking about
the, yeah, I was talking about

810
00:59:45,713 --> 00:59:50,179
how, the content you're
writing is, is, is, talking

811
00:59:50,179 --> 00:59:52,518
about some high level concepts
and, you know,

812
00:59:52,699 --> 00:59:53,268
Julia: oh yeah, yeah,

813
00:59:54,168 --> 00:59:56,568
Dan: it was mostly just mostly
just like you're operating on

814
00:59:56,574 --> 01:00:00,768
like a senior developer level,
you know, and you were talking

815
01:00:00,768 --> 01:00:02,869
about competition before, and
that's what made me start talking

816
01:00:02,869 --> 01:00:05,329
about this, you know, but,
like the,

817
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:09,108
Julia: then the hard part of the
hard thing for me is like, I

818
01:00:09,108 --> 01:00:13,608
really genuinely love what I do
and that actually makes it harder

819
01:00:13,909 --> 01:00:18,108
for me to like fight for the
compensation

820
01:00:18,934 --> 01:00:20,494
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. I hear that.

821
01:00:20,688 --> 01:00:25,728
Julia: with the fact that right
now, like I work from 10 to three

822
01:00:27,139 --> 01:00:31,954
roughly. Sometimes I work a
little in the evenings. Sometimes

823
01:00:31,954 --> 01:00:36,184
I get started a little earlier in
the morning, but like, I really

824
01:00:36,184 --> 01:00:38,704
only work like 20, 25 hours a
week.

825
01:00:39,724 --> 01:00:40,023
Dan: Yeah.

826
01:00:40,923 --> 01:00:45,873
Julia: And I'm, I just, I know
that like taking a full-time job,

827
01:00:45,873 --> 01:00:48,844
like the difference that
additional 10 to 15 hours a week

828
01:00:48,873 --> 01:00:54,393
is just gonna be meetings and
like annoying emails. And like, I

829
01:00:54,393 --> 01:00:59,583
don't like, am I willing to take
less money to not deal with that

830
01:00:59,588 --> 01:01:02,643
stuff? Like, and have the
flexibility, my schedule, like,

831
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:03,143
yeah.

832
01:01:03,414 --> 01:01:07,054
Dan: I mean, if really, really
wanted or needed more money, you

833
01:01:07,054 --> 01:01:09,123
could pick up more clients too.
Like that's the beauty of being

834
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:10,744
independent. So you can do,

835
01:01:11,494 --> 01:01:17,884
Julia: I could. And, I do,
you know, I toy it with that but

836
01:01:18,063 --> 01:01:20,193
Dan: or just raise your rates.
You know, it's all, it's all,

837
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:21,603
good Just send up an email.
That'll be fine.

838
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:28,429
Julia: yeah, It's true. I have
such anxiety about, I think I

839
01:01:28,429 --> 01:01:31,639
better deliver a couple of
successful projects on these two

840
01:01:31,639 --> 01:01:34,518
nightmare clients. Before I for

841
01:01:35,554 --> 01:01:39,454
Dan: Say now that I am a game
developer, this is my new rate.

842
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:45,739
Julia: game developers are paid

843
01:01:47,224 --> 01:01:50,704
Dan: Now that I'm a flutter
developer, this is my new rate.

844
01:01:50,778 --> 01:01:53,628
Julia: Developers are like
hideously underpaid,

845
01:01:54,664 --> 01:01:56,614
Dan: Well, now that I'm

846
01:01:58,903 --> 01:02:00,614
Bekah: An angular developer.

847
01:02:00,963 --> 01:02:05,764
Dan: I'll write it for you. To
whom it may concern.

848
01:02:07,909 --> 01:02:11,119
Julia: it's interesting. The
whole game development world is

849
01:02:11,123 --> 01:02:12,139
like its own.

850
01:02:12,909 --> 01:02:18,333
Dan: don't know anything about
it. Yeah. far separated from It

851
01:02:18,338 --> 01:02:21,543
is weird. Like you think about
it, cuz I, you know, I get a lot

852
01:02:21,543 --> 01:02:24,094
of overlap. I mean obviously most
of my overlap is with other web

853
01:02:24,094 --> 01:02:26,643
developers in different
technologies, but even so

854
01:02:26,643 --> 01:02:30,934
there's, I don't know anybody
does game develop it, you know,

855
01:02:30,934 --> 01:02:32,733
it's like, and I know a lot of
developers and

856
01:02:32,809 --> 01:02:36,978
Julia: Yeah. I mean, I've lived
in Seattle for 17 years. Like

857
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:45,768
I've know people at so many
different tech companies, I know

858
01:02:45,768 --> 01:02:51,018
recruiters all over the place.
And at one point I was, somebody

859
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:54,199
had expressed an interest in
working for a game company and I

860
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:59,418
was like, well, I'll reach out.
But like, it was like, you know,

861
01:02:59,418 --> 01:03:03,829
one person was like, well, I, I
know that the VP of HR at wizards

862
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:07,148
of the coast, but that's about as
close as I can get. I was like,

863
01:03:07,148 --> 01:03:10,068
well, I don't think that's quite
what we're looking for.

864
01:03:14,778 --> 01:03:18,378
Bekah: Well, Julia, this has been
a really great conversation and,

865
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:26,088
but it is. Time to wrap it
up. So is there any last words of

866
01:03:26,088 --> 01:03:32,599
wisdom you have for our listeners
or, things you want them to,

867
01:03:33,048 --> 01:03:35,418
you think they would benefit from
learning about.

868
01:03:36,978 --> 01:03:42,972
Julia: I don't, I was
talking with David Albert a

869
01:03:42,972 --> 01:03:47,802
couple weeks ago, and we were
talking about the idea that like

870
01:03:53,353 --> 01:03:57,523
was after I gave the lunch and
learn about feedback. We were

871
01:03:57,523 --> 01:04:05,262
talking about the idea that like
giving feedback, being mentor of

872
01:04:05,262 --> 01:04:12,463
some kind formal or informal.
sort of an intrinsic part of your

873
01:04:12,463 --> 01:04:20,172
responsibility in, in the tech
industry. And I, I think it's

874
01:04:20,177 --> 01:04:23,682
a really, it's something I think
about a fair amount that like,

875
01:04:24,132 --> 01:04:29,802
you know, I don't necessarily
have like a huge wealth of

876
01:04:29,802 --> 01:04:34,152
technical experience. I
haven't been in the industry that

877
01:04:34,157 --> 01:04:38,472
long, but I think it's just
really important for everybody to

878
01:04:38,472 --> 01:04:44,773
remember that like you have
valuable experience and knowledge

879
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:51,282
and skills and insight, and you
know, all of us are always

880
01:04:51,282 --> 01:04:59,713
learning and we should all always
be teaching as well. And

881
01:04:59,717 --> 01:05:06,402
that's not, that's not like to
say that you need to be. You

882
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:12,043
know, giving formal instruction
on something, but that, like, we

883
01:05:12,103 --> 01:05:18,043
all benefit from people sharing
what they know, sharing their

884
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:26,592
perspectives. You may not be
an expert in anything, but you're

885
01:05:26,713 --> 01:05:30,612
an expert in being yourself.
Right. you know, and it's like, I

886
01:05:31,123 --> 01:05:35,322
talking with somebody who has a
lot of experience in, in like,

887
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:39,012
tech support. And I was like,
listen, you may not think of

888
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:46,032
yourself this way, but you are a
UX expert. Like, you know, more

889
01:05:46,873 --> 01:05:53,503
about actual user experience than
like almost anybody. If you've

890
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:57,463
worked in tech support for three
years or whatever, like you have

891
01:05:57,463 --> 01:06:03,702
so much hands on knowledge and
insight into how people use

892
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:11,413
technology. Share that like, but
also like before you can share

893
01:06:11,413 --> 01:06:15,072
it, you have to actually reflect
on it and try to like give it

894
01:06:15,072 --> 01:06:18,822
some framework. And I think
that that's something I've really

895
01:06:18,822 --> 01:06:28,242
been trying to do. Myself is
like, I know that I know things,

896
01:06:28,242 --> 01:06:32,382
how can I put them in a framework
that allows me to share them with

897
01:06:32,382 --> 01:06:39,103
other people? So yeah, we're
all always learning. We also

898
01:06:39,108 --> 01:06:44,503
should all always be teaching and
I think that's, I know. Yeah,

899
01:06:44,943 --> 01:06:47,112
Bekah: I love that. That's so
great. And what a great way to

900
01:06:47,112 --> 01:06:49,693
end this episode. So thanks so
much, Julia, for being with us.

901
01:06:49,693 --> 01:06:50,632
We, we had a great

902
01:06:50,682 --> 01:06:52,333
Julia: absolutely. My

903
01:06:52,637 --> 01:06:56,112
Dan: Julia. Also I looked
that up and the most expensive,

904
01:06:56,202 --> 01:07:00,222
precious metal is rhodium. So if
you are going that direction,

905
01:07:00,222 --> 01:07:02,623
rhodium is gonna be where you're
going. I've never heard of it

906
01:07:02,793 --> 01:07:08,922
Julia: rhodium. Well, I know.
Jewelry is plated,

907
01:07:10,617 --> 01:07:11,128
Dan: That's cause

908
01:07:11,413 --> 01:07:11,532
Julia: but

909
01:07:11,818 --> 01:07:16,797
Dan: cuz it's fancy. I don't, I
don't know.

910
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:19,108
Bekah: I don't believe you.

911
01:07:19,498 --> 01:07:22,708
Dan: it's used for, oh, it's very
reflective. So it's used in

912
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:26,418
search lights, mirrors and
jewelry. I think it's mostly just

913
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:35,418
that it's rare. I don't know.
Anyway, that's it. all I got. All

914
01:07:35,422 --> 01:07:46,757
right. Cool. Well thank you,
Julia. This is great. Well, I had

915
01:07:46,757 --> 01:07:50,297
the tab open from, before and
then I, I forgot about it. I

916
01:07:50,297 --> 01:08:00,077
didn't wanna. Okay. Julia.

917
01:08:00,972 --> 01:08:01,494
Julia: Thank you.
