00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:12,000
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 6, Episode 6

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,586
of the

3
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:15,006
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

4
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:17,426
that

5
00:00:17,426 --> 00:00:21,266
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

6
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:22,811
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

7
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:24,356
their

8
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:26,937
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

9
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:29,172
stories and what they've
learned. Here -- and we're here

10
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:31,407
to share it

11
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:34,300
with you. Here with me-

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:34,700
Dan: You've said it [??].

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,402
Bekah: -[laughs] is my cohost,
Dan.

14
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,637
Dan Ott: Hey, Bekah. How's it
going?

15
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:40,572
Bekah: Hey. It's fantastic
[chuckles].

16
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:46,256
Dan: [Laughs] Yes. We are in a
silly mood cuz we just finished

17
00:00:46,262 --> 00:00:51,057
recording with Julia Seidman.
Developer, educator, she's

18
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:53,966
independent consultant, and
she's had really long and

19
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:56,006
interesting career, couple
different roles. And- and it was

20
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:58,046
a

21
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:00,447
really good time. It was a very
silly time as well. So, we-

22
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:02,906
we- we had a good time talking
to Julia, as always.

23
00:01:03,307 --> 00:01:05,966
Bekah: We did. We had a- a deep
dive into our intro

24
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,691
question. So I think that we
have set the record for longest

25
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:09,416
ever

26
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:14,066
intro because we explored quite
a few tangents.

27
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:17,081
Dan: Yes. But we learned some
things along the way, right

28
00:01:17,081 --> 00:01:18,866
[chuckles]?

29
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:23,277
Bekah: We did. Some very- very
interesting things about

30
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:27,716
exploring different technologies
as developer educator, and what

31
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:28,316
that career path looks like.

32
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,281
Dan: Mm-hmm. And also --

33
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:31,946
Bekah: Also about rhodium. [Dan
laughs] You gotta- you gotta

34
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:33,611
listen the end of the

35
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:34,700
episode, though. If you wanna-

36
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,300
Dan: You did that [laughs].

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,632
Bekah: -know about rhodium.

38
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:41,516
Dan: Yeah. No. Julia has a- a
really great outlook on

39
00:01:41,576 --> 00:01:43,647
pretty much everything, you
know? She talks a lot about how

40
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:45,464
education is important in her
writing process. And- and she

41
00:01:45,464 --> 00:01:47,276
has

42
00:01:47,277 --> 00:01:50,246
this -- I don't know if it's a
ethos or whatever, but [laughs]

43
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:53,215
she

44
00:01:53,216 --> 00:01:56,134
says, "Embrace the careen over
the career," right? And I, as

45
00:01:56,134 --> 00:01:59,052
another

46
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,636
person who -- I never thought
about it like that exactly. But,

47
00:02:00,636 --> 00:02:02,220
I

48
00:02:02,227 --> 00:02:04,811
very much appreciate that- that
look in life. I think it's

49
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:09,372
very healthy one too. So, yeah.
I don't know. I -- it was- it

50
00:02:09,377 --> 00:02:11,127
was a good time, and it was fun.
So I -- this is -- I'm horrible

51
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:12,877
at

52
00:02:12,877 --> 00:02:13,987
ending things. This is [Bekah
laughs] -- I- I -- it hasn't

53
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:15,097
gotten better.

54
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:20,212
Bekah: I think that's probably
my- my job to pick up with. We

55
00:02:20,212 --> 00:02:23,272
start every episode of the
podcast like we start every

56
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:26,122
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name,where

57
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:31,673
we're from, what we do, and a
random check-in question. And we

58
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:37,980
hope that you enjoy this
episode. Our intro question

59
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:44,287
today is if

60
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:49,268
you could have an unlimited
supply of one non-food thing for

61
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:52,733
the rest of your life, what
would it be? My name is Bekah. I

62
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:56,198
am a

63
00:02:56,198 --> 00:03:01,099
technical community builder at a
sm- [laughs] it's not what I

64
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:06,000
normally say.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,027
Dan: What?

66
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:07,300
Bekah: I don't know. Hi-

67
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,000
Julia Seidman: [Unintelligible].

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,587
Bekah: -I'm Bekah

69
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:10,957
Dan: It- it sounded good.

70
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:13,732
Bekah: It -- but it was like --
I don't -- that's just not what

71
00:03:13,732 --> 00:03:15,247
I normally

72
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:17,918
say. And then my brain was like,
"What are you doing? This is not

73
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:20,807
how we do this thing." Alright,
brain --

74
00:03:20,918 --> 00:03:23,048
Dan: That's what my brain does
every time, except that there's

75
00:03:23,048 --> 00:03:24,247
not a normal thing that it
suppose to be doing.

76
00:03:24,277 --> 00:03:26,798
Bekah: Well, that's because you
don't know what you do. You're

77
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:28,358
very confused about --

78
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:32,467
Julia: Same. Same.

79
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:36,277
Bekah: Hi, I'm Bekah. I'm a
technical community builder at

80
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:41,078
DeepGram, from a small town in
Ohio, and an unlimited supply of

81
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:45,457
one nod food thing for the rest
of my life [silence] I -- this

82
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:49,836
is just,

83
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:53,737
I don't know where to go with
this. I really like

84
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:56,737
n-notebooks and pens, but that's
two things. So that should it

85
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,706
be,

86
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:03,397
like, practical and does it just
automatically appear? Because

87
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:07,298
like, I, for a long time, kept
forgetting to buy light bulbs.

88
00:04:07,302 --> 00:04:10,927
And so we were in the dark all
the time. So -- or like triple A

89
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:13,358
batteries. I don't -- I'm just
--

90
00:04:13,432 --> 00:04:13,832
Julia: Oh, that's a good one.

91
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:16,867
Bekah: And non food items. All I
really wanted is-

92
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:17,392
Julia: Always have double A's.

93
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:17,858
Bekah: -non food [laughs].

94
00:04:18,622 --> 00:04:20,833
Julia: I always have double A's.
Never have triple A's.

95
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:24,007
Bekah: Yeah, exactly. Or like
that one time you need a D

96
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:26,500
battery and I'm like, "What
the?" No, I don't have a D

97
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,940
battery. So I don't --

98
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:29,975
Julia: Or you wanna show your
kid what happens when you look

99
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:30,994
at nine

100
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:34,076
volt and you don't have a nine
volt.

101
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:35,000
Bekah: [Laughs] Am I supposed-

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,500
Dan: Yeah. True.

103
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:35,990
Bekah: -to show my kid that?

104
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:39,576
Julia: I don't know. I feel like
it's a right of passage.

105
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:42,321
Bekah: I don't even understand
what that -- I've never heard of

106
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:42,800
that.

107
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:44,495
Dan: Go try it. See what
happens.

108
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,891
Bekah: I don't have a nine volt
[Bekah and Dan laugh].

109
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,700
Julia: My dad was a science
teacher. We do a lot of

110
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,156
questionable things.

111
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,285
Bekah: Dry ice is really fun.
You can do -- my dad was a

112
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:01,070
pharmacist.

113
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:02,676
I remember, like, sometimes he
would bring home dry ice. I

114
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:04,281
don't know. Like,

115
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,071
something shipped in it. I'm
like, "This is the coolest thing

116
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:09,891
ever." I'll just go with dry
ice. I'm gonna have an unlimited

117
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:12,300
supply of dry ice for the rest
of my life [laughs]. I don't

118
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,900
know what I'm gonna do with it.
But that's what I'm gonna go

119
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,060
with [Bekah and Julia laugh].

120
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:20,315
Dan: Alright. Well, you'll have
lots of ... well, steam or,

121
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:22,206
well, that's not really steam,
is it? It's the --

122
00:05:22,286 --> 00:05:23,000
Julia: It -- the- the-

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,300
Dan: Steam?

124
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,805
Julia: -chemical process is
called sublimation.

125
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:28,475
Dan: Yeah, but what is the thing
called? The --

126
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:28,800
Julia: It's- it's --

127
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,500
Dan: Double mates?

128
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,700
Julia: -steam. It's when a solid
[unintelligible].

129
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:32,500
Dan: It's steam. Okay. I-it's
steam. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,300
Julia: Yeah.

131
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,755
Dan: All right. Cool. Hi
[laughs], I

132
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:43,896
am Dan. I do stuff. I- I am a
independent, computer person,

133
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:50,315
developer guy. Yeah, I'm from
Cleveland. And, yeah. I think,

134
00:05:50,346 --> 00:05:52,625
time is what I'm going with.
That would be the thing that

135
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,300
I have at the moment
[unintelligible].

136
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:54,005
Bekah: Oh, that's not fair.
That's cheating [Bekah and

137
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:55,000
Julia laughs] [unintelligible]
all.

138
00:05:56,675 --> 00:05:59,946
Dan: Listen, it's not food.
That's the only -- that was the

139
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:02,706
only rule. All right, fine.

140
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:04,700
Julia: That's time. Time. I
mean, time- time is infinite,

141
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:04,855
Dan [Bekah laughs].

142
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:08,700
Dan: Hmm. But I don't have an
infinite supply of it.

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,700
Bekah: Well --

144
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,300
Dan: See?

145
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:14,185
Bekah: You want free time.
That's what you're asking for.

146
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:16,115
Dan: I want more time.

147
00:06:16,716 --> 00:06:17,776
Julia: You wanna loop forever?

148
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:19,700
Dan: [Laughs] No.

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Bekah: I would hate loop
forever.

150
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,555
Dan: No, that doesn't sound good
either. Yeah, no, no, no.

151
00:06:23,586 --> 00:06:28,956
Alright, fine. How about ... can
I sell the thing? Is it --

152
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:29,521
Julia: Sure.

153
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:31,776
Dan: Can I do ... I mean --

154
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,380
Bekah: No drugs. You can't sell
drugs.

155
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:33,700
Dan: Can I do-

156
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,000
Bekah: Nothing illegal.

157
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,536
Dan: -money? Nothing illegal?
What is this? You're

158
00:06:37,536 --> 00:06:40,000
putting all these rules in that
didn't exist [chuckles].

159
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,700
Bekah: It was in the fine print.

160
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,000
Dan: Bo- gold. One of those
things called ... Doubloons.

161
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yep. That's it.

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,700
Bekah: Doubloons? Like
[inaudible]?

163
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,286
Dan: [Laughs] Like a pirate.
[Julia and Bekah laugh] And then

164
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:55,500
I'll sell 'em when I need more
money and the-

165
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,000
Julia: Why doubl-

166
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Dan: -infinite supply. Yeah
[laughs].

167
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:07,000
Julia: Okay.

168
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Dan: It's the most practical way
to transport gold [laughs].

169
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,300
Bekah: What is happening?

170
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,786
Dan: Yeah. And,

171
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:09,516
you know, I could fill up a pool
and go swimming in it,

172
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:13,326
Scrooge McDuck style. I could
sell them, you know, when I

173
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:18,846
needed more money for things. I
could probably make jewelry out

174
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:23,225
of them — Doubloons, you know?
Is that, you know --

175
00:07:23,255 --> 00:07:25,000
Bekah: Listen. Just for
reference. We are recording this

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,700
on a Thursday at 1.30 Eastern-

177
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:27,995
Dan: Mm-hmm.

178
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,336
Bekah: -in the afternoon. We are
not even like-

179
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:31,625
Julia: No one's --

180
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,500
Bekah: -to a point where we
should be [laughs] having

181
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,700
this conversation.

182
00:07:34,776 --> 00:07:38,105
Dan: I- I went home for lunch
just before this and opened

183
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:41,511
my fridge to get a soda. And
definitely took a hard look at

184
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:46,190
the beer [laughs]. I chose not
to today. But I- I- I was like,

185
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,031
"It's been that kind of week."
I- I- I took a look at it. So I

186
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:51,300
decided to wait to later. But-

187
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:51,500
Julia: Oh, my god.

188
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,120
Dan: -I actually got my first,
like, full night sleep last

189
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,951
night in, I don't know, at least
a week.

190
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:56,975
Bekah: Oh, your brain doesn't
know what to do with itself now.

191
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,700
It's very confused.

192
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:59,000
Dan: I know, I know. I have lots
of energy today, so -- anyway-

193
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,200
Bekah: Doubloons.

194
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,000
Dan: -me and my gold Doubloons
are gonna, you know? That's what

195
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,581
we're gonna do.

196
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:06,466
Bekah: Good luck, Julia. It's
your turn [laughs].

197
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:11,886
Julia: Yeah. I have a lot of
thoughts now. My name's Julia

198
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:19,700
Seidman. I am ... [sigh] I don't
know. I guess I call my --

199
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,555
I -- lately, I've been

200
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:26,235
calling myself a developer
educator. I'm kind of -- mainly,

201
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:34,505
what I do is I work with API
companies to create sample apps,

202
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:38,495
and getting started guides and
tutorials, and generally help

203
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,500
them, like, improve their
developer experience, with

204
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,000
specifically, like, with an eye
towards onboarding new

205
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,775
developers, but

206
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:50,375
also, like, trying to create
content that inspires

207
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:59,750
creativity. So, I write code,
and I write about code, and,

208
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:04,521
yeah. I ... [sigh] if I had an
unlimited supply of something.

209
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:08,571
So

210
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,340
I was gonna say sunscreen
because I compulsively buy

211
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,790
sunscreen,

212
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:21,321
like, in enormous quantities.
Every time I see it, I'm like,

213
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,610
"Oh, I should probably buy more
sunscreen." But I don't ever

214
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:31,250
actually remember to use it. And
I'm imagining that if I had an

215
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,600
unlimited supply that just like
materialized, then maybe I would

216
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:38,841
actually remember to use the
sunblock and I would stop

217
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:41,300
spending so much money on
sunblock-

218
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,500
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

219
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,030
Julia: -that doesn't get used.

220
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:53,405
But, then I thought, there are
rare earth metals that are much

221
00:09:53,405 --> 00:10:55,700
more valuable per ounce than
gold.

222
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,700
Dan: Yeah, but they
[unintelligible] Doubloons.

223
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:56,501
Julia: And if I'm allowed sell
the thing, and

224
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:05,796
especially if I could like have
rare earth metals without the

225
00:10:05,796 --> 00:10:09,605
environmental costs of mining
them, and like, the, like, child

226
00:10:09,605 --> 00:10:11,780
labor costs of mining them, and
all of that, then- then that's

227
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,955
--

228
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:16,700
that -- that'd be really good.
So, I think -- I'm not sure

229
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:23,735
which rare earth metal, I have
to do my research. But some --

230
00:10:23,735 --> 00:10:24,500
yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

231
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,300
Dan: Yes. I thought of another
answer.

232
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,300
Julia: Okay.

233
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,700
Dan: E-energy. That'd be my --
that was my-

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,300
Bekah: Ohh.

235
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,520
Dan: -last one, but, yeah. Cuz I
could sell that too, honestly.

236
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,000
But I could also, you know-

237
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,300
Julia: What?

238
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:35,990
Dan: -power all-

239
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:36,696
Bekah: Whoa. I was thinking-

240
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,541
Dan: -power all my ba- my
battery things.

241
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,700
Bekah: -like, energy to get
through the day. You're

242
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,221
thinking of-

243
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:42,260
Dan: Oh, personal energy? Oh,
no, no, no. I meant, like --

244
00:10:42,346 --> 00:10:42,956
Bekah: -like, solar energy
[laughs].

245
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:43,110
Julia: Like, electricity.

246
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,700
Dan: You -- you'll -- yeah,
well, you know. Not -- don't

247
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,461
have to be

248
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:48,711
electricity. Just energy, you
know? I can convert it into,

249
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:52,821
like, electricity if I want. I
can convert it into ... probably

250
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:53,331
other things.

251
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:54,216
Bekah: To be able to make you
fast [chuckles]?

252
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,931
Dan: Well, no. Probably could
power a thing that, maybe, fast,

253
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:05,000
you know? You know? So, yeah.
That's it- that's it. That's-

254
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,300
Bekah: Alright.

255
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,000
Dan: -that's gotta be the real
answer [chuckles].

256
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,200
Bekah: Excellent.

257
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,490
Dan: I- I- I do wanna know where
these things come

258
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,700
from, you know? Cuz -- because-

259
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,800
Bekah: I wanna know where Julia
gonna support her-

260
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,941
Dan: -it's, like, unlimited
supply.

261
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:17,500
Bekah: -unlimited
[unintelligible].

262
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,700
Dan: Well, is it -- it not -- is
it -- unlimited supply, I

263
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
mean, yeah. Does it mean, like
-- oh, you were asking about

264
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,270
this too? Does it just, like,

265
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,551
one appear when you need it? Or
is it like --

266
00:11:26,326 --> 00:11:27,500
Julia: Yeah. [Unintelligible]-

267
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,700
Dan: I mean it's an -- you know-

268
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Julia: -closet. Every time-

269
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:29,721
Dan: -it has to be like that.

270
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,000
Julia: -I'm looking at
[unintelligible].

271
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:29,806
Dan: Right.

272
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:32,936
Bekah: Yeah. That's what I was
imagining. A closet of

273
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:33,000
[Julia laughs] --

274
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:36,591
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So
they don't -- yes. Nobody's

275
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,000
mining them or- or- or making
this sunblocker-

276
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,300
Julia: Yeah.

277
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:38,750
Dan: -or whatever.

278
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:39,265
Julia: Yeah.

279
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:39,650
Dan: Yeah.

280
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:43,385
Julia: As far as I know,
manufacturing sunblock is not,

281
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:43,806
like-

282
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,931
Dan: We need Kirk on this.

283
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:47,105
Julia: -[inaudible]
environmentally costly, but --

284
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:47,990
Dan: I [inaudible].

285
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:49,500
Bekah: We should -- that should
be our last episode of this

286
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,936
season. Should just be Kirk's
questions that we answer.

287
00:11:55,221 --> 00:11:57,561
Dan: Oh, man. Kirk, if he was
there for that, would just have

288
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,010
an aneurysm, I think, by the end
of it [laughs].

289
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,500
Bekah: [Laughs] So, if you are
listening and you have not

290
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,105
experienced a Kirk question,
when we do these questions

291
00:12:05,105 --> 00:12:06,710
before

292
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:11,120
every Virtual Coffee, Kirk has
been coming up with some-

293
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:16,791
some doozies, I- I guess. You
can label them where it leaves

294
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,145
a lot of room for interpretation
and requires you to think

295
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:21,499
outside

296
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,390
of the box. Which is ... a
rabbit hole for most of us

297
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:26,500
[laughs].

298
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:33,546
Julia: Yeah. I hold a little bit
of blame, potentially. I

299
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:37,115
don't know. In that one time, in
the co-working room, I pulled

300
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:39,000
out a copy of, "Would You
Rather?", questions-

301
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,500
Bekah: Oh, yes.

302
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,275
Julia: -for eight year olds? And

303
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:45,306
there have been a few that were
inspired by "Would You Rather?

304
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,235
For 8 Year Olds".

305
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,500
Bekah: Is that a book?

306
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:49,625
Julia: It's a book.

307
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,841
Bekah: Oh, oh.

308
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:51,350
Dan: Mm.

309
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:54,700
Julia: They have them -- one for
seven year olds, eight year

310
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,300
olds, nine year olds.

311
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:56,700
Bekah: Oh.

312
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,706
Julia: I don't know what the
difference is, but --

313
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:00,201
Bekah: My-

314
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:01,130
Dan: I'm writing that down.

315
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,245
Bekah: -kid has a birthday in a
couple weeks. He's about to be

316
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:07,300
eight, and he would love that.
So I guess, don't -- this will

317
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,535
come out

318
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:11,765
after his birthday. So in case
he listens, it will not be

319
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:15,995
spoiled.

320
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,135
Julia: [Laughs] Right. Your kids
[inaudible].

321
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:20,800
Bekah: I think this is the
record for our longest intro

322
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:20,975
ever [laughs].

323
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:22,446
Julia: [Laughs] Sorry.

324
00:13:23,196 --> 00:13:26,316
Bekah: No, don't be sorry. It
was all Dan's fault.

325
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,260
Dan: No. No.

326
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,931
Julia: I even held back on a
story about gold doubloons.

327
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:34,700
Bekah: [Laughs] We -- you have a
story about gold Doubloons?

328
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:34,740
Dan: Oh, now I wanna hear it
[laughs].

329
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,200
Bekah: Yeah!

330
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,640
Julia: Well, it's not about gold
Doubloons. It's about gold

331
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,000
Krugerrands, which --

332
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,700
Dan: Wait. What are those?

333
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,941
Julia: It -- so it was the
currency in South Africa. Like

334
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:49,250
... I don't know. Historically,
I'm not sure when they stopped

335
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:54,700
using them. But they are ... I
guess, they- [sigh] they were

336
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,941
kinda popular

337
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:02,030
among, like, people doing, like,
black market kind of stuff,

338
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:10,880
pre-internet age. And we had a
super corrupt governor in

339
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,801
Connecticut when I was growing
up named John Rowland. And one

340
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:18,561
of  -- John Rowland had like a
couple of cronies in my

341
00:14:18,561 --> 00:14:21,321
hometown.

342
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:28,000
And one of his ... I don't know.
Partners in crime-

343
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:28,700
Dan: Mm-hmm.

344
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,721
Julia: -was the father

345
00:14:29,721 --> 00:14:34,100
of one of my sister's
classmates. And he- he was

346
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,479
arrested

347
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:46,221
while my sister was in high
school. And I -- in my mind,

348
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:51,331
they actually caught him in the
act of burying gold Krugerrands

349
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,740
in his backyard. I don't know
that they actually caught him in

350
00:14:54,745 --> 00:14:56,858
the act. But, for sure, my
sister went to high school with

351
00:14:56,858 --> 00:14:58,971
someone

352
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,921
who was -- whose father was
arrested and found to have

353
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,990
hundreds of thousands of dollars
of, like, illegal South African

354
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,510
gold coins buried in his
backyard. So --

355
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:16,500
Dan: [Chuckles] Ah, that is
incredible. I like that.

356
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Julia: It is. Really bizarre
[laughs].

357
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,326
Dan: This is what I'm talking
about. It's so much of a

358
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:21,725
better story than if you just
had, like, cash buried in his

359
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:22,086
backyard, you know?

360
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:23,000
Julia: Oh, totally. Well, there
was-

361
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,300
Dan: Yeah.

362
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,700
Julia: -that guy from Louisiana
who had cash in his freezer.

363
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,015
This guy, way more [inaudible].

364
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:32,000
Dan: [Inaudible] one and a half
inches -- yeah, they're like

365
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,395
this quarter. Like, a little

366
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:35,375
bit bigger than an American
quarter, I suppose.

367
00:15:35,706 --> 00:15:36,515
Julia: Are you looking it up?

368
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:40,115
Dan: I'm looking at 'em on
Wikipedia. So, by 1980, they

369
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:43,700
accounted for more than 90% of
the global coin market.

370
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:43,895
Julia: Wow.

371
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:45,700
Dan: And was the number one
choice for investors buying

372
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:45,846
gold.

373
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:47,885
Julia: Yeah.

374
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:51,015
Dan: Yeah, yeah. They're not the
[unintelligible].

375
00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:51,756
Julia: They're more like
[inaudible] untraceable-

376
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,500
Dan: Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

377
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,956
Julia: -you know? I dunno.
Anyway --

378
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,015
Bekah: This is where we need
sound effects. For like,

379
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:58,025
"[Singing] The more you know."
Is that how it goes [laughs]?

380
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:01,416
Dan: [Chuckles] Oh, yeah.
Uh-huh.

381
00:16:02,946 --> 00:16:03,125
Bekah: We weren't --

382
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:04,000
Dan: Well, I don't have that
one. All I have is

383
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,596
[winning sound effect plays].

384
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:06,336
Bekah: That is --

385
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:07,206
Dan: That's all I've got
[laughs].

386
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:11,466
Bekah: Not- not what we're --
not the vibe I was going for

387
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:12,000
[laughs].

388
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,300
Dan: Alright. So, these are
cool. But, yeah. Doubloons, I

389
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,900
feel like I need them to be
bigger and- and thicker, you

390
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,056
know?

391
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:19,806
Bekah: So you can get all of
them?

392
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,000
Dan: You know what I mean? Why,
you could wear 'em, you could

393
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,096
do, you know, I -- you what I
mean?

394
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:25,500
Julia: Well, I mean, the
Krugerrands, like, they're a lot

395
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,214
more portable than like a big
brick.

396
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:30,673
Dan: Oh, I get it. I mean, I
understand practically, like,

397
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:32,474
these are good for crime and
stuff, you know? [Inaudible].

398
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:33,729
Bekah: These are good for crime
[laughs]?

399
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,500
Dan: I'm saying, for my thing
[chuckles], you know, this is

400
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,083
why I want- I want -- if I have
an unlimited supply,

401
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,083
I'd might rather just, you know?
You know what I mean?

402
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:44,443
If I change my late -- mind
later, I can just melt 'em down

403
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:46,000
and make Krugerrands with them
[laughs].

404
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Julia: True. True.

405
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,000
Dan: Yeah, alright.

406
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,200
Bekah: Okay.

407
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,700
Dan: Well, that was our podcast
[all laugh]. Thanks for coming,

408
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,000
Julia [laughs].

409
00:16:57,089 --> 00:16:58,739
Bekah: I'm gonna -- there's no
segue here. So, thanks for

410
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:00,389
coming

411
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:05,249
on the podcast, Julia. We like
to get started with your origin

412
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:08,969
story. And maybe that's where it
starts, with gold coins and

413
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:14,000
backyards. But [Julia laughs]
give us your- your story of how

414
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,078
you came to this point in your
tech journey.

415
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:24,959
Julia: I wish. If only. So, I- I
-- when I was in college, I --

416
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:31,679
well, so, when I was in college,
I double majored in

417
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:38,009
anthropology and comparative
religion, which is not useful

418
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:44,638
in any commonly known sense of
the word. But I had a- I had

419
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:50,500
a- a dean who I knew pre -- she
was actually -- well, anyway.

420
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:50,729
I knew

421
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:52,648
her pretty well, and we were
talking one time, and she said

422
00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:54,823
something about how she had had
a car- she had decided to

423
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,998
embrace

424
00:17:57,003 --> 00:18:04,108
the careen over the career. And
I just really liked that phrase

425
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:10,000
and idea, like -- and- and I
would say that that's kind of

426
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,814
what I

427
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:17,773
aspire to, is, like, I- I can't
plan. I'm no good at committing

428
00:18:17,923 --> 00:18:23,700
to any- [laughs] any, like, long
term vision, but what I am good

429
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,344
at is rolling with the

430
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:29,834
punches and, like, just kinda
seeing where things go. So,

431
00:18:31,423 --> 00:18:37,153
after college, I bounced around
for a few years, working in --

432
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:44,223
as a professional fundraiser, as
an events coordinator, really

433
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:53,653
briefly, as a recruiter. And
then, I spent like about four

434
00:18:53,653 --> 00:18:58,544
years working in finance, which
was just a total -- like, I

435
00:18:58,544 --> 00:19:02,084
just stumbled into the job. They
had hired somebody else who went

436
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:04,439
to the same college and they
were like, "Huh, let's hire her.

437
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:06,794
Let's

438
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:08,000
see how it goes." And-

439
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,300
Dan: Mm-hmm.

440
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:15,284
Julia: -I -- so, I really liked
it in some ways.

441
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:20,000
I really liked that -- the sort
of -- the analytical work, I

442
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,500
liked that I was learning a lot
because I had no background in

443
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,044
finance. I

444
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:30,464
did a lot of writing while I was
there. And if I kind of look

445
00:19:30,464 --> 00:19:33,884
back

446
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:38,000
at, like, what's the theme, in
my- [chuckles] in my careen --

447
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,763
what I would say is

448
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:45,554
that I -- what I- what I do,
over the long arc, I learn about

449
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:50,173
things, and then I write about
them. So, at that phase, I was

450
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:52,513
learning about finance and
writing about finance,

451
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:58,364
simultaneously. And that was
great for a few years. But

452
00:19:58,368 --> 00:20:02,550
then in 2000, fall of 2008,
winter of 2009, I don't

453
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,732
remember.

454
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:11,054
I- I don't know if other people
remember this time as acutely as

455
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:16,963
I do. I live in Seattle, WAMU
collapsed. I worked in finance,

456
00:20:16,993 --> 00:20:20,233
everything else collapsed. We
had people being taken to the ER

457
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:23,473
in

458
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,453
the middle of the work day
because they thought they were

459
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:29,443
having heart attacks, but it was
actually just panic attacks.

460
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:33,733
It was such an intensely
stressful time that I was like,

461
00:20:34,423 --> 00:20:38,500
"Peace. I am- I am out here
[laughs]." I do not wanna work

462
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,284
in this world

463
00:20:39,284 --> 00:20:46,634
anymore. No one is happy. And
so, I did -- I went back to

464
00:20:46,634 --> 00:20:48,913
school and did something that
was probably as far in the

465
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:51,192
opposite

466
00:20:51,193 --> 00:20:54,253
direction as you could go. And I
became a high school English

467
00:20:54,253 --> 00:21:06,673
teacher. I did that for about 10
years. And then just

468
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:15,374
kind of got exhausted by the ...
I don't know. The vagaries of

469
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:22,124
working in public education. And
it -- oh. It's another story for

470
00:21:22,124 --> 00:21:27,673
another day, but I worked at a
very high pressure, in a ve-

471
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,000
high income, high pressure
community. And, I was really not

472
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,700
... happy with, like, the way
that my students lives were

473
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,763
being shaped.

474
00:21:42,673 --> 00:21:50,054
So, when my second child was
born, I was like, "You know, I'm

475
00:21:50,054 --> 00:21:52,800
gonna take a break." And I took
a year off, and it felt really

476
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:52,963
good.

477
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:57,104
And so, I took another year off.
And during that second year, I

478
00:21:57,104 --> 00:22:02,804
started learning how to code. I
started kind of more with data

479
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:08,953
science because of having that
finance background. But along

480
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:13,034
the way, kinda stumbled my way
through various things. And I

481
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:16,814
did a bootcamp, I did some
self-taught stuff, I did some

482
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:26,953
internships, I did a -- an kind
of incubator program. And

483
00:22:26,953 --> 00:22:32,233
then stumbled my way once again
into this role that I'm in now,

484
00:22:32,624 --> 00:22:38,263
doing developer education. So,
once again, I'm learning about

485
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:42,700
things, and then I'm writing
about them. So, yeah. that's-

486
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:48,000
that's my origin story. And I
think it's good because I

487
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,568
finally found

488
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:51,628
something where, like, there's
really no limit on how much I

489
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:59,398
can learn. And I have a ton of
control over who I work with,

490
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:04,000
and when I work, and all of
that. And the people that I am

491
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,700
teaching through my work, really
wanna learn [chuckles]. They are

492
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
intrinsically motivated and
that's- that's cool. Yeah. So,

493
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,269
that's me.

494
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,479
Bekah: Yeah. That makes such a
difference when people are

495
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:20,519
motivated to learn.

496
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:25,000
Julia: It's huge. [Laughs] It's
huge. And, like, you get that

497
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,288
sometimes in K-12

498
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:32,818
education, right? Like, I'm -- I
don't know. I'm sure we all had

499
00:23:32,824 --> 00:23:38,489
times in our education where we
were really genuinely motivated

500
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:44,000
by something, but there's just
so much else going on that ...

501
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I- I don't know.

502
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,300
Bekah: Yeah.

503
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,398
Julia: I don't love it.

504
00:23:48,148 --> 00:23:50,819
Bekah: Right. Right. That's -- I
mean, I -- my background's in

505
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:54,959
education. I taught college
English for 10 years. And it was

506
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:59,500
a lot of core classes, which
means people had to take those

507
00:23:59,500 --> 00:23:59,669
classes.

508
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:00,000
Julia: Yeah.

509
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,878
Bekah: It wasn't an option. Most
of them did not wanna be there,

510
00:24:02,884 --> 00:24:05,500
didn't see the point of it,
weren't motivated. And, like, to

511
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,500
the point of being aggressively
unmotivated and, like angry-

512
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,000
Julia: Oh, yeah.

513
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,300
Bekah: -about things. I'm like,
"This is not- not why I signed-

514
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:15,500
Julia: [Laughs] No.

515
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,300
Bekah: -up to teach."

516
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,500
Julia: No.

517
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,923
Bekah: And, like, the rare
occasion, I

518
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:22,153
would be able to teach a, like,
a special interest class. I

519
00:24:22,153 --> 00:24:25,000
taught a screenwriting class
once. I had eight or 10

520
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,874
students. It

521
00:24:25,874 --> 00:24:29,023
was the best experience. I loved
that. Because everybody was

522
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:32,953
excited about being there and
talking about those things.

523
00:24:32,953 --> 00:24:33,074
Julia: Yeah.

524
00:24:33,074 --> 00:24:37,273
Bekah: But those experiences are
... not as frequent [chuckles].

525
00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:41,000
Julia: No. Nope. No, they're
not.

526
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,300
Bekah: Yeah.

527
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,909
Julia: And yet -- I- I mean, the
people who

528
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,798
stick with it and do it for a
long time and -- I mean, I have

529
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:58,709
enormous respect, but I also
don't at all judge anyone who

530
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:02,368
opts out because it can be
pretty demoralizing.

531
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:05,173
Bekah: Yeah. And I think that —
I don't know if it's a

532
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:06,972
generational

533
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:10,094
thing or not — but I know my
parents stayed in careers

534
00:25:10,098 --> 00:25:16,094
forever. And a lot of the people
around us, who are in the

535
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:17,773
same generation, they spent
their entire careers, you know,

536
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:19,452
doing

537
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:24,433
one thing. But I see more people
now — maybe just cuz I'm older —

538
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:27,300
changing careers and it-

539
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:27,500
Julia: Yeah.

540
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,374
Bekah: - in, like, not having to
be stuck doing something that

541
00:25:30,374 --> 00:25:32,879
you're not interested in doing
is really important to me. So, I

542
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:35,384
know,

543
00:25:35,384 --> 00:25:36,808
like, I would talk to somebody
else about a career in tech and

544
00:25:36,808 --> 00:25:38,232
I

545
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:39,721
was like, "I don't know if I'll
be here five years or not." She

546
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:41,203
-- she's

547
00:25:41,203 --> 00:25:43,334
the same thing. Like, "Yeah, I
don't know if I will either. I

548
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:47,834
kinda hope I'm not." Like, there
are lots of options out there in

549
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:50,204
finding, exploring those things
that keep you interested, I

550
00:25:50,204 --> 00:25:52,574
think

551
00:25:52,578 --> 00:25:55,933
helps you to, I dunno, be
motivated in all areas of your

552
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:56,203
life.

553
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,638
Julia: Uh-huh. Yeah. And that's
something, like, when I kinda

554
00:25:59,638 --> 00:26:04,499
made the transition into tech, I
was pretty explicit in saying

555
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:09,328
like, "It's not that I think I'm
gonna be writing code all day,

556
00:26:09,328 --> 00:26:16,269
every day, for the rest of my
life. This is a skill --

557
00:26:18,403 --> 00:26:24,584
it's a skill and like a
discipline that can feed other

558
00:26:24,673 --> 00:26:25,700
kinds of growth-

559
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,200
Bekah: Yes.

560
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:31,000
Julia: -that can enable me to
get involved in- in different

561
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,203
things. And I- I think,
initially, I thought of it more

562
00:26:35,203 --> 00:26:38,864
as a skill. And now, I would say
it's really is more of like a

563
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:46,000
discipline. Like, there's not
one skill that- that anybody

564
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
learns, except maybe -- and- and
I think that thi-thi-this is

565
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,163
part of like what

566
00:26:54,163 --> 00:26:59,534
has helped make me successful in
the time that I've been working

567
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:05,324
in tech? Maybe the skill is just
learning how to learn.

568
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:05,500
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

569
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:09,700
Julia: Like -- and I think that
that's, like, if I [laughs] --

570
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,963
kinda what I'm good at.

571
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:14,324
Like, I'm good at learning about
stuff. And that's, I think,

572
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:18,689
probably the most essential
skill. Otherwise, like, it's

573
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:21,929
not, like, you could say like,
"Oh, I have a skill in writing

574
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:27,719
JavaScript." Like, that's not --
I mean, that is skill, but it

575
00:27:27,723 --> 00:27:34,019
changes. And, really, the skill
isn't ab- is about, like, habits

576
00:27:34,023 --> 00:27:37,739
of mind and ... I don't know.

577
00:27:40,574 --> 00:27:44,400
Bekah: Yeah. I love that. And I
think, I- I also always struggle

578
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:44,503
with

579
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:47,953
people asking me what my career
goals are. And I think, that's,

580
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:51,163
for like a lot of this reason, I
don't really have career goals.

581
00:27:51,163 --> 00:27:54,200
Like, I'm interested in, you
know, connecting other people.

582
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,403
And like

583
00:27:54,403 --> 00:27:57,824
you said, like, learning new
things. And so, for me, it's not

584
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:01,814
like, "Oh, I wanna be a senior
blah, blah, blah, someday," you

585
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:05,683
know? I just wanna keep doing
things that I'm interested in

586
00:28:05,713 --> 00:28:10,300
and helping to support other
people, you know, feel part of

587
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:10,483
something.

588
00:28:10,729 --> 00:28:15,929
Julia: Mm-hmm. I mean, I think
it's cool when people have those

589
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:17,368
aspirations to --

590
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:21,500
Bekah: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think
that's totally fine. I just

591
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:21,733
think that

592
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,728
there are so many different
career paths and ways to

593
00:28:23,728 --> 00:28:25,723
approach

594
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:27,766
what you're doing. That, like,
acknowledging that I'm

595
00:28:27,766 --> 00:28:29,803
interested

596
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:33,000
in learning or learning new
things now. That's a really

597
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,824
great place to be too.

598
00:28:34,598 --> 00:28:36,088
Julia: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

599
00:28:37,108 --> 00:28:40,318
Bekah: So, let's back up a
little bit and talk about what

600
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:42,689
your work, what you do for work.

601
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:43,479
Julia: Sure.

602
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:50,548
Bekah: Just to give, like, more
of a zoomed in idea of what

603
00:28:50,548 --> 00:28:54,500
you're doing daily, or, you
know, how the projects get

604
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,229
chosen that

605
00:28:55,229 --> 00:28:58,199
you're working on, and talk
through some other things that

606
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:59,939
you like about that.

607
00:29:00,383 --> 00:29:03,144
Julia: Okay. So I'll just talk
about what I'm working on right

608
00:29:03,144 --> 00:29:07,763
now, cuz I think that's a good
sort of snapshot. Right now, I

609
00:29:07,763 --> 00:29:12,144
have three main projects that
I'm working on. Three different

610
00:29:12,144 --> 00:29:21,173
clients, three different sort of
types of work. One is

611
00:29:21,203 --> 00:29:28,554
like an API tooling company, and
I am a frequent contributor

612
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:36,054
to their technical blog. So I
just wrote a three part series

613
00:29:37,074 --> 00:29:39,500
on authentication and --
authorization and an

614
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
authentication best practices

615
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,953
for APIs. So, I'm not writing
code when I'm doing that,

616
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:51,324
but I'm doing a lot of in depth
technical research, reading

617
00:29:51,324 --> 00:29:57,068
code, reading, you know, reading
documentation from different ...

618
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:02,754
I don't know. Different
solutions providers. I did an

619
00:30:02,754 --> 00:30:05,769
SME

620
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,318
interview as part of that with a
senior engineer who oversees

621
00:30:08,318 --> 00:30:10,748
some

622
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:16,929
of their security stuff at- at
that -- at my client company.

623
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:21,669
And then writing those articles,
like, for a technical audience.

624
00:30:21,673 --> 00:30:26,000
Writing for API developers to
say, like, "Here's how to

625
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,300
approach the decision making
process." And that was one of

626
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,598
the things that I

627
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:35,979
try to do as a writer and like,
part of why they keep bringing

628
00:30:35,979 --> 00:30:41,000
me back there [chuckles] is that
there's a lot of repetitive

629
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,759
content out there.

630
00:30:43,838 --> 00:30:48,429
So, if you look up like API
security best practices, you're

631
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,824
gonna see a lot of articles that
say, essentially, the same

632
00:30:49,824 --> 00:30:51,219
thing.

633
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:58,000
Anytime you look up anything to
do with GWT -- JaWTs- JaWTs —

634
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
j- JSON Web Tokens [chuckles],

635
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,439
the first hits are the same.
Like, it's -- everything

636
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:15,909
is so SEO optimized, like -- and
what I try to do is to take a- a

637
00:31:15,913 --> 00:31:19,659
point of view that's a little
bit more about like, "Okay,

638
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:21,684
there's a lot of options.
There's not a best option. How

639
00:31:21,684 --> 00:31:23,709
do we come

640
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:27,098
up with a decision making
framework?" Like, how do you, as

641
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:29,078
a developer, as a, you know, as
a team lead, a product

642
00:31:29,078 --> 00:31:31,058
architect,

643
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:33,248
whatever, how do you approach
the decision making process of

644
00:31:33,248 --> 00:31:35,438
like,

645
00:31:35,469 --> 00:31:41,919
"What's the best option for me?"
So, that's kinda part of

646
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,398
what that series is about, and
I've done things like that on

647
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:51,278
other aspects of API design for
them. So that's one thing and

648
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:56,229
that's kind of the least
technical part of what I do.

649
00:31:57,578 --> 00:32:04,179
Then, right now, I'm working
with two other clients. One is

650
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:16,298
they have a GraphQL API that
coordinates the APIs for like,

651
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:20,858
maybe, I don't know. Just
estimating 40 different brands

652
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:27,700
of IoT devices. So, like, your
Schlage smart locks, or your

653
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,628
Phillips hue

654
00:32:28,634 --> 00:32:33,999
light bulbs, or your ecobee
thermostat, or whatever, each of

655
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:37,351
those has its own API and its
own app. And as a homeowner, you

656
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:40,703
can

657
00:32:40,703 --> 00:32:44,648
use like Google Home or
whatever. But let's say that you

658
00:32:44,648 --> 00:32:48,593
were,

659
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:52,584
like, an apartment building
superintendent and you wanted to

660
00:32:52,584 --> 00:32:56,213
be able to manage all of the
smart devices in your buildings

661
00:32:57,114 --> 00:33:03,054
from one place instead of all of
those places, they make an API

662
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:09,594
that coordinates all of those
things. And so, I -- but right

663
00:33:09,594 --> 00:33:15,000
now, most of their documentation
is very, like, marketing-

664
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,300
Bekah: Mm.

665
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,000
Julia: -oriented. They --

666
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,009
it's, like, they've been very
focused on just like onboarding

667
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:26,888
their first few significant
customers. And the -- and their

668
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:31,598
technical onboarding has been
like super intensive, custom,

669
00:33:31,598 --> 00:33:33,638
like, hand holding. And I --
we're -- I'm involved in helping

670
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:35,678
to

671
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:41,378
transition them away from that,
like, creating more standard

672
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:44,033
documentation for like those
getting started guides. So, how

673
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:46,627
to

674
00:33:46,628 --> 00:33:51,338
build a Node app that allows you
to control all of your smart

675
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:55,209
locks. How to build an, you
know, and then, eventually, like

676
00:33:55,598 --> 00:33:58,358
integrating all of these
different things in there. But

677
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:03,849
also, along the way, explaining
like, "Why is this a GraphQL API

678
00:34:04,388 --> 00:34:11,498
instead of REST? Why do we
insist on you using a specific

679
00:34:11,503 --> 00:34:18,068
authentication protocol?" And-
and there are technical reasons

680
00:34:18,068 --> 00:34:19,643
that they do all of those things
that have to do with

681
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:21,218
coordinating

682
00:34:21,224 --> 00:34:24,416
between 40 different APIs. So,
the content that I'm creating

683
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:27,608
for

684
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:29,888
them, some of it is just
creating these sample apps and

685
00:34:29,888 --> 00:34:32,168
kind of

686
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:37,659
documenting the nitty-gritty of
those apps. And then, some of

687
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:44,918
it is the more in depth
explanations of, like, wha- the

688
00:34:44,923 --> 00:34:49,989
why, of how it works. And that's
been really cool because I've

689
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,500
gotten to learn a lot about-

690
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:51,700
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

691
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,969
Julia: -these different aspects
of it. Plus, I

692
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:57,091
think IoT is really interesting.
We have -- everything in our

693
00:34:57,091 --> 00:34:59,213
house

694
00:34:59,213 --> 00:35:03,500
is smart -- is like a smart
device. And it frustrates me

695
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,500
that they don't talk to each
other very well [chuckles].

696
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:06,700
Bekah: Yeah.

697
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,300
Julia: And --

698
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:07,500
Dan: Mm-hmm.

699
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,423
Julia: [Laughs] It's ... yeah, I

700
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:14,543
think it's cool. I just -- it's
a really exciting, interesting

701
00:35:14,543 --> 00:35:18,563
project to be working on. And
the engineers who work at this

702
00:35:18,563 --> 00:35:20,843
company are, like, they are --
they know their stuff. Like,

703
00:35:20,843 --> 00:35:23,123
they are

704
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:31,523
very smart people. Cr- creative,
analytical people. So it's been

705
00:35:31,523 --> 00:35:37,500
really neat working with them.
And then my other client

706
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:37,643
[laughs] that I'm

707
00:35:37,643 --> 00:35:40,088
working on right now -- working
with right now, this one is,

708
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:42,533
like,

709
00:35:43,253 --> 00:35:45,278
simultaneously an example of
what I do and really, really,

710
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:47,303
really

711
00:35:47,304 --> 00:35:52,554
do not like about my current
role. So this is a company who

712
00:35:52,554 --> 00:36:01,494
makes a player engagement API
for game developers. So, you

713
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:06,023
know, sending push notifications
and rewards, you know, in game

714
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:16,793
... stuff. And I'm creating a
lot of the same kind of like

715
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:25,974
getting started guides. Because,
again, like, they -- their

716
00:36:26,403 --> 00:36:29,034
existing documentation sort of
assumes that you already know

717
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:31,271
what this thing does and,
roughly, how to use it. Like,

718
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:33,503
maybe you've

719
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:35,186
already been using a competitor
product and you're just

720
00:36:35,186 --> 00:36:36,863
switching

721
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:39,008
over. And so, it's- it's not
gonna be any challenge to -- but

722
00:36:39,008 --> 00:36:41,152
they're

723
00:36:41,153 --> 00:36:43,763
hoping to expand and- and kind
of make themselves more

724
00:36:43,763 --> 00:36:46,373
accessible

725
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:55,509
to a broader audience of game
developers. So, to do this,

726
00:36:55,628 --> 00:37:01,500
to create the content that they
want [chuckles], I have had to

727
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:07,298
learn how to work with game
code. And-

728
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:08,139
Bekah: Ooh, right.

729
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:14,300
Julia: -I -- it's just, it's not
all the same [chuckles]. It's

730
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:14,498
like, the

731
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:19,809
transition from working with a
REST API to a GraphQL API in

732
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:24,668
Node is no big deal, right? The
transition from working with one

733
00:37:24,668 --> 00:37:29,599
authentication protocol to
another in .NET is no big deal.

734
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:35,409
But changing this entire
framework and way of thinking

735
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:40,688
about project architecture has
been really, really difficult

736
00:37:40,688 --> 00:37:44,723
for me. And it's just not easy
to troubleshoot and it's ...

737
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:48,758
yeah.

738
00:37:48,818 --> 00:37:52,599
It's been interesting. I mean,
it's cool to be learning and

739
00:37:52,599 --> 00:38:02,199
working on- on something so
radically different. And I hope,

740
00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:03,999
eventually, I'll be able to
create some content for them

741
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:05,739
that's

742
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:11,648
useful and meaningful, but it is
definitely something where

743
00:38:11,648 --> 00:38:15,369
I'm like, "Oh, there has gotta
be somebody else out there who's

744
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:23,500
better qualified to do this.
[Laughs] It's sure not me. But

745
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:23,858
it's kind of

746
00:38:23,858 --> 00:38:26,700
the nature of like, there are
just -- there aren't an enormous

747
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:32,918
number of companies that do what
our company does. And I'm -- I'm

748
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:35,604
technically a freelancer, but I
-- almost all my work right now

749
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,989
is

750
00:38:37,994 --> 00:38:41,349
through- is through an agency.
And there just aren't that many

751
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:44,108
agencies that do what we do. And
we had a sales guy for a little

752
00:38:44,108 --> 00:38:47,746
whi- while who was maybe
overselling [laughs] our

753
00:38:47,746 --> 00:38:51,384
technical

754
00:38:51,384 --> 00:38:54,399
expertise or, like, overselling
the idea that, you know,

755
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:57,414
developers

756
00:38:57,414 --> 00:39:04,000
could learn anything and, you
know, in no time flat

757
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,253
[laughs]. Yeah.

758
00:39:07,373 --> 00:39:12,204
Yeah. But -- so, that -- that's
the kind of thing, like, a --

759
00:39:12,204 --> 00:39:13,704
I'm -- I don't know. Does that
answer? Is that a good answer?

760
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,280
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah, this is
great. I mean, you really broke

761
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,642
down a lot

762
00:39:16,643 --> 00:39:20,063
of different things. Do you get
to choose the projects and the

763
00:39:20,063 --> 00:39:22,500
companies that you work with or
does the agency-

764
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:22,700
Julia: Hmm.

765
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,934
Bekah: -assign you?

766
00:39:24,744 --> 00:39:30,143
Julia: So, when I first started
working with them, it was really

767
00:39:30,143 --> 00:39:38,304
just like, kind of one off
freelance stuff. And over the

768
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,863
course of a couple years --
well, over the course of a year,

769
00:39:40,863 --> 00:39:43,417
you

770
00:39:43,418 --> 00:39:45,023
know, I- I took on a variety of
different projects. And at

771
00:39:45,023 --> 00:39:46,628
first,

772
00:39:46,628 --> 00:39:48,833
they were like pretty targeted
to stuff I already knew and

773
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:51,038
stuff I

774
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,009
had already worked on. And then,
gradually, they started kinda

775
00:39:54,014 --> 00:39:56,018
pulling me in on more stuff and
saying, "Hey, would you be

776
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,389
interested in this? Would you be
interested in this?" And

777
00:39:59,259 --> 00:40:01,493
eventually, I think that they
realized like, "Oh, hey. Julia

778
00:40:01,493 --> 00:40:03,727
is

779
00:40:03,728 --> 00:40:07,329
a person who is happy to learn
new stuff, happy to take on

780
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:15,128
challenging clients." So, I --
I'm now -- like, I'm a 1099, but

781
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:19,223
I'm- I'm the staff writer at- at
the agency. And, I mean, I kind

782
00:40:19,223 --> 00:40:23,318
of

783
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:31,688
get the clients that ... are too
difficult to give to one of our

784
00:40:31,688 --> 00:40:35,213
freelancers. So, like, I kinda
get to choose. I was -- you

785
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:38,738
know,

786
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:40,700
at some point, they asked me
like, "Hey, would you wanna work

787
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:45,500
on this crypto thing?" And I was
like,"No [laughs], not really."

788
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,389
So, I mean, I do get

789
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:50,199
some input. And that first
client that I was talking about,

790
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:55,539
is one where I did a few pieces
for them, they really liked it.

791
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:58,300
I was in some meetings with
them. I really liked them. And

792
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,300
so, I've gotten -- I've been
able to say, "Hey, I-

793
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:01,500
Bekah: Yeah.

794
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,708
Julia: -really like working with

795
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:08,438
them." Like, "I've got ideas.
Let me -- let -- can, you know,

796
00:41:08,438 --> 00:41:12,100
can I take on more of that
relationship?" But, yeah. I

797
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,369
dunno [laughs].

798
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:13,700
Bekah: So, so with-

799
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,000
Dan: That's awesome.

800
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Bekah: -the ideas, do they come
in -- does the company come in

801
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,989
with ideas or they have, like, a
general -- do you define --

802
00:41:23,409 --> 00:41:28,500
Julia: So we- we do our- our --
I have a fly in here. Go away.

803
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,728
Our principal

804
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:38,003
consultant, when- when we
onboard a new client, does a

805
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:42,384
process that they call the- the
dis- the developer content

806
00:41:43,853 --> 00:41:48,293
action plan. So they do like a
developer content review where

807
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:53,500
they say like, "Here are the
gaps in your existing

808
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:53,664
documentation.

809
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:59,483
This is what developers want to
see. This is, you know, this is

810
00:42:00,324 --> 00:42:02,700
-- these are your areas of
strength." And- and they have --

811
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,864
we have kind of a,

812
00:42:03,923 --> 00:42:08,844
you know, a rubric. And then
they come up with a -- an action

813
00:42:08,844 --> 00:42:14,693
plan based on that content gap
analysis. So, it's a

814
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:21,700
collaborative process for sure.
And the longer I've been with

815
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,284
the agency,

816
00:42:22,284 --> 00:42:26,994
like, the more I've been able to
be involved in that process.

817
00:42:28,193 --> 00:42:34,943
Yeah. So it- it's a mix, right?
Sometimes clients have wacky

818
00:42:34,943 --> 00:42:38,844
ideas about what they want. And
then we have some clients

819
00:42:38,844 --> 00:42:44,664
who've been clients for a long
time where we've moved past,

820
00:42:44,664 --> 00:42:47,700
like, that content gap, and it's
more like, "Hey, we would love

821
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,594
to have,

822
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:53,693
you know, this more kinda off
the wall piece. Like, I did a

823
00:42:53,693 --> 00:42:58,554
piece for Algolia around Black
Friday last year. That was like

824
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:03,744
an instant inventory. It was
like, how can you use Algolia

825
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:06,000
to, like, manage your Black
Friday sales?

826
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:06,700
Dan: Yeah.

827
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,614
Julia: And they said, "You know,
this is something we think

828
00:43:07,614 --> 00:43:12,000
we'll, like, kinda republish
every year leading up to Black

829
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,500
Friday."

830
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,500
Bekah: That's awesome.

831
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,043
Julia: So, you know, it- it's
like that

832
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:21,023
kind of thing where it's more
like ... I don't know.

833
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:22,700
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah.

834
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,300
Julia: Creative.

835
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,739
Bekah: That's fun. What? Okay.
So, you've done -- [chuckles]

836
00:43:26,949 --> 00:43:29,619
you've really broken down a lot
of the- the stuff that I was

837
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:31,748
interested in hearing about,
which is great. Like, there are

838
00:43:31,748 --> 00:43:37,119
some really fun parts. There are
some parts that are not so fun

839
00:43:37,123 --> 00:43:43,500
or kind of challenging. Are --
is there [laughs] any -- so, I

840
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,648
would say, it sounds

841
00:43:44,648 --> 00:43:48,188
like the part that you like the
most is being able to learn new

842
00:43:48,188 --> 00:43:52,224
things. But it also seems pretty
fun to be able to develop those

843
00:43:52,224 --> 00:43:54,954
deeper relationships with the
clients too. Is that --

844
00:43:54,954 --> 00:44:03,000
Julia: Absolutely. Yeah. And I-
[exhales] I really -- I like

845
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,679
... that I've been able to

846
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:09,009
recently kind of develop these
more in depth relationships with

847
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:16,869
clients. It's a mixed bag
though, because the consultant

848
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:20,498
client relationship is ... as
I'm sure you both know, not

849
00:44:20,498 --> 00:44:24,127
always

850
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:32,018
the easiest relationship to
navigate. And as a contractor

851
00:44:32,018 --> 00:44:37,599
with my agency, like, I'm always
kind of -- I, like, a little on

852
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,800
guard about, like -- oh, my god.
I -- I'm not even an employee of

853
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,500
this company exactly [laughs].

854
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,918
Like, if I say the wrong thing
and like, upset this client,

855
00:44:47,949 --> 00:44:53,648
like, "Aah," you know? It's my
butt on the line. And our- our

856
00:44:53,648 --> 00:45:00,438
principal consultant is like an
amazing guy. But it's just not-

857
00:45:00,528 --> 00:45:07,143
it's not the same as like being
part of the same team, like,

858
00:45:07,143 --> 00:45:11,600
that manager relationship where
like- like, I don't know. I

859
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:11,764
just --

860
00:45:12,664 --> 00:45:16,414
there's always this, like, added
level of stress in conversations

861
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:19,393
with clients where I'm like,
"Oh, I really hope I don't say

862
00:45:19,393 --> 00:45:27,300
the wrong thing [laughs]." But
[deep exhales] I do like it, and

863
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,500
I think that, like,

864
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:37,773
whatever the next move is in my
careen, I- I wanna have it be

865
00:45:37,773 --> 00:45:41,884
something where I have more
depth-

866
00:45:42,528 --> 00:45:42,648
Bekah: Hmm.

867
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:45,844
Julia: -more depth in my
relationships with people, but

868
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:51,364
also like, more depth in working
with a- a more focused tech

869
00:45:51,364 --> 00:45:54,048
stack, because it does get
pretty exhausting. Like, just

870
00:45:54,048 --> 00:45:56,732
bouncing

871
00:45:56,739 --> 00:46:00,333
from one thing to another and
kinda feeling like I never

872
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:06,063
work with any one thing long
enough to really have any

873
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:10,534
mastery. And like, I know I'm
learning cuz when I come back to

874
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:19,023
stuff later, like, I can achieve
more complex results, and I can

875
00:46:19,204 --> 00:46:22,443
work faster, and I can
troubleshoot better. But, like,

876
00:46:22,443 --> 00:46:27,813
I don't ever feel -- I- I never
exactly feel competent [laughs].

877
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:28,858
Bekah: Yeah.

878
00:46:29,494 --> 00:46:33,063
Julia: And that's kinda tough
sometimes.

879
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:34,700
Dan: Yeah. Totally get that. I
mean, like, digging in all the

880
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,000
way into something

881
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,700
can feel good. It -- you know,
[chuckles] I- I was gonna make

882
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,009
some joke

883
00:46:40,009 --> 00:46:41,344
about how that's like, just
being a JavaScript in general,

884
00:46:41,344 --> 00:46:42,679
where

885
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:43,700
everything's always new and
changing-

886
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,000
Julia: Yeah, yeah.

887
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:44,949
Dan: -you know [laughs]?

888
00:46:44,949 --> 00:46:46,923
Julia: Well, I know. That's-
that's, like, absolutely-

889
00:46:46,188 --> 00:46:46,509
Dan: But- but then it's --

890
00:46:46,923 --> 00:46:49,114
Julia: -an industry wide
phenomenon.

891
00:46:49,398 --> 00:46:52,700
Dan: Right. But still, I mean, I
-- you know, I still have been

892
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,599
doing RAD for, like, years, you
know? And it's like, I actually

893
00:46:56,659 --> 00:46:58,309
know it, like, pretty well. You
know what I mean [laughs]? And

894
00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:00,000
it's- and it's- and it's nice to
be able to do that.

895
00:46:58,384 --> 00:47:02,000
Julia: Yeah. And I would say,
like, it's like ... you know,

896
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,143
[deep exhales] earlier this
spring, I was

897
00:47:04,143 --> 00:47:08,433
working on this kinda
complicated .NET sequel thing,

898
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:12,723
and

899
00:47:13,474 --> 00:47:15,994
then I'm working in Unity, and I
have to learn Xcode, and how to

900
00:47:15,994 --> 00:47:18,514
do

901
00:47:18,514 --> 00:47:24,264
iOS development. And also on the
side, I'm working with GraphQL,

902
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:29,000
and, like -- it's like, I just
-- I- I mean, I really bounce

903
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,500
around a lot.

904
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,463
And occasionally, they'll be
like, "Do you know Angular?" And

905
00:47:32,463 --> 00:47:36,700
I'm like, "Oh." [All laugh]
That's -- the- the- the GraphQL

906
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,974
client. We're all in agreement.

907
00:47:38,974 --> 00:47:42,273
The- the next thing -- the next
deliverable is for me to do

908
00:47:42,273 --> 00:47:46,114
something in Flutter. And I'm
like, "Oh, for Christ's sake."

909
00:47:46,324 --> 00:47:48,153
Dan: Yeah. You were -- I saw you
mentioned that on Slack. I don't

910
00:47:48,153 --> 00:47:49,893
even know what Flutter is
really. What is it?

911
00:47:49,963 --> 00:47:56,239
Julia: It's- it's a mobile
framework. So, it's like a --

912
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:01,398
but it's ... so --

913
00:48:01,923 --> 00:48:02,224
Dan: Like JavaScript? But ...
makes mobile apps?

914
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:05,179
Julia: Yeah. But it's --

915
00:48:05,344 --> 00:48:05,853
Dan: I suppose I could look it
up.

916
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:08,500
Bekah: It seems like a React
Native competitor. Am I wrong

917
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,914
about that?

918
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:12,000
Julia: It's a React Native
competitor. It -- I can't

919
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,978
remember what the big advantage
is over React Native.

920
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:18,574
Bekah: Well, I've heard a lot of
React Native. People say there's

921
00:48:18,574 --> 00:48:19,054
no advantage [laughs].

922
00:48:21,603 --> 00:48:25,324
Dan: Well, React Native is
really annoying. So, if this is

923
00:48:25,324 --> 00:48:28,293
better than, you know? I've just
started my first React -- I just

924
00:48:28,298 --> 00:48:30,483
started digging to React Native
for the first time, like, a

925
00:48:30,489 --> 00:48:32,700
month or two ago. And-

926
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Julia: Yeah. It's a React Native
competitor-

927
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:32,884
Dan: -I'm still in that -- I'm
just at a mad phase.

928
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:36,528
Julia: -and the- and the idea is
that, like- like, React Native,

929
00:48:36,588 --> 00:48:42,199
it's- it's, like, device
agnostic. Like, it's not like

930
00:48:42,409 --> 00:48:44,298
writing an iOS app or
[inaudible].

931
00:48:44,494 --> 00:48:45,708
Dan: Right, right. Wants to
published anywhere kind of

932
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:46,922
thing.

933
00:48:47,253 --> 00:48:47,463
Yeah.

934
00:48:47,568 --> 00:48:47,958
Julia: Yeah.

935
00:48:48,784 --> 00:48:51,543
Dan: Yeah. I mean, starting from
scratch, i-in a, like, a big way

936
00:48:51,543 --> 00:48:55,923
like that is- is hard, you know?
I was- I was just thinking in my

937
00:48:55,923 --> 00:48:57,700
head, I was just, like,
outlining a blog post about,

938
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,594
like, how I

939
00:48:58,713 --> 00:49:00,700
learned things, you know, from
scratch, you know? And-

940
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,300
Julia: Mm-hmm.

941
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:01,384
Dan: -like, the

942
00:49:01,384 --> 00:49:04,173
bigger it is, like, the -- it's
just like you were talking about

943
00:49:04,173 --> 00:49:09,784
the game app, right? The, like,
the further away from what

944
00:49:09,784 --> 00:49:12,000
you're used to it is the harder
it is. I mean- I mean, like,

945
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,500
that's an, like, an obvious
statement. But it's, like, it's-

946
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,664
it's much more -- for me, it's

947
00:49:15,664 --> 00:49:18,700
much more exhausting too and it
takes longer, but it's also-

948
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,000
Julia: Yeah.

949
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,000
Dan: -like, harder, [laughs] you
know- you know what I mean?

950
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:22,700
Julia: Yeah.

951
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,034
Dan: Like, it's not just a

952
00:49:24,063 --> 00:49:26,434
simple, "Oh, it just takes two
days instead of half an hour,"

953
00:49:26,438 --> 00:49:28,300
if it's, you know, some package
or whatever, you know?

954
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:28,563
[Inaudible].

955
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:30,349
Julia: Well, it's like, you
know, we- we --

956
00:49:30,713 --> 00:49:31,534
Dan: And it's -- it is. It's
hard sometimes.

957
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:34,500
Julia: We're all- all -- like,
the idea that it's hard to

958
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,700
estimate how long things will
take is obviously well known

959
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:41,989
phenomenon. But when you don't
know anything [laughs]?

960
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:43,068
Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

961
00:49:43,338 --> 00:49:45,829
Julia: It's impossible to
estimate. It's like [inaudible]-

962
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:47,028
Dan: Oh, I mean -- yeah.

963
00:49:47,114 --> 00:49:49,700
Julia: -probably roughly
estimate how long it'll take me

964
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:50,148
to, like,

965
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,778
write something in Flutter.
Because I read about it and I

966
00:49:53,778 --> 00:49:56,300
was like, "Oh, okay. This is not
radically different than

967
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,000
anything I've done before."

968
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Dan: Right.

969
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,500
Julia: But with game
development, it's like, "Oh,

970
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,800
gee." Like, this is, you know,
there's just reams of files that

971
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,088
I'm like, "I have no idea what
any of these do [laughs]."

972
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:12,289
Dan: Yeah.

973
00:50:12,798 --> 00:50:17,000
Julia: You know? I don't know.
It's just -- and yeah. I'm a-

974
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I'm a terrible jaw clincher,
like, I just all day, every day.

975
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,500
And over the last few months, as
I've been working on this, like,

976
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,000
these few particularly

977
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,829
difficult projects, I- I
actually went to the dentist.

978
00:50:33,858 --> 00:50:37,300
And I was like, "You have to
help me [laughs]." Like, "I'm

979
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:42,300
going crazy." So that's why I
now ... sugar-free-

980
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:42,500
Bekah: Aah.

981
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,858
Julia: -Werthers Original. I'm
like an 80 year old diabetic

982
00:50:45,858 --> 00:50:47,539
[Bekah laughs].

983
00:50:47,539 --> 00:50:52,000
I suck on sugar-free Werthers
Original all day, cuz-

984
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:52,300
Dan: Nice.

985
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,628
Julia: -it keeps me from
punching my teeth.

986
00:50:54,094 --> 00:50:56,700
Bekah: That's interesting. My
dentist sent me to my

987
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,503
chiropractor to

988
00:50:58,503 --> 00:51:02,974
have my jaw adjusted. That is
one of, like, the most awkward,

989
00:51:03,244 --> 00:51:08,193
uncomfortable adjustments that I
have had. But I am also a jaw

990
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:12,903
clincher and it was causing my
tooth to grow thickening roots

991
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,824
that were starting to protrude
in my gums [laughs].

992
00:51:16,009 --> 00:51:21,300
Julia: Yeah. Yeah. No, that's
what I, like ... yeah. Anyway.

993
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,884
We don't need to get into my
oral health [all laugh].

994
00:51:27,228 --> 00:51:29,929
Dan: You mentioned the, you
know, estimating and all that

995
00:51:29,929 --> 00:51:32,358
stuff. And I- I- I actually,
like, I was been wondering about

996
00:51:32,364 --> 00:51:34,009
this since you talked about it,
especially since you're a

997
00:51:34,009 --> 00:51:38,659
contractor. How, like, how it
works? What, like, your

998
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:41,748
arrangement? I mean, you get an
assignment of writing an article

999
00:51:41,748 --> 00:51:44,000
about something that you don't
know about yet. And so-

1000
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:44,500
Julia: Right.

1001
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,318
Dan: -like, how

1002
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:47,300
does that- how does that break
down? How does- how does --

1003
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,000
what's the process of, like --
cuz- cuz if I have a project,

1004
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,449
you know, maybe I try

1005
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:52,938
to estimate it or something, and
there's always unknowns, but-

1006
00:51:52,938 --> 00:51:53,599
Julia: Right.

1007
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,000
Dan: -with writing assignments,
lots of times it's -- there's

1008
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
other ... [chuckles] you know,
it's- it's per pages.

1009
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,300
Julia: You know --

1010
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,599
Dan: Like, there's like --
there's lots of

1011
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,164
different ways. And so is it
just ... you kinda treat it like

1012
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:03,500
a software project and estimate-

1013
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,554
Julia: Yeah. The writing- the
writing-

1014
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,554
Dan: -hourly and deliver
everything at the end, or --

1015
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:08,074
Julia: -process -- the writing
process doesn't really take me

1016
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:14,700
that much time. So, like, if I'm
writing about something that I

1017
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,213
already

1018
00:52:15,213 --> 00:52:21,514
understand really well or just,
like, a very simple API where I

1019
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:28,000
just wanna show, like, very
basic, like, "Here's- here's how

1020
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,094
to call it the first time." I
know very well how long that'll

1021
00:52:33,094 --> 00:52:35,500
take me, like, the writing
process. Just -- it's just --

1022
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:40,000
it's, like, as ... I don't know.

1023
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,700
I -- the di- so, one of the
differences is when I was

1024
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:45,934
working —

1025
00:52:46,143 --> 00:52:50,614
before I kinda got brought in
house as a staff writer, then I

1026
00:52:50,614 --> 00:52:58,563
was paid by piece. And it was a
standard rate. And the

1027
00:52:58,563 --> 00:53:03,333
pieces that I was getting were
pretty standardized. At the

1028
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:07,503
point that it started getting
more complex, where it was like,

1029
00:53:07,503 --> 00:53:12,003
Hey, stuff's coming back to me
from the client, like, asking me

1030
00:53:12,003 --> 00:53:16,000
for a lot of revisions that,
like, were not in scope," you

1031
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,813
know [laughs]?

1032
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,300
Bekah: Mm.

1033
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:16,700
Dan: Mm-hmm.

1034
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Julia: Then it was like, "Can we
have a conversation about

1035
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,500
changing how I'm compensated?
Because this is not- this is not

1036
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,000
standard."

1037
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:25,500
Bekah: Yeah.

1038
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,300
Julia: Now, I'm paid a m- a
monthly retainer. And our

1039
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:35,500
project manager sort of -- I can
wo- I communicate with her

1040
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,684
about, like, where I'm at on

1041
00:53:37,684 --> 00:53:44,494
different stuff. And we kind of
scale how- how much I take on

1042
00:53:44,494 --> 00:53:47,043
just based on how long things
are taking. So --

1043
00:53:47,063 --> 00:53:47,873
Dan: Yeah. Nice.

1044
00:53:48,244 --> 00:53:51,634
Julia: Yeah. Yeah. It's not --
it's- it's pretty- it's pretty

1045
00:53:51,634 --> 00:53:56,793
flexible. They had expectations
when I came on board as a staff

1046
00:53:56,793 --> 00:54:00,300
writer, that turned out to be,
like, really wacky. But

1047
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,500
everybody realized it very
quickly, like [chuckles], I

1048
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:08,700
cannot produce 10 articles a
month if I have to learn an

1049
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,938
entirely new framework for every
single article.

1050
00:54:10,938 --> 00:54:11,700
Bekah: I don't know if anybody-

1051
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:11,700
Dan: Right. Yeah.

1052
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:16,700
Bekah: -can produce 10 articles
a month. Like, that's just a lot

1053
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,700
of- [chuckles] a lot of way
[??].

1054
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:21,700
Julia: Yeah. I mean, like, I
could do 10 if they're all just,

1055
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,159
like --

1056
00:54:23,074 --> 00:54:24,094
Dan: It's stuff you already
know, right?

1057
00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:25,699
Julia: Yeah. 500 words on-

1058
00:54:26,673 --> 00:54:27,063
Dan: Yeah, right. Yeah.

1059
00:54:27,918 --> 00:54:28,398
Julia: -you know-

1060
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:29,594
Dan: No, that's cool.

1061
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:33,000
Julia: -why you should have docs
for your API [Dan and Bekah

1062
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,778
chuckle]. I'm good. I could

1063
00:54:35,778 --> 00:54:42,768
write a lot of those. But, yeah.
It's ... I don't know. It's

1064
00:54:42,768 --> 00:54:45,139
interesting though. I think I
was talking about this with you

1065
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:51,500
recently, Bekah. Like, feeling
kind of like -- I do think I'm

1066
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,239
underpaid,

1067
00:54:53,628 --> 00:54:59,688
maybe? Because I think that the
amount that I actually get done-

1068
00:54:59,688 --> 00:55:00,079
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

1069
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,000
Julia: -is probably on par with
somebody who's a full-time

1070
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,159
employee.

1071
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:16,858
But I'm paid as a part-time 1099
employee, because I don't have

1072
00:55:17,568 --> 00:55:23,298
this sort of like official role
in the organization. The

1073
00:55:23,298 --> 00:55:30,000
upside is I have very few
meetings [laughs] which I love.

1074
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:40,000
But it's also harder to kind of
-- I- I don't -- it's hard for

1075
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,759
me to ... really,

1076
00:55:43,759 --> 00:55:51,454
like, figure out what, like,
what my compensation should be

1077
00:55:51,454 --> 00:55:55,500
because I don't really know how,
like, my role compares to

1078
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,300
somebody who's in house
somewhere. Although I will say

1079
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:58,713
I interviewed

1080
00:55:58,713 --> 00:56:03,003
for a role somewhere recently
where they said something like,

1081
00:56:03,244 --> 00:56:06,514
"Oh, our full-time writers write
about four articles a month."

1082
00:56:06,514 --> 00:56:17,014
And I was like, [laughs] "What?"
Like, "Oh, okay. I could do that

1083
00:56:18,063 --> 00:56:18,483
very easily." Like -- but, yeah.

1084
00:56:18,824 --> 00:56:21,700
Dan: Yeah. Well, no. I mean,
that's- that's -- I mean ...

1085
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,253
yeah. It's gotta

1086
00:56:23,253 --> 00:56:25,773
be tough, but like, the -- I,
you know, I was thinking about

1087
00:56:25,773 --> 00:56:28,000
this when you were talking about
the, like, actual

1088
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,728
different articles

1089
00:56:28,728 --> 00:56:31,668
you were writing. And, you know,
some of the thought processes

1090
00:56:31,668 --> 00:56:35,929
you are explaining are complex
things, right? That- that- that

1091
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:38,958
are targeted towards more senior
developers, right? You're not

1092
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:42,559
writing the -- you're not being
asked to write the, like, sort

1093
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:44,929
of super inter- I mean, maybe
you are. But, like, lots-

1094
00:56:45,454 --> 00:56:46,474
Julia: Yeah. On --

1095
00:56:46,579 --> 00:56:47,500
Dan: -of times, lots of time
you're not writing the super

1096
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,309
intro basic stuff or the SEO,
you know, fodder stuff, right?

1097
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:52,700
You're- you're writing --

1098
00:56:52,489 --> 00:56:55,489
Julia: No. Right. And that's
something that we -- like, as a

1099
00:56:55,489 --> 00:57:01,878
company, we're like, "Listen.
We're -- we'll like try to make

1100
00:57:01,878 --> 00:57:07,000
the stuff that we write
reasonably optimized, SEO wise.

1101
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,938
But that's

1102
00:57:07,938 --> 00:57:13,800
not what we're here for. Like,
we are not here to, like, you

1103
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,500
know, just create fluff content.
Like, we want content that

1104
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:23,500
actually engages developers for
the long term." And there is

1105
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:29,208
definitely, like, you have to be
discoverable. And some of

1106
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:35,148
that is like identifying search
terms that just have really low

1107
00:57:35,148 --> 00:57:42,500
results volume. So, like, for
example. Just recently, it was,

1108
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:42,708
like, we

1109
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:46,248
noticed that there's very few
results for the search phrase,

1110
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:49,608
JSON payload. And so we went to
one of our clients. And we're

1111
00:57:49,608 --> 00:57:54,858
like, "Can we write something on
this term? Like, it's relevant

1112
00:57:54,858 --> 00:57:58,458
to you. And like it's relevant
to developers. People are

1113
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:03,000
searching for it and there's not
that much content." But it's

1114
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,889
based on

1115
00:58:03,893 --> 00:58:07,309
the idea that like, people are
searching for this because they

1116
00:58:07,398 --> 00:58:09,500
want information, not like-

1117
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:09,700
Dan: Mm-hmm.

1118
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,869
Julia: -they're searching for
it. And so,

1119
00:58:11,873 --> 00:58:18,228
like, let's- let's create the
fluff. I think -- so the- the

1120
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:21,000
principal of our -- the
principal consultant is, he

1121
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,619
wrote a

1122
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:24,708
book called "Developer Marketing
Does Not Exist", which I think

1123
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:28,700
is kind of a goofy title. That
was a face of recognition.

1124
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,079
Bekah, do you know the book?

1125
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,500
Bekah: Yes. I -- it's -- so, I
don't know who recommended it to

1126
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,100
me. But it's definitely on my
list of books that I should

1127
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:35,329
read.

1128
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:39,588
Julia: Yeah. He's -- and the
idea is basically, like, if

1129
00:58:39,588 --> 00:58:43,009
developers feel like they're
being marketed to, like, they're

1130
00:58:43,009 --> 00:58:47,119
not gonna -- nobody wants that.
Like, I wanna know that a

1131
00:58:47,449 --> 00:58:51,139
product is gonna actually solve
my problem. I wanna know that,

1132
00:58:51,139 --> 00:58:54,000
like, if I start using
something, I'm gonna be fully

1133
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,608
supported in my

1134
00:58:55,639 --> 00:59:00,228
journey as a technical user. And
so, like, the content that we're

1135
00:59:00,228 --> 00:59:04,000
creating is really geared
towards that developer

1136
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,909
experience of

1137
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:10,608
like, "Okay, great. You made it
to our website. You signed, you

1138
00:59:10,608 --> 00:59:15,889
know, you signed up for your
free trial account. Are you

1139
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:20,748
gonna actually be able to get
stuff done? And are you gonna

1140
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:27,768
feel successful and empowered by
the content that you find here?

1141
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:29,793
Or are you gonna feel like
you're being, you know, told

1142
00:59:29,793 --> 00:59:31,788
exactly how

1143
00:59:31,789 --> 00:59:33,829
to do it? And if you wanna do
anything different, you have

1144
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:40,338
absolutely no idea how to make
it work." Yeah. I can't remember

1145
00:59:40,338 --> 00:59:43,039
what you said that made me just
march [??] into that. But --

1146
00:59:43,489 --> 00:59:45,300
Dan: Mm-hmm. No. I was just
talking about the -- yeah, I was

1147
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:50,179
talking about how the content
you're writing is- is- is ...

1148
00:59:50,179 --> 00:59:52,518
talking about some high level
concepts and, you know-

1149
00:59:52,699 --> 00:59:53,268
Julia: Oh, yeah, yeah. Like-
like --

1150
00:59:54,168 --> 00:59:56,568
Dan: -it was mostly just- mostly
just, like, you're operating on

1151
00:59:56,574 --> 01:00:00,300
like a senior developer level,
you know? Well- well -- and you

1152
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:00,768
were talking about

1153
01:00:00,768 --> 01:00:02,300
competition before. And that's
what made- made me start-

1154
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:02,500
Julia: Yeah.

1155
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,329
Dan: -talking about this, you
know?

1156
01:00:05,329 --> 01:00:05,500
Julia: Yeah.

1157
01:00:05,329 --> 01:00:05,869
Dan: But, like the- the --

1158
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:08,000
Julia: And then, that's -- well,
the hard -- part of the hard

1159
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
thing for me is, like, I really,

1160
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,608
genuinely love what I do and
that actually makes it harder

1161
01:00:13,909 --> 01:00:18,108
for me to, like, fight for the
compensation [laughs].

1162
01:00:18,934 --> 01:00:20,494
Dan: Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I hear
that.

1163
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,300
Julia: I also have a hard [??]
time with the fact that right

1164
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:28,500
now, like, I work from ten to
three ... roughly.

1165
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,954
Sometimes I work a little in the
evenings, sometimes I

1166
01:00:31,954 --> 01:00:36,184
get started a little earlier in
the morning, but, like, I really

1167
01:00:36,184 --> 01:00:38,704
only work like 20, 25 hours a
week.

1168
01:00:39,724 --> 01:00:40,023
Dan: Yeah.

1169
01:00:40,923 --> 01:00:44,000
Julia: [Deep exhales] And I'm --
I just -- I know that, like,

1170
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,873
taking a full-time job,

1171
01:00:45,873 --> 01:00:48,844
like, the difference that
additional 10 to 15 hours a week

1172
01:00:48,873 --> 01:00:50,000
is just gonna be meetings-

1173
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,200
Bekah: Yes.

1174
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:54,393
Julia: -and like, annoying
emails. And like, I

1175
01:00:54,393 --> 01:00:59,583
don't -- like, am I willing to
take less money to not deal with

1176
01:00:59,588 --> 01:01:02,300
that stuff? Like -- and have the
flexibility in my schedule?

1177
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,300
Like, yeah. I guess I am
[chuckles].

1178
01:01:03,414 --> 01:01:06,000
Dan: Yep. I mean, if you really-
really wanted or needed

1179
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,054
more money, you

1180
01:01:07,054 --> 01:01:09,123
could pick up more clients too.
Like, that's the beauty of being

1181
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:10,744
independent. It's -- you can do
what you want.

1182
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Julia: Yeah, it's true. It's
true. I could. And I do, you

1183
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,063
know, I toy it with that
[laughs], but --

1184
01:01:18,063 --> 01:01:20,193
Dan: Or just raise your rates,
you know? It's all- all good.

1185
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:20,300
Julia: Yeah, yeah.

1186
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,603
Dan: Just send up an email.
That'll be fine.

1187
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:28,429
Julia: Yeah, it's true. I have
such anxiety about -- I think I

1188
01:01:28,429 --> 01:01:31,639
better deliver a couple of
successful projects on these two

1189
01:01:31,639 --> 01:01:34,518
nightmare clients before I ask
for --

1190
01:01:35,554 --> 01:01:37,500
Dan: Yes. Say, "Now that I am a
game developer-

1191
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,500
Julia: [Laughs] Yeah, right.

1192
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,454
Dan: -this is my new rate
[chuckles]."

1193
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:45,739
Julia: [Laughs] I guess we all
-- the game developers are paid.

1194
01:01:47,224 --> 01:01:50,704
Dan: Now that I'm a Flutter
developer, this is my new rate.

1195
01:01:50,778 --> 01:01:53,628
Julia: All developers are, like,
hideously underpaid.

1196
01:01:54,664 --> 01:01:56,614
Dan: Well, now that I'm --

1197
01:01:58,903 --> 01:02:00,614
Bekah: [Laughs] An Angular
developer.

1198
01:02:00,963 --> 01:02:05,764
Dan: I'll- I'll write it for
you. To whom it may concern --

1199
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Julia: Yeah.

1200
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:07,700
Bekah: I know --

1201
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:11,119
Julia: It's interesting. I mean,
the whole game development world

1202
01:02:11,123 --> 01:02:12,139
is like its own --

1203
01:02:12,909 --> 01:02:16,000
Dan: Yeah, I don't know anything
about it. Yeah. So far,

1204
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,333
separated from ... it's -- it

1205
01:02:18,338 --> 01:02:20,000
is weird. Like, the -- if you
think about it. Cuz I, you know,

1206
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,543
I- I- I get a lot

1207
01:02:21,543 --> 01:02:24,094
of over- I mean, obviously, most
of my overlap is with other web

1208
01:02:24,094 --> 01:02:26,643
developers in different
technologies. But even so,

1209
01:02:26,643 --> 01:02:30,934
there's ... I don't know anybody
does game development, you know?

1210
01:02:30,934 --> 01:02:33,000
[Chuckles] Just, like -- and I
know a lot of developers a-and

1211
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,500
it's just, yeah. It's --

1212
01:02:32,809 --> 01:02:36,978
Julia: Yeah. I mean, I've lived
in Seattle for 17 years. Like,

1213
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:45,768
I've -- I know people at so many
different tech companies. I know

1214
01:02:45,768 --> 01:02:50,000
recruiters all over the place.
And at one point, I was --

1215
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,300
somebody had expressed an
interest in working for a game

1216
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,199
company. And I was

1217
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:59,418
like, "Well, I'll reach out."
But like ... it was like, you

1218
01:02:59,418 --> 01:03:02,700
know, one person was like,
"Well, I- I know that the VP of

1219
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:03,829
HR at Wizards

1220
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:07,148
of the Coast. But that's about
as close as I can get." I was

1221
01:03:07,148 --> 01:03:08,700
like, "Well, I don't think
that's quite what we're

1222
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,068
looking for [Julia and Dan
chuckle]."

1223
01:03:14,778 --> 01:03:16,578
Bekah: Well, Julia, this has
been a really great

1224
01:03:16,578 --> 01:03:18,378
conversation.

1225
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:22,000
And -- but it is time to wrap it
up.

1226
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,300
Julia: Yes.

1227
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,700
Bekah: So, is there-

1228
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,000
Julia: Yes.

1229
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,500
Bekah: -any last words of wisdom

1230
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:32,599
you have for our listeners or
things you want them to --

1231
01:03:33,048 --> 01:03:35,418
you think they would benefit
from learning about?

1232
01:03:36,978 --> 01:03:42,972
Julia: Nah, I don't -- I was
hanging with David Alpert a

1233
01:03:42,972 --> 01:03:47,500
couple weeks ago, and we were
talking about the idea that,

1234
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:53,353
like ... [exhales] it

1235
01:03:53,353 --> 01:03:57,523
was after I gave the lunch and
learn about feedback. We were

1236
01:03:57,523 --> 01:04:04,000
talking about the idea that,
like, giving feedback, being

1237
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
a mentor of some kind,

1238
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,463
formal or informal, is sort of
an intrinsic part of your

1239
01:04:12,463 --> 01:04:20,172
responsibility in- in the tech
industry. And I- I think it's

1240
01:04:20,177 --> 01:04:23,000
a really -- it's something I
think about a fair amount that,

1241
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:29,000
like, you know, I don't
necessarily have like ... a huge

1242
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:29,802
wealth of

1243
01:04:29,802 --> 01:04:34,152
technical experience. I haven't
been in the industry that

1244
01:04:34,157 --> 01:04:38,472
long. But I think it's just
really important for everybody

1245
01:04:38,472 --> 01:04:44,773
to remember that, like, you have
valuable experience, and

1246
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:50,000
knowledge, and skills, and
insight. And, you know, all of

1247
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,282
us are always

1248
01:04:51,282 --> 01:04:59,713
learning and we should all
always be teaching as well. And

1249
01:04:59,717 --> 01:05:06,402
that's not- that's not like to
say that you need to be, you

1250
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:12,043
know, giving formal instruction
on something. But that, like, we

1251
01:05:12,103 --> 01:05:18,043
all benefit from people sharing
what they know, sharing their

1252
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:26,592
perspectives. You may not be an
expert in anything, but

1253
01:05:26,592 --> 01:05:30,000
you're an expert in being
yourself, right? You know? And

1254
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,612
it's like, I

1255
01:05:31,123 --> 01:05:35,322
talking with somebody who has a
lot of experience in- in, like,

1256
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:39,012
tech support. And I was like,
"Listen, you may not think of

1257
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:46,032
yourself this way, but you are a
UX expert. Like, you know more

1258
01:05:46,032 --> 01:05:53,000
about actual user experience
than, like, almost anybody. If

1259
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
you've worked in tech support
for three years or whatever,

1260
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,463
like, you have

1261
01:05:57,463 --> 01:06:03,702
so much hands on knowledge and
insight into how people use

1262
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:10,700
technology, share that. Like, at
-- but also, like, before you

1263
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,413
can share

1264
01:06:11,413 --> 01:06:15,072
it, you have to actually reflect
on it and try to like, give it

1265
01:06:15,072 --> 01:06:18,500
some framework." And I think
that that's something I've

1266
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:27,700
really been trying to do myself.
Is, like, I know that I know

1267
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:31,500
things. How can I put them in a
framework that allows me to

1268
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,382
share them with

1269
01:06:32,382 --> 01:06:39,103
other people? So, yeah. We're
all always learning. We also

1270
01:06:39,108 --> 01:06:44,300
should all always be teaching.
And I think that's ... I dunno.

1271
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:44,503
Yeah.

1272
01:06:44,943 --> 01:06:47,112
Bekah: I love that. That's so
great. And what a great way to

1273
01:06:47,112 --> 01:06:49,693
end this episode. So, thanks so
much, Julia, for being with us.

1274
01:06:49,693 --> 01:06:50,632
We- we had a great time today.

1275
01:06:50,682 --> 01:06:52,333
Julia: Absolutely! My pleasure.

1276
01:06:52,637 --> 01:06:55,300
Dan: Thanks, Julia. Also I
looked that up. And the most

1277
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:58,300
expensive precious metal is
rhodium. So-

1278
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:58,500
Julia: Oh.

1279
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,222
Dan: -if you are going that
direction,

1280
01:07:00,222 --> 01:07:02,300
rhodium is gonna be what --
where you're going. I've never

1281
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:02,623
heard of it before. But --

1282
01:07:02,793 --> 01:07:04,000
Julia: Rhodium. Well, I know
that-

1283
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,000
Bekah: Do you use it --

1284
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,922
Julia: -rhodium-

1285
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,000
Dan: Are- are right jewel- [??]

1286
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,922
Julia: -jewelry is rhodium
plating.

1287
01:07:08,922 --> 01:07:10,617
Bekah: Yeah.

1288
01:07:10,617 --> 01:07:11,128
Dan: Huh? That's because that's-

1289
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:11,532
Bekah: Well, what else --

1290
01:07:11,818 --> 01:07:16,600
Dan: -that's -- it's fancy
[chuckles]. I don't- I don't

1291
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:16,797
know.

1292
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:19,100
Bekah: Do we [unintelligible]
here? I don't believe you

1293
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:19,108
[laughs].

1294
01:07:19,498 --> 01:07:22,708
Dan: It's used for -- oh, it's
very reflective. So it's used in

1295
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:25,700
search lights, mirrors, and
jewelry [chuckles]. I think it's

1296
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,000
mostly just that it's rare. I
don't know. Anyway --

1297
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:28,300
Julia: I would --

1298
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,000
Dan: That's it [laughs].

1299
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Julia: Yeah.

1300
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,000
Dan: That's all I got [all
laugh].

1301
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,000
Julia: Good.

1302
01:07:35,422 --> 01:07:38,500
Dan: All right. Cool. Well,
thank you, Julia. I [laughs] --

1303
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,000
