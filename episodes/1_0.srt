1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,410
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hey, I'm
Bekah.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,370
Dan Ott: And I'm Dan.

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:07,860
Bekah: And this is the Virtual
Coffee Podcast,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,500
where we interview members of
the community to learn more

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,500
about their stories, who they
are, how they found Virtual

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,859
Coffee, and how that influences
their lives as developers.

7
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:19,609
Dan: We wanted to bring
everything that's special about

8
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:23,000
Virtual Coffee. The intimacy and
the friendships we've built, and

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,010
share that with everyone through
the podcast.

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,100
Bekah: 2020 has been a tough
year, but Virtual

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,469
Coffee is the bright spot that's
become this community.

12
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:33,509
Dan: We're always growing and
learning together as a

13
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:36,179
group. And there's something
really special about being able

14
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:38,759
to do that, knowing you have the
full support of the community

15
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,338
around you. And that's what this
podcast is about too.

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,149
Bekah: We're kicking off the
season by

17
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:47,329
hearing from Nick Taylor about
live streaming and open source.

18
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:50,090
Nick Taylor: This, this is kind
of where my journey of

19
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,649
structured YOLO begins.

20
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,590
Bekah: Marie Antons about coming
into tech

21
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,179
from a nontraditional
background.

22
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,179
Marie Antons: Previous
experience really helps you in

23
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:02,270
software development. Because
think of a recipe is kind of

24
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,060
like building a website, like,
"Oh, I know I need this piece.

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,480
But what if I don't know how to
do this piece? I'll go look it

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,750
up, go watch a YouTube video."
And then eventually, you get to

27
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,060
a place where you're like,
comfortable. "Oh, I can make

28
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,484
cookies now without looking at
the recipe. I can make this, I

29
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:16,908
can

30
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:18,979
do-- I can create a modal, I can
do the CSS Grid without

31
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,049
really

32
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:22,609
having to go to the
documentation every single

33
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,169
time."

34
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,480
Bekah: And Tori Crawford about
the problems of

35
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,010
interviewing in the industry.

36
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,590
Tori Crawford: Interviewing was
crazy for me. I think I went

37
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:41,930
through 53 interviews. Yeah, it
was, like, quite a struggle at

38
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:42,620
times.

39
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,500
Dan: You also get a special
bonus episode that we recorded

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,969
live after Hacktoberfest.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,060
Kirk Shillingford: Hacktoberfest
happened because we were like,

42
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,140
"Hey, we wanna do something
good," you know? And then people

43
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,349
were like, "I don't wanna do
this with strangers, but I

44
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:58,879
wouldn't mind doing it with-
with everybody here." And I

45
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,409
think

46
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:01,339
that's like very important.
Like, I wouldn't have done this

47
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:02,269
with

48
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:05,750
people who I didn't consider,
like, friends, and good people.

49
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:09,020
Bekah: Best of all, you'll get
to hear so much

50
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,479
of the heart that goes into the
community. And we're very

51
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,800
excited to share that with you.

52
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,539
