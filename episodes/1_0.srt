1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,410
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hey, I'm
Bekah.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,370
Dan Ott: And I'm Dan.

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:07,860
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: And this is
the Virtual Coffee Podcast,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,500
where we interview members of
the community to learn more

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,500
about their stories, who they
are, how they found Virtual

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,859
Coffee, and how that influences
their lives as developers.

7
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:19,609
Dan Ott: We wanted to bring
everything that's special about

8
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:23,000
Virtual Coffee, the intimacy and
the friendships we've built, and

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,010
share that with everyone through
the podcast.

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,100
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: 2020 has
been a tough year, but Virtual

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,469
Coffee is the bright spot that's
become this community.

12
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:33,509
Dan Ott: We're always growing
and learning together as a

13
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:36,179
group. And there's something
really special about being able

14
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:38,759
to do that, knowing you have the
full support of the community

15
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,338
around you. And that's what this
podcast is about too.

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,149
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We're
kicking off the season by

17
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:47,329
hearing from Nick Taylor about
live streaming and open source.

18
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:50,090
Nicky Taylor: This, this is kind
of where my journey of

19
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,649
structured YOLO begins.

20
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,590
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Marie
Antons about coming into tech

21
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,179
from a non traditional
background,

22
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,179
Marie Antons: Previous
experience really helps you in

23
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:02,270
software development. Because
think of a recipe is kind of

24
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,060
like building a website, like,
Oh, I know, I need this piece.

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,480
But what if I don't know how to
do this piece? I'll go look it

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,750
up, go watch a YouTube video.
And then eventually, you get to

27
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,060
a place where you're like,
comfortable. Oh, I can make

28
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,909
cookies now without looking at
the recipe. I can make this I can

29
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:21,049
do, I can create a modal, I can
do the CSS Grid without really

30
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:24,170
having to go to the
documentation every single time.

31
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,480
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: And Tori
Crawford about the problems of

32
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,010
interviewing in the industry.

33
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,590
Tori Crawford: Interviewing was
crazy for me. I think I went

34
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:41,930
through 53 interviews. Yeah, it
was, like, quite a struggle at

35
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:42,620
times.

36
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,500
Dan Ott: You also get a special
bonus episode that we recorded

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,969
live after Hacktoberfest.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,060
Kirk Shillingford: Hacktoberfest
happened because we were like,

39
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,140
Hey, we want to do something
good, you know? And then people

40
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,349
were like, I don't want to do
this with strangers, but I

41
00:01:57,349 --> 00:02:00,409
wouldn't mind doing it with with
everybody here. And I think

42
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,269
that's like very important. Like
I wouldn't have done this with

43
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:05,750
people who I didn't consider
like friends, and good people.

44
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:09,020
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Best of
all, you'll get to hear so much

45
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,479
of the heart that goes into the
community. And we're very

46
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,800
excited to share that with you.

47
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,539
Dan Ott: If you'd like to learn
