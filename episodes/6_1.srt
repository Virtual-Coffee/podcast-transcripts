00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:13,105
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm Bekah

00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,315
Dan: we're back.

00:00:18,356 --> 00:00:22,495
Bekah: Bekah we are back. We are
back featuring members of the

5
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:26,175
Virtual Coffee community, a
community that is an intimate

6
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:29,635
group of developers at all stages
of their coding journey. And

7
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:32,045
they're here on this podcast,
sharing their stories and what

8
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:37,000
they've. We are here to share it
with you. Obviously you're with

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,240
me today is my cohost. Dan

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,256
Dan: Wuddup Bek, how's it going?

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,210
Bekah: Do you do that every
season one intro?

12
00:00:46,856 --> 00:00:52,570
Dan: I hope so. Probably not. Now
I will from here on out.

13
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,691
Bekah: you remember that? In
season seven? Hmm.

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,670
Dan: but it probably won't be the
only time I say wuddup Bek

15
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:01,926
either. So, you know, how's it
going?

16
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:06,251
Bekah: Um, it's going great
because we're launching the new

17
00:01:06,251 --> 00:01:07,240
season of the podcast!

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,921
Dan: Um, yes, we are. It was, um,
season five was pretty awesome.

19
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,215
And season six is also gonna be
awesome.

20
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:24,221
Bekah: It is true. It is always
awesome. We are consistent in one

21
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:28,240
thing and one thing only, and it
is having awesome people on our

22
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:28,786
podcast.

23
00:01:29,305 --> 00:01:35,141
Dan: Yes, agreed. Um, so yeah, so
we are starting season six off

24
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:42,521
with. An awesome guest of the
name? David Albert. Uh, David is

25
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:47,021
a director. Um, no, wait, what is
he? I lost it. David is the

26
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:51,971
Director of Engineering, sorry,
at Northfield IT, um, and one of

27
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:56,740
the many Canadians we have in
Virtual Coffee and also on the

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,021
podcast. um, not the first, won't
be the last. Um, and yeah, we had

29
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,686
a really great time talking to
David. Yeah,

30
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:06,835
Bekah: Yeah, David is one of
those conversations that could

31
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:11,126
have continued on for sure.
Beyond the hour. He has so much

32
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:16,165
insight into not just like the
technology field, but in working

33
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:21,116
with other people. And he, I
really appreciated his

34
00:02:21,116 --> 00:02:25,855
thoughtfulness in how he.
Approaches other people and

35
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:26,575
supporting them.

36
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:29,485
Dan: absolutely. That, I mean
like that, that's gotta be one of

37
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:32,980
the first things I think of. When
I think of David is, is yeah.

38
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,020
Thoughtfulness. Um, and, and I
don't know, you know, like

39
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,401
thoughtful and empathetic is, is
what, he's one of the, I mean,

40
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:48,820
he's, he's always on, um, Slack
and he's, I, I dunno, like

41
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,640
everybody loves him. He's always
so great to talk to anytime you,

42
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,711
anytime you're kind of working
through something or have some

43
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,830
existential crisis I feel like
David's one of those, one of

44
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,841
those people that will show up
and, um, You know, like actually

45
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:04,211
have constructive ways to maybe
work through some, some hard

46
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:06,312
problems and stuff. It's it's
really, it's really nice having

47
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:06,973
him around

48
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:11,950
Bekah: yeah. And, and the, that
empathy that he brings to the

49
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:19,181
situation is really, um,
Authentic and true, you know, is

50
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:22,121
somebody might check in and see
how you're doing, but, you know,

51
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:25,781
if you get a message from David,
he means that. And I think that

52
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:29,381
goes a long way to supporting
people and helping them feel

53
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:34,300
comfortable and allowing them to,
you know, grow and, and learn in

54
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,651
those ways and support them.

55
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:44,027
Dan: Absolutely. Um, okay. What
is our random question? I, how do

56
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:46,907
we start the episode? This
episode?

57
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:49,473
Bekah: Um,

58
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:51,203
Dan: Oh, totally.

59
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:58,447
Bekah: don't but don't we in the
first episode, intro, talk about

60
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,796
the other guests too.

61
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:06,257
Dan: Uh, I don't know. I haven't
done this for a while.

62
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:10,209
Bekah: We're excited about this
episode and the rest of the

63
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:16,418
season. So we're also going to be
talking to Bogden about

64
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,959
navigating tech career paths. We
have quite a bit of career path

65
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,649
episodes this season. So we're
gonna be learning about what it

66
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:28,872
means to be a demo engineer, a
developer educator, we're gonna

67
00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:32,653
be talking through interviews and
open source contributions. So I

68
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:40,002
think this is a pretty well
rounded season to, I don't know,

69
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:45,192
get you excited about all things.
Am I spinny chair? I've got a

70
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:45,973
spin chair this

71
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,838
Dan: you have. Yes. Bekah got a
spinny chair and she has not

72
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:50,127
stopped spinning. I got

73
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:52,632
Bekah: It is the best thing. I
just continue to spin.

74
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:56,788
Dan: yeah. Yeah. It's it's uh,
well, it is what it is. I feel

75
00:04:56,788 --> 00:05:00,387
like you're doing a good job of,
um, like rotating around your

76
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:03,057
microphone and staying in a good
speaking position

77
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,887
Bekah: Yeah, I'm trying to keep
my head straight on the

78
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:05,908
Dan: well done. Yeah,

79
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:09,747
Bekah: my body turns, but my head
does minimal turning.

80
00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:12,958
Dan: yeah. No, it's you, you're
doing a good job.

81
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:19,192
Bekah: Thanks. That's all I
needed to hear today. but we are

82
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:23,182
going to start this episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

83
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:27,141
episode of the podcast and every
Virtual Coffee, say our name,

84
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:30,831
where we're from, what we do and
answer a random check in

85
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,281
question. So we hope you enjoyed
this episode and the rest of

86
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:45,045
season six. Today's random
check-in question is if you could

87
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:50,055
magically become fluent in any
language, what would it be? My

88
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:55,005
name is Bekah. I am a technical
community builder from a small

89
00:05:55,011 --> 00:06:04,516
town in Ohio, and I think I would
go with Polish only because I'm

90
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:10,170
mostly Polish and I would like to
know more of it. Definitely not

91
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,831
the most practical, but it's
probably the most meaningful.

92
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,709
Dan: All right, Polish.

93
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:18,949
Bekah: Yes. See, that was the
most straightforward I've ever

94
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:19,750
been in an intro.

95
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,910
Dan: Yeah. Um, okay. Hi, I'm Dan.
I do, um, web development things

96
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:32,420
in Cleveland and, um, yeah. Uh, I
don't know, languages are hard.

97
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,870
I, this is a, an attractive
question to me because I I'm bad

98
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,300
at like learning languages. I
took like three years of German

99
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,139
and I struggled with Spanish in
college and I. I took three

100
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,410
German. I don't know. I can still
count to 10, I think, but, um,

101
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,600
you know, Spanish would be, I
think, I think I'm gonna choose

102
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,100
Spanish. I, you know, it just,
it, I, uh, I like going to

103
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,310
Mexican restaurants. like, you
know, there's a lot of Spanish

104
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,269
speaking people, you know, in
America and, um, although, uh,

105
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:03,079
Japanese would be cool too. I, I
love like listening to Japanese,

106
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,769
you know? People speaking
Japanese. I like, I just like the

107
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:09,709
way it sounds. So that'd be cool
too. And, and it's so different

108
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,319
than English that, you know,
that's one, that's really hard

109
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:15,920
for me to wrap my head around
ever being able to speak. Uh, so

110
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,470
I'm, I'm kind of tied 50, 50
Spanish and Japanese. That's

111
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,069
gonna be my answer.

112
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:24,675
David: Well, since Dan said to
you, I'm gonna say to you, uh, my

113
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:29,415
name is David Albert, and I'm,
I'm a software developer and

114
00:07:29,444 --> 00:07:36,019
DevOps engineer. uh, in Winnipeg,
Manitoba, and I was having a hard

115
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:40,310
time picking just one. So since
Dan set the example, my first

116
00:07:40,314 --> 00:07:43,189
thought was Indonesian because I
spent some time in Indonesia and

117
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:47,779
I remember just enough Indonesian
to say some things to Ayu, for

118
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:51,560
example, in our community. But
I'm no by no means fluent. And it

119
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,910
would just be so much fun to be
fluent again or more in

120
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,064
Indonesian. But then. Bekah when
you mentioned Polish. I, I

121
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:03,185
thought Hebrew because that would
connect me with some of my family

122
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:06,904
and some of my tradition, so that
I've drifted a little bit from so

123
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:09,125
Hebrew and Indonesian

124
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:10,415
Dan: I like it.

125
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:10,774
David: will.

126
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,709
Bekah: Yeah, thanks, David.
Normally I, I ask our guests to

127
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:18,529
choose one thing and then I
choose four or five. So

128
00:08:19,894 --> 00:08:21,175
David: So we turned the tables
today.

129
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:25,339
Bekah: um, welcome to the
podcast. Thanks so much for being

130
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:29,779
here with us today. We always
like to start with the origin

131
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:33,649
story of our guests. So tell us a
little bit about your origin

132
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,840
story and how that brought you to
where you are.

133
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,770
David: I was thinking about this
question. I love that you start

134
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,780
with the origin story and the way
you frame it as origin, I. I can

135
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,030
remember using the Logo computer
language to make the little

136
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:58,130
turtle draw back and forth. I
don't remember a lot about it,

137
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,181
but I remember being really
excited when I discovered loops

138
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:04,431
and I didn't even know they were
called loops, but I could draw

139
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:09,816
flowers with not very much. Uh,
code. So that was pretty

140
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:15,365
exciting. And then I went to, you
know, high school and grew up and

141
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:19,775
lots of things happened. Uh, I
went to university and took a

142
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:22,775
computer science degree. I wound
up taking a computer science

143
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:26,736
degree and that taught me a lot
of fundamentals about mentals,

144
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:30,905
about computer architecture, say,
and like hardware architecture.

145
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:33,456
There was a computer engineering
course in there too. And also

146
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:38,166
basics. Data structures and
algorithms. So I feel like I got

147
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:43,385
a leg up on that before there was
any of the, now all the code

148
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,755
camps and everything, the free
code camps and the flat iron

149
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:48,485
school and everything that I hear
about all the resources that are

150
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:53,556
available today. I didn't have
those back at that time. So, but

151
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:56,615
I was fortunate enough to be able
to go to this university program.

152
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,765
And I studied not only computer
science, but also it was kind of

153
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,426
a liberal artsy program. And I
got exposed to all sorts of.

154
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,591
Things that were not technical in
the world. And I got very

155
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:08,961
distracted and I didn't want
anything to do with technology

156
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:12,620
and I wanted to go find something
more meaningful to do. So I went

157
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,990
and I traveled and that's when I
wound up in Indonesia with an

158
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,711
exchange program with, uh,
Canadian, crossroads

159
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:22,341
international, a cultural
exchange program, designed to

160
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:28,640
expose people to different
cultures. And as I was proceeding

161
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,086
with my life, I noticed a common
thread. I would constantly notice

162
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:38,196
that people around me that I
cared about friends, family would

163
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:43,145
be stressed or unhappy with
technology and they would be

164
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:46,355
frustrated and they would start
to internalize it like, oh, I'm

165
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:49,326
not good at this. Or I must not
be very smart because I can't

166
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:53,105
figure this out. And I would look
at what they were struggling

167
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:58,086
with. And I was frustrated. I got
frustrated because it wa I knew

168
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:02,691
enough about technology to know.
Didn't have to be that way. And

169
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:06,980
that what my friends and family
were struggling with was design

170
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,770
decisions that somebody had made
that hadn't really thought about

171
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,370
how they would land on a real
person. And that's really what

172
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,961
prompted me to get back into
technology. Um, and from there

173
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:21,051
I've done a number of technology,
jobs, technology related jobs,

174
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:25,941
uh, web front end. Now we would
call it front end, develop. at

175
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:29,750
the time I was starting to learn
about front end engineering. And

176
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,041
that was back when I remember
before Firebug was introduced,

177
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,591
like back before Chrome dev
tools. And then Firebug was a

178
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:40,100
really big deal, Jay Qury and
Firebug changed the way we did

179
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:42,110
web development back then.

180
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:42,910
Dan: Yeah, it did.

181
00:11:43,341 --> 00:11:48,650
David: Um, and now, well, from,
from there, I got tired of front

182
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,571
end and I got interested in
backend. So I went and did

183
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:53,211
backend. I did a lot of C sharp.
I did years and years of C sharp.

184
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:57,426
In fact, I found recently a
commit somewhere in GitHub from

185
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,785
16 years ago that I did in C
sharps. I've been writing code

186
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:01,446
for a long time.

187
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:02,826
Dan: that's awesome.

188
00:12:03,426 --> 00:12:06,846
David: And from there, I went to
various software developer jobs

189
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:10,655
and took some project management
training, got involved in the

190
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:17,436
local Winnipeg, agile community
and found my way into builds and

191
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:22,296
deploys. And that's what got me
into DevOps. And now here I.

192
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,071
Bekah: That's I was gonna say
great, but.

193
00:12:28,191 --> 00:12:32,120
Dan: Oh, it's great. It is great
also. It's great and awesome. Um,

194
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,230
no, that, that's a cool that's. I
love having people on. I mean, I

195
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,051
love having all, I guests it's,
it's always fun for me having

196
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,961
people on who started, uh, like
when you started, when I, you

197
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:44,480
know, back a long time ago, I, I
logo hadn't thought about for a

198
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:47,061
long time. I, I definitely did
Logo in like the computer lab in,

199
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:51,681
uh, in middle school. Um, What I
was, I had a question for you.

200
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:54,350
What was it? Oh, it was, um,
okay, so you mentioned like,

201
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,441
right, like learning fundamentals
and learning computer science

202
00:12:57,441 --> 00:13:01,250
stuff, sort of maybe a, I don't
know what the hard computer

203
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,880
science, uh, I dunno what a good
term is for it, but you know,

204
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,181
the, the kind of stuff that at
least back in the day you learned

205
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:12,110
in computer science courses in
college, right. Versus, uh,

206
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:16,025
today. Where there's so many
different, like places to go so

207
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:19,025
many different ways to learn so
many different, um, approaches to

208
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:22,446
learning even. Uh, and I guess
the thought that I had was, um,

209
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:26,225
what do you think, like, can you
imagine trying to learn from

210
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,250
scratch now and would you want
to. If you were starting over

211
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,071
right now. Right. But you have
all the stuff available. Would

212
00:13:34,071 --> 00:13:38,000
you rather go that fundamentals
level and learning stuff probably

213
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:41,331
in languages that you're never
going to use in, you know, in, in

214
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:44,301
practical levels, but you're
getting all the fundamental stuff

215
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,400
or would you like there's boot
bootstrap, no boot camps, sorry.

216
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,931
Uh, boot camps and everything
like that. That. Will put you

217
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:56,870
more in a practical place to, to
get, you know, where, where

218
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,030
you're learning some JavaScripts
and learning React and stuff like

219
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,770
that, even before, you know, um,
maybe some of the more esoteric

220
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,010
pieces of computer science, you
know? Um, and so this is not a,

221
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,291
like, I'm not asking you to like,
place judgment on anything, but

222
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,451
just like from a personal
personal standpoint, like where,

223
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,211
where do you, like, where would
you land? Like where would you

224
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,230
personally rather, uh, start, if
you could start, if you were

225
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,370
starting from scratch, you know,
now.

226
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:21,995
David: This is a really good
question, Dan. And it's come up a

227
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,426
number of times in Virtual
Coffee, because we have a number

228
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:28,355
of people who are career changers
or, or early career people in

229
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:31,326
the, in the community. And
they're constantly wondering what

230
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:35,346
do I do next? And what do I look,
um, the way you phrased it

231
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:41,556
though, for me, if I were to
start now, I, one of the things I

232
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:45,995
notice about the technical
landscape today compared to when

233
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:50,916
I started is it seems to have
exploded in technologies and

234
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:55,505
frameworks and libraries and
possibilities. And I think it

235
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:00,365
would, I would lean towards
practical first because I think

236
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:06,801
that would help me. Learn enough
about one thing to start to work.

237
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:11,211
And really once you get into,
once you cross that difficult

238
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:14,331
barrier of finding your first job
in technology, then you can get

239
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:20,780
paid to learn as you work. And,
and then you can, I don't know,

240
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:26,105
maybe. I think it would be
worthwhile to take some survey

241
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:30,035
course of the fundamentals, some
high level survey course so that

242
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:34,296
you introduce the, or you you're
introduced to the words and

243
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:38,706
phrases, because I find that the
computer science degree helps me

244
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:42,066
in two ways. One that having
those fundamentals. Often helps

245
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,605
me understand new frameworks, cuz
I kind of understand how

246
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:50,375
computers work underneath and all
of the languages and frameworks.

247
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,255
So learning any particular
practical framework gets, I think

248
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:55,115
easier with that fundamental
background,

249
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:56,436
Dan: Yeah.

250
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:59,735
David: think it's required to
learn how to work in any of those

251
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:02,885
things. I just think that it
helps me. The other place I

252
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:06,186
notice is that it helps me in
searching for things. When I go

253
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:10,686
to Google sometimes. The terms
and the phrases, I think I'm

254
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:14,586
drawing from that training back
then. So that's where I think

255
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:17,885
maybe a survey course without
having to go deep in all those

256
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:20,796
things, because you, I only
remember the things that I use

257
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:26,946
and we joke. I mean, we work in,
in DevOps where, uh, cashing is a

258
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:30,426
thing, you know, one of the, the
two hard problems in computer

259
00:16:30,426 --> 00:16:35,975
science, right? Yeah. Um, And we
joke about my memory only holds

260
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:39,966
so much and I expire things for
my mental cash. When I go and

261
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:43,355
learn something new. Um, you
know, you ask me a question about

262
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:45,905
something that I supposedly
studied and I have a cash miss,

263
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:49,355
and I have to go look it up, but
I do find that things that I have

264
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:54,125
learned and then purged often
come back easier or more easily.

265
00:16:55,086 --> 00:16:58,056
That's a long winded way of to
say I would start practical today

266
00:16:58,056 --> 00:17:01,326
because there's so many
widespread things. I think it

267
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:04,476
would take a long time to go from
fundamentals to something

268
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,925
practical today. But I think if
you start today with something

269
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:12,096
practical, you could, but maybe
just a quick survey of you don't

270
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:14,855
need to understand all the data
structures and algorithms, but

271
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:19,925
like, if you can name three of
them, cuz you know, they exist,

272
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:22,536
then you can search up
implementations of them or

273
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:23,945
details about them when you need.

274
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:24,681
Dan: Yeah.

275
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:25,191
Bekah: good idea.

276
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,010
Dan: Oh, I think that, I love
that answer. I, you know, and I

277
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:30,830
think I tend to agree with you. I
per, I mean, also personally, I,

278
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:36,050
I got interested in computer
development stuff because of the.

279
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,770
Like logo, you know, seeing
something happen right away, you

280
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,050
know, like hitting, save, and
then like looking at it and, you

281
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,921
know, whatever. Um, and
sometimes, or writing code on a

282
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:50,030
chalkboard and stuff like that is
like, uh, was I drifted away from

283
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,411
it in college? Um, because, um, I
was computer science major to

284
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:57,441
start as well. And you know, it,
it just got less and less, less

285
00:17:57,441 --> 00:18:00,711
and less like fun, you know, I
dunno, but you're right. Like the

286
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:07,010
knowing the like, For instance,
um, the big O notation, right?

287
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,851
Like analyzing how a, how long a
function takes to do a thing. You

288
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:13,760
know, I don't think anybody
that's writing rack code for

289
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,340
their job needs to know the names
of all the different, you know,

290
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:21,651
or even like, they don't need to
know the, even the phrase big O

291
00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:25,671
right. But knowing that will help
you will help you sort of think

292
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:29,691
through and go like, like, uh,
having that in your brain would,

293
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,681
um, In the background and it's
okay if it's expired cash, but

294
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:35,990
you'll still like, see something
and start like, it's like code

295
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,961
smell, kind of, you know, uh,
it's like a weird phrase, but

296
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:40,760
like a phrase that makes a lot of
sense to people who have been

297
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,401
doing it for a while is, is
you'll start to get like these

298
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:46,881
instincts or whatever these like
it's okay. If you don't know the

299
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:49,671
exact phrase or I don't remember
the exact name of some specific

300
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:54,020
algorithm or anything like that,
but okay. I know just sort of

301
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,871
almost intuitively that this
thing is going to take like way

302
00:18:56,871 --> 00:19:00,530
longer. Than it should. And I
probably can do it a different,

303
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,931
different way, you know, that,
that sort of thing. I think

304
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:05,211
that's the sort of thing that
would hit on your idea of the,

305
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:08,961
um, like doing, doing a high
level, you know, um, survey

306
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:10,881
course, something like that.
You'll get exposed to some of

307
00:19:10,885 --> 00:19:14,151
that stuff, even if, and you
don't need to know like the down

308
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:15,080
and dirty details, you know,

309
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:20,645
David: Even if we take something
that is like computer sciencey,

310
00:19:20,796 --> 00:19:27,980
heavy, like big O notation, it's
very, almost theoretical or a. An

311
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,980
academic, like it's a very
academic way to approach this

312
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,570
technology thing. Not a very
practical way, but knowing that,

313
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,530
like being able to like knowing
that something called big O

314
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,760
notation exists, being able to
have one sentence about it will

315
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:49,701
help you identify when it might
be. Um, In like a part of the

316
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:52,941
problem you're dealing with and
give you enough words to go and

317
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,851
Google the details of how it
intersects with the problem

318
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:59,691
you're with. And you don't need
to be able to explain it in

319
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:00,711
detail or,

320
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:01,836
Dan: Right.

321
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:04,401
David: you know what I mean? So
just knowing that it's a thing or

322
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:07,461
knowing that cashing is a thing
without knowing how cashing works

323
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:13,941
or knowing that I Don. The one
that came to mind as you were

324
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:18,830
talking, is that string conation
is expensive in sea sharp for

325
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,750
whatever reason, because strings
are immutable in C sharp, they're

326
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,540
treated as immutable objects. So
every time you're joining strings

327
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,230
together, you're allocating extra
memory and copying everything

328
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:35,030
over. So it's a very expensive
operation that detail of C sharp

329
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,641
would never have stuck for me. I
don't think if I didn't know a

330
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:40,101
little bit of fundamentals about
how memory allocation.

331
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,871
Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

332
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:47,395
Bekah: I think too, once you are
working, you you're coding more

333
00:20:47,395 --> 00:20:51,236
rather than you're learning those
concepts become easier to

334
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:54,955
understand, because if you're
learning, they, they are kind of

335
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:59,185
theoretical, right? Because you
have no use to apply them. Or if

336
00:20:59,185 --> 00:21:02,486
you are building a project for a
bootcamp or something, it's a

337
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:07,891
tiny little project. So it
doesn't exactly. Correlate much,

338
00:21:07,951 --> 00:21:11,520
much of that stuff with what
you're doing. So when you have

339
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,611
that like practical application
and you're learning that like,

340
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:19,740
oh, okay, I understand where this
would be applied or where I would

341
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:23,941
need to reference this idea. And
at least for me, it becomes a

342
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:28,800
little bit easier once I can see
all right. Th this is where we

343
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,911
need to think about this.

344
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:34,431
David: This, this goes to my
understanding of how we learn as

345
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:38,000
humans. Like we learn better when
there's emotion involved. We

346
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,361
learn better when there's motion
involved, we learn better when we

347
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:47,855
have real experience to hang
ideas off of. And that just makes

348
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:51,846
intuitive sense to me. That also
is why I say go practical and

349
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:55,536
learn just enough theory to have
language, to know when you need

350
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:56,586
to go deeper.

351
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:02,736
Bekah: So like writing down, I,
you just gave me a new talk idea

352
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,605
and the title has to be like
motion and emotion and it's has

353
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:09,455
something to do with learning,
because I think both of those

354
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:13,746
things are, you know, does tie it
to our memory. It does allow us

355
00:22:13,806 --> 00:22:17,405
to connect with it in a different
way. And I know that there are

356
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:19,685
people out there. There were
people when I was learning that

357
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:23,306
said, well, you have to. Um,
learn how to think higher level

358
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:26,635
and theoretically, and how to
apply that. And I don't, I mean,

359
00:22:26,726 --> 00:22:31,766
my background, I taught college
English for 10 years and so I, I

360
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:35,066
can think theoretically, uh, it's
something that I had to do, but I

361
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:41,185
don't think that we have to do
that. You know? Um, I, I think

362
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:44,306
that that's a little bit gate
keep.

363
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,691
David: and, and it also
presupposes that there's only one

364
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:54,681
way to learn and only one way to
think. And, and that seems to be

365
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:59,090
an idea that was stronger years
ago. And now we know better one

366
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,911
of those ideas. Now we recognize
that there's a whole spectrum of

367
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:06,020
how people think and process
information and learn and, uh,

368
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,931
view and interact with the world
and experience the world.

369
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:12,921
Bekah: And you have a lot of
experience with this, especially

370
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:16,461
at Virtual Coffee for our
listeners who aren't in the

371
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:20,240
slack. We have a co-working room
where anybody can join at any

372
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,230
time. And it's an open zoom room
and sometimes people are there to

373
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,351
hang out. Sometimes people have
questions and they jump into

374
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:32,570
pair. And David is one of our,
our top co-working room

375
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,500
attendees, I think. And you've
helped a lot of different people

376
00:23:36,506 --> 00:23:39,945
in the co-working room. So like,
first of all, Thank you. And

377
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:42,855
second of all, you know, this all
ties into what we've been talking

378
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:46,006
about. How do you kind of
approach people who come in and

379
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:49,875
have questions, because there are
so many different ways of, you

380
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:50,895
know, talking through things and

381
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:54,171
David: Oh, my gosh. Well, thank
you. I love the co-working room

382
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:57,411
is one of my favorite parts of co
of Virtual Coffee and this

383
00:23:57,411 --> 00:24:02,151
community that you've created.
Um, I never know what's gonna

384
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:04,221
happen when I go in there, but I
always know it's gonna be

385
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:07,790
friendly and friendly faces and
in the middle of a pandemic,

386
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:10,881
certainly when I was locked in my
room, it was a lifesaver to be

387
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:15,635
able to dial it like walking
virtually into a room. And meet

388
00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:20,346
friendly people. And, uh, one of
my favorite co-working room

389
00:24:20,346 --> 00:24:23,645
memories is I, you know, often
you go in and there's people who

390
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:26,016
are not sharing a screen and
they're just talking. Or

391
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:30,276
sometimes I go in and there's
people who are all on mute and

392
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:35,256
just enjoying being together. And
other times I, I logged in once

393
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:39,695
and Meg had her laptop on her
front porch and she was garden. I

394
00:24:39,701 --> 00:24:44,256
logged in another time and Orlie
was, uh, making crepes in her

395
00:24:44,256 --> 00:24:48,215
kitchen. Like it was lovely. So
it blew open for me that this was

396
00:24:48,215 --> 00:24:51,935
really a, a place where people
could connect, which is at the

397
00:24:51,935 --> 00:24:57,846
heart of this community. Um, but
to focus back, you asked about

398
00:24:57,846 --> 00:25:04,701
how do I approach. Pairing or
working with people from lots of

399
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:06,980
different backgrounds on lots of
different technology? Well, some

400
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,280
of it is cuz I've been doing this
for a long time, so I've seen a

401
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,861
bunch of things. Um, I, some of
it is that I'm in a job where I'm

402
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:19,875
actively working in several
different languages. Um, and I'm

403
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:23,925
in a job where I'm working to
support developers. So for five

404
00:25:23,925 --> 00:25:26,955
years, that's really been my
role. And even Bekah the other

405
00:25:26,955 --> 00:25:29,476
day you were talking about devel
and I realized some of what I've

406
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:33,465
been doing falls under that
bucket of really looking for ways

407
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:38,355
to help people who are having
problems. And I find there are

408
00:25:38,355 --> 00:25:43,905
some common threads, like a lot
of it is really slowing down my

409
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:48,050
thought process to take the time
to meet somebody. In their

410
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:54,381
thought process as best I can to
really try to hear not what I

411
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:58,340
think the problem is, but try to
hear what someone else thinks the

412
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,451
problem is, and try to look at it
from their point of view, as best

413
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:07,101
I can and try to look with them
at whatever they're looking at.

414
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:09,441
So I will often say if you're
having trouble, can you share an

415
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:12,951
error message or can we share a
screen? And I can look at the

416
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:18,590
same thing you are because words.
Becoming adequate for talking

417
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,310
about technical things. English
words in particular are so

418
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,000
imprecise sometimes that we can
say the same word and mean

419
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,540
different things. So I often find
it really useful to share, um, a

420
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:36,080
screen and pair program and look
at the look at the same thing at

421
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:42,230
the same time, or to share a
stack trace or a, you know, the,

422
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:47,181
an error message. Uh, that's
really. I think I've drifted from

423
00:26:47,361 --> 00:26:48,351
the heart of your question

424
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,151
Bekah: I mean, I think it's
great. I mean, you're really

425
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:54,441
taking a person-centered approach
to each person that comes into

426
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:58,550
that room. And the idea of like
listening and understanding is

427
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,601
something that I, I think a lot
of people struggle, struggle with

428
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:05,451
myself included because it's
like, all right, let's just dive

429
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:10,340
into this. Right. And get going
without like, taking that time to

430
00:27:10,401 --> 00:27:12,800
understand what's happening with
the other person.

431
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:20,810
David: I really think that's
important. Um, at some point in

432
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:27,185
my growth. career. I discovered
the agile manifesto and people

433
00:27:27,215 --> 00:27:30,185
have I've since read lots of
things, you know, positive and

434
00:27:30,185 --> 00:27:33,546
not so positive about the agile
manifesto. And I don't mean to go

435
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:38,346
down that rabbit hole, but the
first value statement really

436
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:42,125
stuck and resonated with me that
we value people and relationships

437
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:49,101
over processes and things. That
is kind of a radical idea. if

438
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:52,401
you, if you take that and nothing
else that we value people in

439
00:27:52,401 --> 00:27:56,270
relationships over attachment to
any particular way of doing

440
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:00,770
things and you start there and
you really look to meet the other

441
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,351
people that you're working with,
no matter what their role is, no

442
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:06,471
matter what their background is
and realize that we're all part

443
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:09,621
of a group or a team or a
community that's trying to

444
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:14,796
accomplish something together. I
think all of the other practices

445
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:19,266
around software development and
delivery can emerge. If you start

446
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:22,625
with who's at the table and you
really make space for everybody

447
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:25,655
who's at the table. And that
could be a hard thing, cuz we're

448
00:28:25,655 --> 00:28:27,846
not always used to doing that.
There is a lot of gate keep E

449
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:33,905
like language and habits in
technology. I try to do my part

450
00:28:33,905 --> 00:28:35,346
to break that stuff down.

451
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:39,336
Bekah: Yeah, I think a lot of
times too, sometimes it's

452
00:28:39,336 --> 00:28:42,996
certainly intentional and other
times it's not, it's, it's just

453
00:28:43,115 --> 00:28:48,066
habits that have built up, uh,
personally or through careers or

454
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:51,875
with the teams that you have
worked on before. So, you know,

455
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:57,215
there's a, a need for constantly
evaluating ourselves and how we

456
00:28:57,665 --> 00:29:00,786
approach the people that we are
talking to or working.

457
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:11,871
David: that. Pairing really well
takes time, takes me time. I have

458
00:29:11,871 --> 00:29:15,651
to really slow down and let go of
any pressure and really be

459
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:19,461
present with another person. And
that takes time and energy and

460
00:29:19,461 --> 00:29:24,711
effort. And if I'm under a
deadline to deliver something, it

461
00:29:24,711 --> 00:29:29,510
can be challenging to make that
time and that pressure, but I

462
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:35,556
think it is so worth it to.
Balance individual contribution

463
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:39,756
and individual delivery and
individual speed with all of the

464
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:43,266
rich benefits you get from
building community as you work

465
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:45,905
and from building relationships
and sharing knowledge and

466
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:49,925
building experience and
supporting everybody to grow in

467
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:55,145
confidence and skill. Um, there's
so many benefits from actually

468
00:29:55,145 --> 00:29:55,955
working together.

469
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:59,961
Bekah: Absolutely. And next
month, our monthly challenge,

470
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:05,181
this will be in June is month of
feedback. And so we read radical

471
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:08,030
candor. I we've mentioned it so
many times. Uh, it's been a

472
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,090
favorite of ours, but when you're
working with so many different

473
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:15,320
people, you are providing a lot
of feedback and that can be hard

474
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,701
sometimes, right? Because that
feedback has to be critical. How

475
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:25,435
do you approach. Giving honest
feedback, but still supporting

476
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:28,375
the person that you are providing
the feedback to.

477
00:30:29,855 --> 00:30:33,036
David: That's a great question. I
started reading radical candor

478
00:30:33,276 --> 00:30:37,056
with someone on my team because
you have talked about it so much.

479
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:47,480
Um, and it is the, I struggle a
bit with the directness. Of

480
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,230
critical feedback. That's where I
found that book was really useful

481
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,411
in giving me some examples of how
to be direct without being

482
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:58,161
confrontational, right. And to
stay heart centered, to stay

483
00:30:58,161 --> 00:31:01,431
person centered and to really
have the other persons to be

484
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:07,665
committed to the other person. I
find I really practice. The idea

485
00:31:07,756 --> 00:31:10,125
what practice, which means I'm
not always good at it, but I work

486
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:17,536
at it. I practice the idea that
everybody is where they're at on

487
00:31:17,536 --> 00:31:20,655
their own personal journey. And
everybody is right where they're

488
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:25,905
supposed to be in the moment. And
exactly the people that show up

489
00:31:25,905 --> 00:31:28,786
are the people who are supposed
to be there. And the people who

490
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,766
are on your team are the people
who are supposed to be there.

491
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:36,090
Like really try to embrace. And
accept and love what's happening.

492
00:31:36,451 --> 00:31:42,931
I think that's really important,
um, to be more practical though,

493
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:49,500
I find still I'm noticing a lot
of self-doubt and self-criticism

494
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,921
that happens in technology. And
so one of the things that I

495
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:57,030
really try to do when I'm pairing
is be encouraging above all else

496
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:01,425
to be supportive and encouraging.
Because the biggest thing that I

497
00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:03,855
believe will help people learn is
to grow that confidence, that

498
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,496
it's okay to make a mistake. It's
okay. Not to know something

499
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:09,615
that's actually part of the job
and the faster that you are

500
00:32:09,615 --> 00:32:13,726
honest and open about what you
don't know as well as what, you

501
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:17,236
know, then the faster that
everybody can see how to help you

502
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:22,036
and the faster you can learn. And
so I really just try to always

503
00:32:22,036 --> 00:32:26,236
try to be supportive and patient
and. Guide people towards what

504
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,576
seems to be the next step so that
they can build their

505
00:32:28,576 --> 00:32:31,365
understanding and get stronger
and bigger because that kind of

506
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:35,566
pairing and feedback and support.
It's not about me in that moment.

507
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:39,615
It's really about trying to work
with somebody and support them to

508
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:43,215
take, uh, whatever the next step
is for them. And if I'm deciding

509
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:49,185
what it is, then that's not
right. What I do sometimes

510
00:32:49,185 --> 00:32:52,965
though, is I might point people
in a direction based on the

511
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:55,951
journey that I've walked. I might
say. You know, have you thought

512
00:32:55,951 --> 00:32:59,371
about this or let's go look at
that or I'd like, yeah, I do more

513
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:02,490
direct coaching sometimes with
people on my team at work where I

514
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,300
say, I'd like you to learn this,
or I'd like you to learn that,

515
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:11,671
um, you know, in that context I
feel like there's a framework and

516
00:33:11,675 --> 00:33:13,651
it's part of my role and
responsibility to be more

517
00:33:13,651 --> 00:33:18,211
directive. But I still try to
partner with people always to

518
00:33:18,211 --> 00:33:22,111
say, There's what you want to
learn and what you're interested

519
00:33:22,111 --> 00:33:25,171
in. And there's what I see as an
opportunity for you. And let's

520
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:30,030
bring those together and make out
a plan. Um, it

521
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:30,480
Bekah: that.

522
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:31,230
David: yeah.

523
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:34,471
Bekah: I was just gonna say,
acknowledging the person where

524
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:37,711
they're at on the journey is a
huge part of that. And, and what

525
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:42,121
your relationship is with that
person, because for sure, we

526
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:45,570
communicate differently with
people we've been working with

527
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,441
for a while or somebody who's new
on the team or someone we're

528
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:53,250
meeting for the first time. You
know, all of these things play a

529
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,971
role into, I think, how we
provide feedback and what the

530
00:33:56,971 --> 00:34:03,780
expectations are. Of us, you
know, if I, um, am responding to

531
00:34:03,786 --> 00:34:07,141
a student's paper, there's an
expectation of how I'll respond

532
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:10,081
to that paper. Versus if somebody
says, Hey, can you give me

533
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:13,561
feedback on my blog post? It's
going to be a little bit

534
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:16,561
different. I'm going to provide
feedback either way, but the tone

535
00:34:16,561 --> 00:34:18,030
is going to change for sure.

536
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:22,445
David: But through it, all that
concept of people and

537
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:26,221
relationships first is really
important. Like. And that's what

538
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:30,331
I have enjoyed about the part of
radical candor that I've managed

539
00:34:30,331 --> 00:34:33,721
to read so far is that it does
start with that people centered

540
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:40,260
approach and that, um, valuing
the person that you're giving

541
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,710
feedback to you and valuing the
relationship for what it is not

542
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,740
needing to make it something that
it isn't in whatever context, but

543
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:51,331
valuing it for what it is. And.
Valuing that the other person

544
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,170
involved is a human on a journey.
Just like you're a human on a

545
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:59,791
journey. And, you know, there was
a time when I didn't know what I

546
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:02,581
was doing and people were
gracious with me. So I tried to

547
00:35:02,581 --> 00:35:06,391
return that favor, pay it forward
in that sense.

548
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:12,690
Dan: and I I'd say another,
another, um, Another piece of

549
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,501
this is, um, you know, when you
talk about meeting people where

550
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:19,920
they are and things like that,
um, it helps when you know them

551
00:35:20,431 --> 00:35:24,300
already, right. It's easier to
have, uh, connections when you,

552
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,101
well, I was gonna say when you
are connected, I don't know. I

553
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:31,050
dunno that sentence kind of broke
down in the middle there, but,

554
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,681
uh, I was thinking about two
things. When, when you were

555
00:35:34,681 --> 00:35:39,016
talking something Bekah and I
worked together. Don't know why I

556
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:43,096
brought this up, but Bekah and I
worked together. Um, and it took

557
00:35:43,096 --> 00:35:45,556
us, I dunno. How long do you
think it took us before? I mean,

558
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:47,686
at least a year or something
before we were really like,

559
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:50,460
Bekah: I feel like right before
the pandemic hit, we were like

560
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,940
eight months in and we, like, we
finally hit that stride. And

561
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,570
then, and then

562
00:35:55,666 --> 00:36:00,900
Dan: yeah. And, and some of, and
some of that is like, um, Some of

563
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,490
it is me, you know, so Bekah had
just started in like in dev and

564
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,101
had just kind of gotten outta
bootcamp and stuff. And so some

565
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:10,621
of it was me like learning how to
do that better, you know,

566
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:13,681
learning to do all the stuff that
David's just talking about. Um,

567
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:18,181
and some of it I think is, um, is
just that connection over time,

568
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:21,210
you know, kind of just grows and
grows stronger. Um, and that's

569
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:25,260
another thing I appreciate about
Virtual Coffee and, and I think

570
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,590
it helps is, um, when you know,
people, you know, it's, it's,

571
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:35,280
it's a little bit. Um, easier to
do this I guess, and to get

572
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,800
practice at it when you know, a
person. And so, so you don't have

573
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,760
to maybe necessarily, um, like I,
when I pair with somebody I've

574
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,161
paired with people, you know,
kind of cold, right. So people, I

575
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,530
don't know. And, um, for the
first time, and there's always a

576
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,681
bit of like level setting, you
know, and I, and I, I try to be

577
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:52,351
very, I mean, I, I wanna be very
careful about it and I, you know,

578
00:36:52,356 --> 00:36:57,510
it's like, you don't wanna assume
that they. That a person knows

579
00:36:57,661 --> 00:36:59,641
things that they don't know. You
don't not assume that they don't

580
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:03,090
know anything either. Right. And
so it's that like, it's that, um,

581
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,931
I, I just, I go level setting cuz
I'm like, and I've now I've just

582
00:37:06,936 --> 00:37:11,041
started explicit doing it. Like,
I, I wanna be very like clear

583
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,471
that I'm, you know, I, I just
wanna figure out where we are,

584
00:37:13,476 --> 00:37:16,590
you know, where you are, where,
where, like what level I can talk

585
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,590
at, you know? Um, and it's,
there's no judgment at, you know,

586
00:37:19,621 --> 00:37:24,690
um, it's just. It's just somebody
who's just learning for the first

587
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,641
time is gonna have different
questions and different thought

588
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:30,931
processes than somebody who maybe
is a Ruby expert, but is just

589
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:33,001
starting a JavaScript. That
person is gonna have completely

590
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:37,170
different questions, you know?
Uh, you know, and, and so it's

591
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,320
always, um, I don't know. It's
always kind of interesting to

592
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,621
when you're connecting with
different people. So when you

593
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:46,471
have a, when you're at work and
you're a team, kind of, you build

594
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:52,936
a rapport over, over time. Right.
And, uh, when you. In a lot of

595
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:56,175
random internet communities, you
can still be valuable and you can

596
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:58,335
still have valuable connections
with people you don't know. Uh,

597
00:37:58,755 --> 00:37:59,295
for sure,

598
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:03,090
David: Well, this overlaps, I
think, with, uh, with you were

599
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:06,885
talking about Bekah and that
Deval. Uh, session you gave the

600
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,315
other day, too, that there's a
part of community building and a

601
00:38:09,315 --> 00:38:16,215
part of developer relations that
is going out and reaching out to

602
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:19,065
people that are not yet a part of
the community and trying to

603
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:24,465
create an opening connection, uh,
with somebody that you don't

604
00:38:24,465 --> 00:38:28,876
know. Um, Dan, as you were
talking, I'm reminded that one of

605
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:32,295
the things that constantly
surprises me still years later,

606
00:38:32,565 --> 00:38:36,045
when I about software development
is how long it takes to get

607
00:38:36,045 --> 00:38:40,695
started with new people.
Especially with new people. When

608
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:44,445
I sit down to pair with a new
person, say a new person joins my

609
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:46,965
team, or I'm in the co-working
room for the first time with

610
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:53,010
somebody new. it's not
unreasonable to take one to three

611
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:58,530
hours to just set out your
machines to work in this a

612
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:02,971
compatible way and set up your
language. Like you were talking

613
00:39:02,971 --> 00:39:08,851
about to figure out what level of
detail and abstraction to speak.

614
00:39:09,675 --> 00:39:13,666
And hear each other and to
develop a common understanding of

615
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:17,476
the problem and to work through
build and compile issues in a new

616
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:22,005
environment, like all these
things that are not typing that

617
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:26,056
are not reading and writing code
become really, really important

618
00:39:26,356 --> 00:39:31,155
and take real time when you care
about the relationships of the

619
00:39:31,155 --> 00:39:34,905
people you're working with. And
I'm constantly surprised by, you

620
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:40,936
know, how little I get D how
little. Progress we make in the

621
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:45,585
code. When I sit down to pair
with people at work, say for the

622
00:39:45,585 --> 00:39:50,536
first time and how much time it
takes to build that initial

623
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:53,925
rapport and common ground and
common language and common

624
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:57,286
environment. And the reason I
keep talking about it here is cuz

625
00:39:57,315 --> 00:40:00,226
I really want to normalize it for
anybody who's listening. If you

626
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:04,005
try pair programming and you sit
down with another human, expect

627
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:06,826
it to be awkward at first.

628
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:07,951
Dan: Yeah.

629
00:40:08,326 --> 00:40:10,726
David: will be and that's okay.
That doesn't mean you're doing it

630
00:40:10,726 --> 00:40:13,275
wrong. And that doesn't mean
you're failing it that's part.

631
00:40:13,306 --> 00:40:16,666
That means it's working. That's
part of figuring out how to work

632
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:19,936
together with another human. And
it does, it's like any other

633
00:40:19,936 --> 00:40:24,195
muscle or skill. It does get
easier over time. Dan, you spoke

634
00:40:24,201 --> 00:40:27,525
about, you know, you you're
working to get better at how to

635
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:31,545
ask those questions more
directly. How to figure out and

636
00:40:31,545 --> 00:40:35,896
navigate that awkwardness faster.
I, I, I feel like I can navigate

637
00:40:35,896 --> 00:40:36,766
it faster now than

638
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:39,166
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. Um, yeah.

639
00:40:39,766 --> 00:40:43,396
Bekah: You know, coming from the
other perspective, like it's,

640
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:47,235
it's a two way conversation,
right? And so when you're first

641
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,686
starting out, it can be really
hard to ask those questions. And

642
00:40:50,686 --> 00:40:53,146
if there's anything, I feel like
I've learned over the last couple

643
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:56,715
of years, it's ask those
questions, whether or not you

644
00:40:56,715 --> 00:41:01,635
think it's gonna make you sound
ridiculous or incapable, you're

645
00:41:01,635 --> 00:41:06,226
going to learn and grow faster
that way. And so. You know,

646
00:41:06,556 --> 00:41:10,755
having those conversations and
being open about where you are

647
00:41:10,755 --> 00:41:15,195
too, if you're on the other side
of that, that pairing screen is

648
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:19,936
essential. Do you have any tips
for people who are on that side

649
00:41:19,965 --> 00:41:23,445
of the screen? So opposite of you
David, about like how, how do you

650
00:41:23,445 --> 00:41:27,496
ask those questions or what can
help make this a successful

651
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:31,005
session by having these, this
conversation?

652
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:35,240
David: Well, I like everything
you just said. Bekah all of that

653
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,900
is really important. Asking
questions. The faster you ask a

654
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,900
question, the faster you'll find
out if the person that you're

655
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:47,251
pairing. Is, you know, how
they're gonna react to you and

656
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:49,471
the faster you'll find out if
that's gonna work for you and

657
00:41:49,471 --> 00:41:52,380
it's gonna be a pairing session
that you wanna stick with, or if

658
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,541
the person's not gonna treat you
well, not in a place where they

659
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:57,360
have the skills to treat you
well, and, and you can get out of

660
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,840
there, right? The faster, it's
all about feedback and shortening

661
00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:03,840
feedback loops. So that's one
part of it is the faster, you can

662
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,780
ask questions, the faster you can
say, what, you know, the faster

663
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,751
you can say, what you don't know
without, you know, with as little

664
00:42:09,751 --> 00:42:13,485
emotion or. Um, I mean, we're all
emotional people. I don't mean to

665
00:42:13,485 --> 00:42:17,175
say you have to be abstract, but
there's that thing that we do

666
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:22,215
sometimes I've done it when I was
learning Indonesia. I. When I was

667
00:42:22,215 --> 00:42:26,476
almost embarrassed to share what
I knew embarrassed to try to

668
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:29,775
speak in a new language. And I
think it's very similar with

669
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:32,326
technology. If you're not
familiar with language or

670
00:42:32,326 --> 00:42:37,456
concepts, it can feel
embarrassing to try, but please

671
00:42:37,456 --> 00:42:41,235
do the faster you try. And the,
the faster you take risks, the

672
00:42:41,235 --> 00:42:44,085
faster you'll find out who will
support you in those risks and,

673
00:42:44,235 --> 00:42:46,096
and how fast you can grow.

674
00:42:46,936 --> 00:42:50,146
Dan: Yeah. And I just wanted to
add that that advice applies not

675
00:42:50,146 --> 00:42:53,235
just to beginners too. It's it
can be embarrassing for me. I

676
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:55,576
mean, I can feel that
embarrassment, you know, trying

677
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:59,626
new things and, and, and, um,
some hesitancy and things like

678
00:42:59,626 --> 00:43:02,865
that. So it's great advice I just
did and it applies to everybody

679
00:43:02,865 --> 00:43:04,755
and we all go through it. You
know what I mean? So,

680
00:43:05,146 --> 00:43:07,306
David: And we go, that's
important that you bring up Dan,

681
00:43:07,306 --> 00:43:09,945
cuz we go through it. Not just
once. It's not just something you

682
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:14,460
go through. As you're entering
your technology career, and

683
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,880
that's why it's so important to
get practiced at it because you

684
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,780
will experience that throughout
your career. Cuz we're always

685
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,840
learning and technologies are
always frame, uh, changing new

686
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,311
frameworks, new libraries. You
mentioned earlier, a Java script

687
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:34,380
or a Java developer who was
learning Ruby, I think. And um,

688
00:43:35,085 --> 00:43:38,175
When I first started learning go
I've program C sharp for years

689
00:43:38,175 --> 00:43:40,755
when I first started learning, go
bang. My head against things felt

690
00:43:40,755 --> 00:43:45,976
awkward. Didn't know how to ask
questions. Um, I have been known

691
00:43:45,976 --> 00:43:51,376
to rant about type script and
Webpack in Virtual Coffee

692
00:43:51,376 --> 00:43:57,916
threads. And, uh, I kind of laugh
as I do that because that's me

693
00:43:57,916 --> 00:44:02,925
where I could. I could write C
sharp, cold, probably in, from

694
00:44:02,925 --> 00:44:05,835
memory from just having, like, I
know the syntax so well, cuz I've

695
00:44:05,835 --> 00:44:08,266
done it so long and I can't for
the life of me, figure out

696
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:09,766
Webpack or.

697
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:10,740
Dan: Nobody

698
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:13,351
David: And I struggle with type
script bindings, and I was

699
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:16,231
working with JavaScript back
before it was popular. So

700
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:20,331
Dan: what? Pec David it's okay.

701
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:25,081
David: it's good to have
community in that. Uh, but yeah,

702
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:28,380
every, every time you go to every
time I've gone to a new project

703
00:44:28,411 --> 00:44:31,351
or gone to a new company or
changed jobs, there's that

704
00:44:31,351 --> 00:44:33,990
learning curve. Again, every time
I pair with somebody new there's

705
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:39,766
that learning curve. I was just
banging my head this past weekend

706
00:44:39,766 --> 00:44:43,635
against one of the old advent of
code problems and feeling like I

707
00:44:43,635 --> 00:44:45,795
don't know what I'm doing, you
know, and I've been doing this a

708
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,826
long time. So getting comfortable
with that feeling is really

709
00:44:48,826 --> 00:44:49,335
valuable.

710
00:44:49,695 --> 00:44:49,905
Dan: Yeah.

711
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:52,036
David: It's good. Good work to
practice.

712
00:44:53,385 --> 00:44:55,726
Dan: Agreed. Yeah. I'm, I'm
digging into type script for

713
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:58,485
really the first time over the
last month or two too. So we have

714
00:44:58,815 --> 00:45:02,056
type script. Tuesdays is my
little plug. Uh for Tuesday, 2:00

715
00:45:02,056 --> 00:45:05,925
PM, uh, Eastern, uh, with Kirk,
um, who is, who's like a, you

716
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:09,525
know, he's, he's done a lot of,
he is a fan of, you know,

717
00:45:09,525 --> 00:45:13,981
strongly type things. And I have
been, uh, Long time, not fan of

718
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:17,940
that. So but some of it, some of
it is avoiding it is, is, you

719
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:20,190
know, you open, I open up, I've
been writing JavaScript for 20

720
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,831
years and I open up a type script
file and I'm like, this looks.

721
00:45:23,701 --> 00:45:26,701
Nonsense to me. I can't
understand it and I close it, but

722
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:30,721
I, and I, and I like I'm instead
of like digging in or asking

723
00:45:30,721 --> 00:45:33,360
questions and making myself, you
know, possibly look like, I don't

724
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,351
know, everything, I close it and
run away and say, are dumb. It's

725
00:45:37,356 --> 00:45:41,010
dumb. you know, that's what I've
done for the last 10 years or

726
00:45:41,016 --> 00:45:44,010
whatever. And so finally I was
like, okay, let's, let's, let's

727
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,271
dig in. And so, um,

728
00:45:45,496 --> 00:45:48,735
David: Okay. And full on every
time I've ranted about wet bag or

729
00:45:48,735 --> 00:45:52,126
type script, I'm aware that it's
because I haven't spent the time

730
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:58,545
to learn it. sometimes it's fun
to put on that grumpy old M hat

731
00:45:58,545 --> 00:46:01,065
and say, yeah, I've been
programming JavaScript since,

732
00:46:01,065 --> 00:46:04,246
before there were types I don't
who needs types, like write your

733
00:46:04,246 --> 00:46:11,106
angle, brackets. I, whatever. No
it's, but none of that undo, like

734
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,686
I really there's an element of
humility. That's important to

735
00:46:13,686 --> 00:46:17,016
practice in this industry because
there's so much lack of humility,

736
00:46:17,315 --> 00:46:20,945
abounds, um, arrogance, abounds,
gate, keeping abounds and

737
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:24,065
anything we can do to be humble
with each other and really

738
00:46:24,065 --> 00:46:28,445
support each other to work
together and to grow together is,

739
00:46:28,445 --> 00:46:30,396
uh, a net positive.

740
00:46:30,646 --> 00:46:34,306
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. And, and I think
a lot of that, um, arrogance and

741
00:46:34,786 --> 00:46:38,985
gate keeping and some is, is
because the root cause of it is

742
00:46:38,985 --> 00:46:42,425
insecurity. Right. And, and not
wanting to, not wanting to look.

743
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,440
Or look like you don't know
things and have I've fallen in

744
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,621
that drive. I try, like, I don't,
I don't know. Maybe I, I haven't,

745
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,170
haven't noticed, but I, I don't
usually for me it doesn't, uh,

746
00:46:52,231 --> 00:46:55,021
manifest as gate keeping
hopefully, uh, or things like

747
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:57,931
that. It just manifests me
avoiding topics. I don't wanna, I

748
00:46:57,931 --> 00:47:00,300
don't wanna, you know, learn or
don't know or whatever, you know,

749
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:06,811
um, and that practicing humility
and practicing, um, admitting or,

750
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:10,666
or, you know, being public about
not knowing things, um, It's been

751
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:12,556
something I've been personally
working on for the last couple

752
00:47:12,556 --> 00:47:15,585
years and, and it's, and it feels
good once you, once you turn the

753
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:18,135
corner, once you realize it,
doesn't actually like, you know,

754
00:47:18,195 --> 00:47:22,005
hurt, uh, to not know literally
everything in the world.

755
00:47:22,365 --> 00:47:25,306
Bekah: What I will say too. One
of the greatest learning. Answers

756
00:47:25,306 --> 00:47:29,806
I've had over the past couple
years is watching conversations

757
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:34,096
in slack, between people who I
see as experts in the field

758
00:47:34,246 --> 00:47:37,335
asking each other questions,
right. Like, oh, okay. This is

759
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,766
how you ask that question. Or,
you know, they don't know

760
00:47:39,766 --> 00:47:43,876
everything. And that does help
provide more of an awareness that

761
00:47:43,965 --> 00:47:45,615
I can ask those questions too.

762
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,561
David: that reminds me. I wanna
go back to that. A part of the

763
00:47:49,561 --> 00:47:51,900
question that you asked Bekah
that we didn't really address,

764
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:58,260
which is what makes a good
question. And, uh, if you think

765
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:03,360
about everything we've been
talking about the faster you can

766
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:10,050
help somebody. Acclimatize to how
to speak to you the faster you'll

767
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:13,141
get your question answered. And
so how do you do that? You learn

768
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:16,860
to add more detail in the
question, which is like your

769
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,010
initial offering to somebody.
When you're asking somebody for

770
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,911
help, the more you can put into
that question to say, I thought

771
00:48:23,911 --> 00:48:28,681
about this. I tried this, um,
here's the command I used. Here's

772
00:48:28,681 --> 00:48:33,181
the output that I got, like the
more language. That you use

773
00:48:33,181 --> 00:48:35,550
often, it's a better question
because you're giving somebody

774
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:39,121
more context and the ability to
understand better where you're at

775
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:43,561
and what you're really dealing
with. I, I get questions in my

776
00:48:43,561 --> 00:48:46,501
job. Sometimes I get questions
like the integration environment

777
00:48:46,505 --> 00:48:52,447
is down and I look at that and I
say, okay, thank you. The

778
00:48:52,447 --> 00:48:59,257
integration environ. Um, where I
work has probably like 75

779
00:48:59,257 --> 00:49:02,976
microservices or more across like
grouped into several different

780
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:06,007
applications. And so integration
is down could mean any number of

781
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:10,686
things. Are, is that a, is, are
you getting an, an authentication

782
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:14,347
error? Is that a, you know, do
you have an HTP status code you

783
00:49:14,347 --> 00:49:17,496
can share? Do you have, can you
tell me what application was

784
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:20,586
trying to call? What application
can you tell me? What was the

785
00:49:20,586 --> 00:49:24,092
actual response you got? What.
Compared to the expected response

786
00:49:24,092 --> 00:49:26,581
you got. Can you tell me what
language you're working in? Can

787
00:49:26,581 --> 00:49:29,222
you tell me what version of the
language you're working in? Can

788
00:49:29,222 --> 00:49:31,831
you tell me what libraries and
tools you're using that might be

789
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:35,431
relevant? You know, all of that
detail is helpful, partly cuz it

790
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:39,092
teaches the people who might
answer your question, what

791
00:49:39,097 --> 00:49:41,942
language they can use with you
because you're exposing what

792
00:49:41,942 --> 00:49:46,882
language, you know, and it's also
giving people more. Detail to

793
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:49,851
hang onto. There are problems
that I can solve. And I have done

794
00:49:49,851 --> 00:49:52,911
in our Virtual Coffee slack,
where just seeing the error

795
00:49:52,911 --> 00:49:55,311
message reminds me of something
I've already seen. And I can

796
00:49:55,311 --> 00:49:58,041
point somebody without even
needing to be at a computer or

797
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:01,461
look at their screen. I can at
least offer a few keywords or

798
00:50:01,461 --> 00:50:04,132
say, go try this or go try that.
You know? And sometimes that's

799
00:50:04,132 --> 00:50:07,702
enough to unblock somebody, but
if, if the person who asked the

800
00:50:07,702 --> 00:50:12,981
question didn't include the
actual error message, then. I've

801
00:50:12,987 --> 00:50:17,541
seen also where that can turn
into a thread of 55 messages long

802
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:21,532
with people talking past each
other. So as somebody who wants

803
00:50:21,536 --> 00:50:25,461
to ask a question, I don't expect
you to have solved the problem.

804
00:50:25,641 --> 00:50:28,461
It's not this idea that, you
know, don't come to me with

805
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:30,742
problems only come to me with
solutions. Like it's not that

806
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:36,202
business, not at all, but it's
share with me what you've already

807
00:50:36,202 --> 00:50:41,407
thought about. and share with me
as much detail as you can, about

808
00:50:41,407 --> 00:50:44,226
what you know, and what you don't
know about the problem that

809
00:50:44,226 --> 00:50:49,777
you're asking. Cause that will
help me learn where you're

810
00:50:49,777 --> 00:50:52,146
struggling and how to speak to
you about it.

811
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,597
Bekah: Yeah. Thank you so much
for being here with us today,

812
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:58,626
David, this was just fantastic. I
feel like we could have done

813
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:01,927
three hours worth of this
conversation, but I do appreciate

814
00:51:01,927 --> 00:51:05,586
your time and, uh, thanks for
helping us to kick off our new

815
00:51:05,586 --> 00:51:05,786
season.

816
00:51:06,501 --> 00:51:07,461
David: Oh, my pleasure.

817
00:51:08,092 --> 00:51:13,494
