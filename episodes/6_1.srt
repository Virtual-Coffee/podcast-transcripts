00:00:06,535 --> 00:00:10,555
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 6, Episode 1

2
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:13,105
of the Virtual Coffee podcast.
I'm Bekah --

3
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,315
Dan Ott: Woohoo. [Dan and Bekah
chuckle] We're back!

4
00:00:18,356 --> 00:00:22,495
Bekah: We are back. We are
back featuring members of the

5
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:26,175
Virtual Coffee community. A
community that is an intimate

6
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:29,635
group of developers at all stages
of their coding journey. And

7
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:32,045
they're here, on this podcast,
sharing their stories and what

8
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:36,000
they've learned. And we're here
to share it with you. Obviously,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,240
here with me today [chuckles]
is my co-host, Dan.

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,256
Dan: Wuddup, Bek. How's it
going?

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,210
Bekah: Do you do that every
Season 1 intro?

12
00:00:46,856 --> 00:00:50,000
Dan: I ... hope so. Probably
not. But now I will.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Bekah: Yeah.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,930
Dan: From here on out. Yes.

13
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,000
Bekah: Will you remember that,
in Season 7?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Dan: No.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,960
Bekah: Hmm. Okay.

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,670
Dan: But, it probably won't be
the only time I say 'Wuddup, Bek,'

15
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:01,926
[Bekah chuckles] either, so,
you know? How's it going?

16
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:06,251
Bekah: It's going great!
Because we're launching the new

17
00:01:06,251 --> 00:01:07,240
season of the podcast.

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,000
Dan: Woohoo! [Dan and Bekah
chuckle] Yes, we are. It was

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,921
-- Season 5 was pretty awesome.

19
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,215
And Season 6 is also gonna be
awesome [chuckles].

20
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:24,221
Bekah: It is true. It is always
awesome. We are consistent in one

21
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:28,240
thing, and one thing only. and
it is having awesome people on

22
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:28,786
our podcast.

23
00:01:29,305 --> 00:01:35,141
Dan: Yes. Agreed. So, yeah. So
we are starting Season 6 off

24
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:42,521
with ... an awesome guest [laughs],
of the name, David Alpert. David is

25
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:47,021
a director -- no, wait. What
is he? I lost it. David is the

26
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:51,971
Director of Engineering, sorry,
at Northfield IT. And one of

27
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:56,740
the many Canadians we have in
Virtual Coffee, and also on the

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,021
podcast [chuckles]. Not the first,
won't be the last. And yeah, we had

29
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,686
a really great time talking to
David.

30
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:06,835
Bekah: Yeah. David is one of
those conversations that could

31
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:11,126
have continued on, for sure,
beyond the hour. He has so much

32
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:16,165
insight into â€” not just like the
technology field, but in working

33
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:21,116
with other people. And he --
I really appreciated his

34
00:02:21,116 --> 00:02:25,855
thoughtfulness in how he
approaches other people, and

35
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:26,575
supporting them.

36
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:29,485
Dan: Yeah. Absolutely. That, I mean,
like, that- that's gotta be one of

37
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:32,980
the first things I think of when I-
when I think of David is- is, yeah.

38
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,020
Thoughtfulness, and- and ... I
don't know. I, you know, like

39
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,401
thoughtful and- and empathetic is- is
-- what the -- he's one of the, I mean,

40
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:48,820
he's- he's always on Slack, and he's
... I- [chuckles] I dunno. Like,

41
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,640
everybody loves him. He's always
so great to talk to. Anytime you --

42
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,711
anytime you're kinda working
through something or have some

43
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,000
existential crisis [chuckles]-

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Bekah: Yeah.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Dan: -I feel like David's one
of those- one of those people

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,841
that will show up and ... you
know, act- like, actually

45
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:04,211
have constructive ways to maybe
work through some- some hard

46
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:06,312
problems and stuff. It's- it's
really- it's really nice having

47
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:06,973
him around.

48
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:11,950
Bekah: Yeah. And- and the -- that
empathy that he brings to the

49
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:19,181
situation is really ...
authentic and true, you know?

50
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:22,121
Somebody might check in and see
how you're doing, but, you know,

51
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:25,781
if you get a message from David,
he means that. And I think that

52
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:29,381
goes a long way to supporting
people, and helping them feel

53
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:34,300
comfortable, and allowing them to,
you know, grow and- and learn in

54
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,651
those ways, and support them.

55
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:44,027
Dan: Absolutely. Okay. What
is our random question? How do

56
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:45,000
we start the episode
[chuckles]? Bekah, how are we

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,907
gonna start this episode
[chuckles]?

57
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:49,473
Bekah: [Chuckles] Well ...
well --

58
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:51,203
Dan: [Laughs] I don't know.

59
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:58,447
Bekah: Why don't- why don't we
in the first episode intro talk

60
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,796
about the other guests too?

61
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:05,000
Dan: Oh, totally. Yeah. [Bekah
and Dan chuckle] I don't

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,257
know. I haven't done this for
a while.

62
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:10,209
Bekah: We're excited about this
episode, and the rest of the

63
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:16,418
season. So, we're also going to
be talking to ... Bogdan about

64
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,959
navigating tech career paths. We
have quite a bit of career path

65
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,649
episodes this season. So, we're
gonna be learning about what it

66
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:28,872
means to be a demo engineer, a
developer educator, we're gonna

67
00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:32,653
be talking through interviews, and
open source contributions. So, I

68
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:40,002
think this is a pretty well rounded
season to ... I don't know ...

69
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:42,000
get you excited about all things.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Dan: Yeah. I'm excited about
all things.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,973
Bekah: Am I spinning chair? I've
got a spinny chair this season.

71
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,838
Dan: You have -- yes. Bekah got
a spinny chair and she has not

72
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:50,127
stopped spinning since she
got it [chuckles].

73
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:52,632
Bekah: It is the best thing.
I just continue to spin.

74
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:56,788
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. It's- it's --
well, it is what it is. I feel

75
00:04:56,788 --> 00:05:00,387
like you're doing a good job of,
like, rotating around your

76
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:03,057
microphone and staying in a good
speaking position though. Though --

77
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,887
Bekah: Yeah. I'm trying to keep my
head straight on the microphone. See-

78
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:05,908
Dan: So, well done. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

79
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:09,747
Bekah: -my body turns, but my
head ... do- does minimal turning.

80
00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:12,958
Dan: Yeah. No. It's -- you-
you're doing a good job.

81
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:19,192
Bekah: Thanks. That's all I
needed to hear today. But we are

82
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:23,182
going to start this episode of
the podcast like we start every

83
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:27,141
episode of the podcast and every
Virtual Coffee. Say our name,

84
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:30,831
where we're from, what we do,
and answer a random check-in

85
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,281
question. So we hope you enjoyed
this episode and the rest of

86
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:45,045
Season 6. Today's random check-in
question is, if you could

87
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:50,055
magically become fluent in any
language, what would it be? My

88
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:55,005
name is Bekah. I am a technical
community builder from a small

89
00:05:55,011 --> 00:06:04,516
town in Ohio, and ... I think I would
go with Polish, only because I'm

90
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:10,170
mostly Polish and I would like to
know more of it. It's definitely not

91
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,831
the most practical, but it's
probably the most meaningful.

92
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,709
Dan: All right, Polish.

93
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:18,949
Bekah: Yes. See, that was the
most straightforward-

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Dan: [Laughs] Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I
know, I know [chuckles]. I don't --

94
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:19,750
Bekah: -I've ever been in an
intro.

95
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,910
Dan: Yeah. Okay. Hi, I'm Dan.
I do web development things

96
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:32,420
in Cleveland. And, yeah. I
don't know. Languages are hard.

97
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,870
I -- this is an attractive
question to me because I- I'm bad

98
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,300
at like learning languages. I
took like three years of German,

99
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,000
and, like, I struggled with
Spanish in college, and I

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,139
don't -- I took three

100
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,410
years of German. I don't know. I
can still count to 10, I think. But,

101
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,600
you know, Spanish would be -- I
think- I think I'm gonna choose

102
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,100
Spanish. I, you know, it just,
it -- I- I like going to

103
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,000
Mexican restaurants [chuckles].
I like, you know, and there-

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,310
there's a lot of Spanish

104
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,269
speaking people, you know, in
America, and, although

105
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:03,079
Japanese would be cool too. I- I
love, like, listening to Japanese,

106
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,769
you know? People speaking
Japanese. I like -- I just like the

107
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:09,709
way it sounds. So, that'd be cool
too. And- and it's so different

108
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,319
than English that, you know,
that's one -- that's really hard

109
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:15,920
for me to wrap my head around ever ...
being able to speak [chuckles]. So

110
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,470
I'm- I'm kind of tied 50-50,
Spanish and Japanese. That's

111
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,069
gonna be my answer.

112
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:24,675
David Alpert: Well, since Dan said
to you, I'm gonna say to you. My

113
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:29,415
name is David Alpert. And I'm-
I'm a software developer and

114
00:07:29,444 --> 00:07:36,019
DevOps engineer in Winnipeg,
Manitoba. And I was having a hard

115
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:39,000
time picking just one. So since
Dan set the example-

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Dan: Yeah.

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
David: -my first thought was
Indonesian. Because I spent

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,189
some time in Indonesia and

117
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:47,779
I remember just enough Indonesian
to say some things to Ayu, for

118
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:51,560
example, in our community. But I'm
no -- by no means, fluent. And it

119
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,910
would just be so much fun to
be fluent a-again, or more, in

120
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,064
Indonesian. But then, Bekah,
when you mentioned Polish, I- I

121
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:03,185
thought Hebrew because that would
connect me with some of my family

122
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:06,904
and some of my tradition, so -- that
I've drifted a little bit from. So,

123
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:09,125
Hebrew and Indonesian.

124
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:10,415
Dan: I like it.

125
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:10,774
David: I will go there.

126
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,709
Bekah: Yeah. Thanks, David.
Normally, I- I ask our guests to

127
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:18,529
choose one thing, and then I choose
four or five. So [chuckles] --

128
00:08:19,894 --> 00:08:21,175
David: So we turned the tables
today.

129
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:25,339
Bekah: Yeah. Welcome to the
podcast. Thanks so much for being

130
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:29,779
here with us today. We always
like to start with the origin

131
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:33,649
story of our guests. So tell us
a little bit about your origin

132
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,840
story and how that brought you
to where you are today.

133
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,770
David: Well, I was thinking about
this question. I love that you start

134
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,780
with the origin story, and the
way you frame it as origin. I can

135
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,030
remember using the Logo computer
language to make the little

136
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,030
turtle-

137
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,000
Dan: Yes. yes.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
David: -draw back and forth.
I don't remember a lot about

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,181
it, but I remember being really
excited when I discovered loops.

138
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:04,431
And I didn't even know they were
called loops, but I could draw

139
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:09,816
flowers with not very much ...
code. So that was pretty

140
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:15,365
exciting. And then I went to, you
know, high school, and grew up, and

141
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:19,775
lots of things happened. I
went to university and took a

142
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:22,775
computer science degree. I wound
up taking a computer science

143
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:26,736
degree. And that taught me a lot
of fundamentals about

144
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:30,905
computer architecture, saying
like hardware architecture.

145
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:33,456
There was a computer engineering
course in there too. And also

146
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:38,166
basics of data structures and
algorithms. So I feel like, I got

147
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:43,385
a leg up on that before there was
any of the ... now all the code

148
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,755
camps and everything, the
freeCodeCamps, and the Flatiron

149
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:48,485
School, and everything that I hear
about, all the resources that are

150
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:53,556
available today. I didn't have those
back -- at that time, so -- but

151
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:56,615
I was fortunate enough to be able
to go to this university program.

152
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,765
And I studied not only computer
science, but also it was kind of

153
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,426
a liberal artsy program. And I
got exposed to all sorts of other

154
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,591
things that were not technical
in the world. And I got very

155
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:08,961
distracted, and I didn't want
anything to do with technology,

156
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:12,620
and I wanted to go find something
more meaningful to do. So I went

157
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,990
and I traveled. And that's when
I wound up in Indonesia with an

158
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,711
exchange program, with ...
Canadian Crossroads

159
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:22,341
International â€” a cultural
exchange program, designed to

160
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:28,640
expose people to different cultures.
And ... as I was proceeding

161
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,086
with my life, I noticed a common thread
that ... I would constantly notice

162
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:38,196
that people around me that I cared
about â€” friends, family â€” would

163
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:43,145
be stressed or unhappy with
technology. And they would be

164
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:46,355
frustrated, and they would start
to internalize it. Like, "Oh, I'm

165
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:49,326
not good at this." Or, "I must
not be very smart because I can't

166
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:53,105
figure this out." And I would
look at what they were struggling

167
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:58,086
with, and I was frustrated. I got
frustrated because it wa- I knew

168
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:02,691
enough about technology to know that
it didn't have to be that way. And

169
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:06,980
that what my friends and family
were struggling with was ... design

170
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,770
decisions that somebody had made
that hadn't really thought about

171
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,370
how they would land on a real
person. And that's really what

172
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,961
prompted me to get back into
technology. And from there,

173
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:21,051
I've done a number of technology
jobs -- technology related jobs,

174
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:25,941
web, front end â€” now we would
call it front-end development. At

175
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:29,750
the time I was starting to learn
about front-end engineering, and

176
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,041
that was back when ... I remember
before Firebug was introduced,

177
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,591
like back before Chrome dev
tools. And then Firebug was a

178
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:40,100
really big deal. jQuery and
Firebug changed the way we did

179
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:42,110
web development, back then.

180
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:42,910
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, it did.

181
00:11:43,341 --> 00:11:48,650
David: And now -- well, from-
from there, I got tired of front

182
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,571
end, then I got interested in
backend. So I went and did

183
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:53,211
backend. I did a lot of C#.
I did years and years of C#.

184
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:57,426
In fact, I found, recently, a
commit somewhere in GitHub from

185
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,785
16 years ago that I did in C#.
I've been writing code

186
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:01,446
for a long time.

188
00:12:03,426 --> 00:12:06,846
David: And from there, I went to
various software developer jobs

189
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:10,655
and took some project management
training, got involved in the

190
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:17,436
local Winnipeg agile community,
and found my way into builds and

191
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:22,296
deploys. And that's what got me
into DevOps. And now, here I am.

192
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,000
Dan: That's awesome.

192
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,071
Bekah: That's -- I was gonna say
great, but --

193
00:12:28,191 --> 00:12:29,000
Dan: That- that -- oh, it's
great. It is great, also. It's

194
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,120
great and awesome.

194
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,000
No, that- that's a cool ...
that's -- I- I love having

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,230
people on ... I mean, I

195
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,000
love having [chuckles] all of
our guest. It's- it's always

196
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,051
fun for- for me having

196
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,961
people on, who started like
when you started, when I, you

197
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:44,480
know, back a long time ago. I- I --
Logo, I hadn't thought about for a

198
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:47,061
long time. I- I definitely did
Logo in, like, the computer lab in-

199
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:51,681
in middle school. What I was
-- I had a question for you.

200
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:54,350
What was it? Oh, it was ...
okay. So you mentioned like,

201
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,441
red- like, learning fundamentals
and learning computer science

202
00:12:57,441 --> 00:13:01,250
stuff, sort of maybe a ... I don't
know what the -- hard computer

203
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,880
science [chuckles] ... I dunno what
a good term is for it. But, you know,

204
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,181
this -- the kind of stuff that, at
least back in the day you learned

205
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:12,110
in computer science courses in
college, right, versus

206
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:16,025
today, where there's so many
different, like, places to go.

207
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:19,025
So many different ways to learn,
so many different approaches to

208
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:22,446
learning, even. And I guess
the thought that I had was,

209
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:26,225
what do you think, like, can you
imagine trying to learn from

210
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,250
scratch now, and would you want
to? If you were starting over

211
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,071
right now [chuckles], right? But you
have all the stuff available. Would

212
00:13:34,071 --> 00:13:38,000
you rather go that fundamentals
level and learning stuff, probably

213
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:41,331
in languages that you're never
going to use in, you know, in- in

214
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:44,301
practical levels, but you're
getting all the fundamental stuff?

215
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,000
Or would you, like, there's
bootstrap- bootstrap -- no.

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,400
Boot-camps [chuckles]. Sorry.

216
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,931
Bootcamps, a-a-and everything
like that, that will put you

217
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:56,870
more in a practical place to-
to get, you know, where- where

218
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,030
you're learning some JavaScripts,
and learning React, and stuff like

219
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,770
that, even before you ... know ...
maybe some of the more esoteric

220
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,010
pieces of computer science, you
know? And so, this is not a judge-

221
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,291
like, I'm not asking you to like,
place judgment on anything, but

222
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,451
just like from a personal- personal
standpoint. Like, where- where-

223
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,211
where do you -- like, where would
you land? Like, where would you

224
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,230
personally rather ... start, if you
could start- [chuckles] if you could

225
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,370
start from scratch, you know,
now?

226
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:21,995
David: This is a really good
question, Dan. And it's come

227
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,426
up a number of times in Virtual
Coffee, because we have a number

228
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:28,355
of people who are career changers
or- or early career people in

229
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:31,326
the- in the community. And they're
constantly wondering, "What

230
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:32,000
do I do next?" and "What do
I look?"

231
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

231
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
David: The way you phrased it
though, for me, if I were to

232
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,556
start now ... I- I -- one of
the things I

232
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:45,995
notice about the technical
landscape today, compared to when

233
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:50,916
I started, is it seems to have
exploded in technologies, and

234
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:55,505
frameworks, and libraries, and
possibilities. And I think it

235
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,000
would -- I would lean towards
practical first.

236
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

236
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
David: Because I think that
would help me learn enough

237
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,801
about one thing to start to
work.

237
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:11,211
And really, once you get into --
once you cross that difficult

238
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:14,331
barrier of finding your first
job in technology, then you can

239
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,000
get paid to learn-

240
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000 
Dan: Absolutely. Yeah.

241
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,780
David: -as you work. And- and
then you can ... I don't know,

240
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:26,105
maybe ... I think it would be
worthwhile to take some survey

241
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:30,035
course of the fundamentals, some
high level survey course so that

242
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:34,296
you introduce the -- or you- you're
introduced to the words and

243
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:38,706
phrases, because I find that the
computer science degree helps me

244
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:42,066
in two ways. One, that having
those fundamentals often helps

245
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,605
me understand new frameworks.
Cuz I kinda understand how

246
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:50,375
computers work underneath, and all
of the languages and frameworks.

247
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,255
So learning any particular
practical framework gets, I think,

248
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:55,115
easier with that fundamental
background.

249
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:56,436
Dan: Yeah.

250
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:59,735
David: But I don't think it's required
to learn how to work in any of those

251
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:02,885
things. I just think that it
helps me. The other place I

252
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:06,186
notice is that it helps me in
searching for things when I go

253
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:10,686
to Google, sometimes. The terms
and the phrases, I think. I'm

254
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:14,586
drawing from that training back
then. So, that's where I think

255
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:17,885
maybe a survey course ... without
having to go deep in all those

256
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:20,796
things, because you -- I only
remember the things that I use. And-

257
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:21,365
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

258
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:22,000
David: -we joke -- I mean, we work
in- in DevOps where caching is a

258
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:30,426
thing. You know, one of the- the
two hard problems in computer

259
00:16:30,426 --> 00:16:35,975
science [Bekah and Dan chuckle], right?
And we joke about, 'My memory only holds

260
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:39,966
so much,' and, 'I expire things
for my mental cache when I go and-

261
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:40,000
Dan: [Chuckles] Yeah, absolutely.

261
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:43,355
David: -learn something new.' You
know, you ask me a question about

262
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:45,905
something that I supposedly
studied, and, 'I have a cache miss,

263
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,000
and I have to go look it up.'
[Dan laughs] But I do find

264
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,355
that things that I have

264
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:52,000
learned and then purged, often
come back easier-

265
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Dan: Yeah.

266
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Bekah: Mm.

265
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
David: -or more easily. So-

266
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Dan: Yeah.

267
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
David: -that's a long winded
way of to say-

268
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Dan: Yeah!

266
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
David: -I would start practical,
today, because there's so many

267
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,326
... widespread things. I think
it

267
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:04,476
would take a long time to go
from fundamentals to something

268
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,000
practical, today. But-

269
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

270
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,931
David: -I think if
you start today with something 

269
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:12,096
practical, you could add- but, maybe,
just a quick survey of -- you don't

270
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:14,855
need to kn- understand all the data
structures and algorithms. But

271
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:19,925
like, if you can name three of
them, cuz you know they exist,

272
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:22,536
then you can search up
implementations of them or

273
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:23,945
details about them, when you
need them.

274
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:24,681
Dan: Yeah.

275
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:25,191
Bekah: Good idea.

276
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,010
Dan: Oh, I think that -- I love
that answer. I, you know, and I

277
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:30,830
think I tend to agree with you. I
per- I mean, also personally, I-

278
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:36,050
I ... got interested in computer
development stuff because of the

279
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,770
-- like Logo, you know, seeing
something happen right away, you

280
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,000
know [chuckles]? Like, hitting
save, and then like looking at

281
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,050
it, and, you

281
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,921
know, whatever. And so-sometimes
-- or- or writing code on a

282
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:50,030
chalkboard and stuff like that is
like ... was -- I drifted away from

283
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,411
it in college because ... I
was computer science major to

284
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:57,441
start as well. And, you know, it- it
just got less and less- [chuckles] less

285
00:17:57,441 --> 00:18:00,711
and less like, fun, you know? I
dunno. But you're right. Like the --

286
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:07,010
knowing the ... like, for instance,
the Big-O notation, right?

287
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,851
Like, analyzing ho-how a -- ho-how long
a function takes to do a thing, you

288
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:13,760
know? I don't think anybody
that's writing React code for

289
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,340
their job needs to know the names
of all the different, you know?

290
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,000
Or even ... [chuckles] like,
they don't need to know the --

291
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,651
even the phrase 'Big-O',

291
00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:25,671
right? But knowing that will help
you- will help you sort of think

292
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:29,691
through and go -- like- like,
having that in your brain would ...

293
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,681
in the background, and it's okay if
it's expired cache [chuckles], but

294
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:35,990
you'll still like, see something
and start like -- it's like code

295
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
smell, kind of, you know?

296
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
David: I know.

297
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,961
Dan: That -- it's just like a
weird phrase, but

296
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:40,760
like, a phrase that makes a lot
of sense to people who have been

297
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,401
doing it for a while i-is- is
you'll start to get like these

298
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,000
instincts or whatever these-
these -- like, i-it's okay if

299
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,881
you don't know the

299
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:49,671
exact phrase or I don't remember
the exact name of it -- some specific

300
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:54,020
[chuckles] algorithm or anything like
that, but ... okay, I know just sort of

301
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,871
almost intuitively that this
thing is going to take like way

302
00:18:56,871 --> 00:19:00,530
longer ... than it should. And I
probably can do it a different-

303
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,000
different way, you know? That-
that sort of thing.

304
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
David: Right.

304
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,211
Dan: I think that's the sort of thing
that would hit on your idea of the --

305
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:08,961
like doing- doing a high
level, you know, survey

306
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:10,881
course, something like that.
You'll get exposed to some of

307
00:19:10,885 --> 00:19:14,151
that stuff, even if ... and you
don't need to know, like, the down

308
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:15,080
and dirty details, you know?

309
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:20,645
David: Even if we take something
that is, like, computer sciencey

310
00:19:20,796 --> 00:19:27,000
heavy, like Big-O notation, it's
very, almost ... theoretical or a-

311
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,980
Dan: Right.

311
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,980
David: -an academic. Like, it's a
very academic way to approach this-

312
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,310
Dan: Exactly.

312
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,570
David: -technology thing. Not a very
practical way. But, knowing that --

313
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,530
like, being able to -- like, knowing
that something called Big-O

314
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,760
notation exists, being able to
have one sentence about it, will

315
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:49,701
help you identify when it might
be ... in, like, a part of the

316
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:52,941
problem you're dealing with, and
give you enough words to go and

317
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,851
Google the details of how it
intersects with the problem

318
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:59,691
you're with. And you don't need
to be able to explain it in

319
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:00,711
detail or --

320
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:01,836
Dan: Right.

321
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:02,000
David: Do you see what I mean? So-

322
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Dan: Totally.

323
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,401
David: -just knowing that it's
a thing or

322
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:07,461
knowing that caching is a thing
without knowing how caching works

323
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:13,941
or, knowing that ... I don't know. The-
the one that came to mind as you were

324
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:18,830
talking is that string concatenation is
expensive in C# [Bekah and Dan chuckle],

325
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,750
for whatever reason. Because strings
are immutable in C#. They're

326
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,540
treated as immutable objects. So
every time you're joining strings

327
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,230
together, you're allocating extra
memory and copying everything

328
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:35,030
over. So it's a very expensive
operation. That detail of C#

329
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,641
would never have stuck for me if I
don't think -- if I didn't know a

330
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:40,101
little bit of fundamentals about
how memory allocation works.

331
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,871
Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

332
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:47,395
Bekah: I think too, once you are
working, you- you're coding more

333
00:20:47,395 --> 00:20:51,236
rather than you're learning. Those
concepts become easier to

334
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:54,955
understand, because we- if you're
learning, they- they are kind of

335
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:59,185
theoretical, right? Because you
have no use to apply them. Or if

336
00:20:59,185 --> 00:21:02,486
you are building a project for a
bootcamp or something, it's a

337
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:07,891
tiny little project. So it
doesn't exactly correlate m-much-

338
00:21:07,951 --> 00:21:11,520
much of that stuff with what
you're doing. So when you have

339
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,611
that like practical application
and you're learning that, like,

340
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:19,740
"Oh, okay. I understand where this
would be applied or where I would

341
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:23,941
need to reference this idea." And,
at least for me, it becomes a

342
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:28,800
little bit easier once I can see ...
all right. Th-this is where we

343
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,911
need to think about this.

344
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:34,431
David: This- this goes to my
understanding of how we learn as

345
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:38,000
humans. Like, we learn better when
there's emotion involved, we

346
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,361
learn better when there's motion
involved, we learn better when we

347
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:47,855
have real experience to hang
ideas off of. And that just makes

348
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:51,846
intuitive sense to me. That also
is why I say go practical. And

349
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:55,536
learn just enough theory to have
language ... to know when you need

350
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:56,586
to go deeper.

351
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,000
Bekah: I am [chuckles] -- so,
like, writing down, I -- you

352
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,736
just gave me a new talk idea,

352
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,605
and the title has to be like
motion and emotion. And it has

353
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:09,455
something to do with learning,
because I think both of those

354
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:13,746
things are, you know, does tie it
to our memory. It does allow us

355
00:22:13,806 --> 00:22:17,405
to connect with it in a different
way. And I know that there are

356
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:19,685
people out there, there were
people when I was learning that

357
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:23,306
would said, "We have to learn
how to think higher level

358
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:26,635
and theoretically, and how to
apply that." And I don't -- I mean,

359
00:22:26,726 --> 00:22:31,766
my background, I taught college
English for 10 years and so I- I

360
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:35,066
can think theoretically [chuckles].
It's something that I had to do, but

361
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:41,185
I don't think that we 'have' to
do that, you know? I- I think

362
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:44,306
that that's a little bit gatekeepy.

363
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,691
David: Absolutely. And- and it also
presupposes that there's only one

364
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:54,681
way to learn and only one way to
think. And- and that seems to be

365
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:59,090
an idea that was stronger years
ago, and now we know better, one

366
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,911
of those ideas. Now we recognize
that there's a whole spectrum of

367
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:06,020
how people think, and process
information, and learn, and

368
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,931
view, and interact with the
world, and experience the world.

369
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:12,921
Bekah: Yeah. And you have a- a lot
of experience with this, especially

370
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:16,461
at Virtual Coffee. For our
listeners who aren't in the

371
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:20,240
Slack, we have a co-working room
where anybody can join at any

372
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,230
time. And it's an open Zoom room.
And sometimes people are there to

373
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,351
hang out, sometimes people have
questions and they jump into

374
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:32,570
pair. And David i-is one of our
cur- our top co-working room

375
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,500
attendees, I think. And you've
helped a lot of different people

376
00:23:36,506 --> 00:23:39,945
in the co-working room. So,
first of all, thank you. And

377
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:42,855
second of all, you know, this all
ties into what we've been talking

378
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:46,006
about. How do you kind of
approach people who come in and

379
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:49,875
have questions? Because there are
so many different ways of, you

380
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:50,895
know, talking through things
and learning.

381
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:54,171
David: Oh, my gosh. Well, thank
you. I love the co-working room.

382
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:57,411
It's one of my favorite parts of
co- of Virtual Coffee and this

383
00:23:57,411 --> 00:24:02,151
community that you've created.
I never know what's gonna

384
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:04,221
happen when I go in there. But
I always know it's gonna be

385
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:04,500
friendly.

386
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Bekah: [Chuckles] Yeah.

387
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,790
David: And friendly faces. And
in the middle of a pandemic,

386
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:10,881
certainly, when I was locked in
my room, it was a lifesaver to be

387
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:15,635
able to dial it -- like, walking
virtually into a room and- and meet

388
00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:20,346
friendly people. And, one of
my favorite co-working room

389
00:24:20,346 --> 00:24:23,645
memories is I, you know, often
you go in and there's people who

390
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:26,016
are not sharing a screen and
they're just talking. Or

391
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:30,276
sometimes I go in and there's
people who are all on mute and

392
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:35,256
just enjoying being together. And
other times, I- I- I logged in once,

393
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:39,695
and Meg had her laptop on her front
porch and she was gardening. And I

394
00:24:39,701 --> 00:24:41,000
logged in another time
[Dan chuckles], and Aurelie

395
00:24:41,000--> 00:24:44,256
was making crepes [Bekah
chuckles] in

395
00:24:44,256 --> 00:24:48,215
her kitchen. It was lovely. So,
it blew open for me that this was

396
00:24:48,215 --> 00:24:51,935
really a- a place where people
could connect, which is ... at the

397
00:24:51,935 --> 00:24:57,846
heart of this community. But
to focus back, you asked about

398
00:24:57,846 --> 00:25:04,701
how do I approach ... pairing or
working with people from lo- a lots of

399
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:06,980
different backgrounds and lots of
different technology? Well, some

400
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,280
of it is cuz I've been doing this
for a long time, so I've seen a

401
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,861
bunch of things. I -- some of
it is that I'm in a job where I'm

402
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:19,875
actively working in several
different languages. And I'm

403
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:23,925
in a job where I'm working to
support developers. So I -- for

404
00:25:23,925 --> 00:25:26,955
five years, that's really been my
role. And even, Bekah, the other

405
00:25:26,955 --> 00:25:29,476
day you were talking about DevRel.
And I realized, some of what I've

406
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:33,465
been doing falls under that
bucket of really looking for ways

407
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:38,355
to help people who are having
problems. And I find there are

408
00:25:38,355 --> 00:25:43,905
some common threads, like a lot of
it is ... really slowing down my

409
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:48,050
thought process to take the
time to meet somebody in their

410
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:54,381
thought process as best I can. To
really try to hear ... not what I

411
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:58,340
think the problem is, but try to
hear what someone else thinks the

412
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,451
problem is, and try to look at it
from their point of view, as best

413
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:07,101
I can. And try to look with them
at whatever they're looking at.

414
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:09,441
So I will often say, "If you're
having trouble, can you share an

415
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:12,951
error message? Or can we share
a screen and I can look at the

416
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:18,590
same thing you are." Because words
becoming adequate for talking

417
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,310
about technical things. English
words in particular are so

418
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,000
imprecise sometimes. That we
can say the same word and mean

419
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,540
different things. So I often find
it really useful to share ... a

420
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:36,080
screen, and pair program, and look
at the sa- look at the same thing at

421
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:42,230
the same time, or to share a
stack trace, or a, you know, the --

422
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:47,181
an error message. That's really
useful. I think I've drifted from

423
00:26:47,361 --> 00:26:48,351
the heart of your question though.

424
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,151
Bekah: I mean, I think it's
great. I mean, you're really

425
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:54,441
taking a- a person-centered approach
to each person that comes into

426
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:58,550
that room. And the idea of like
listening and understanding is

427
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,601
something that I- I think a lot of
people struggle wh- struggle with.

428
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:05,451
Myself included. Because it's
like, "All right, let's just dive

429
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:10,340
into this," right? And get going
without, like, taking that time to

430
00:27:10,401 --> 00:27:12,800
understand what's happening
with the other person first.

431
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:20,810
David: I really think that's
important. At some point in

432
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:27,185
my growth and career, I discovered
the Agile Manifesto, and people

433
00:27:27,215 --> 00:27:30,185
have -- I've since read lots of
things, you know, positive and

434
00:27:30,185 --> 00:27:33,546
not so positive about the Agile
Manifesto. And I don't mean to go

435
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:38,346
down that rabbit hole, but the
first value statement really

436
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:42,125
stuck and resonated with me that
we value people and relationships

437
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:49,101
over processes and things. That
is kind of a radical idea. If

438
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:52,401
you- if you take that and nothing
else, that we value people in

439
00:27:52,401 --> 00:27:56,270
relationships over attachment
to any particular way of doing

440
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:00,770
things, and you start there, and
you really look to meet the other

441
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,351
people that you're working with,
no matter what their role is, no

442
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:06,471
matter what their background is,
and realize that we're all part

443
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:09,621
of a group or a team or a
community that's trying to

444
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:14,796
accomplish something together, I
think all of the other practices

445
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:19,266
around software development and
delivery can emerge. If you start

446
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:22,625
with who's at the table, then you
really make space for everybody

447
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:25,655
who's at the table. And that
could be a hard thing, cuz we're

448
00:28:25,655 --> 00:28:27,846
not always used to doing that.
There is a lot of gatekeepy,

449
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:33,905
like language and habits in
technology. I try to do my part

450
00:28:33,905 --> 00:28:35,346
to break that stuff down.

451
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:39,336
Bekah: Yeah, I think a lot of
times too -- sometimes it's

452
00:28:39,336 --> 00:28:42,996
certainly intentional and other
times it's not, it's- it's just

453
00:28:43,115 --> 00:28:48,066
habits that have built up
personally or through careers or

454
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:51,875
with the teams that you have
worked on before. So, you know,

455
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:57,215
there's a- a need for constantly
evaluating ourselves and how we

456
00:28:57,665 --> 00:29:00,786
approach the people that we are
talking to or working with.

457
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,000
David: I noticed something
else, too. That ... pairing,

458
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
really well, takes time --
takes me time.

458
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,871
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

458
00:29:11,871 --> 00:29:15,651
David: I have to really slow down, and
let go of any pressure, and really be

459
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:19,461
present with another person. And
that takes time, and energy, and

460
00:29:19,461 --> 00:29:24,711
effort. And if I'm under a
deadline to deliver something, it

461
00:29:24,711 --> 00:29:29,510
can be challenging to make that
time and that pressure. But I

462
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:35,556
think it is so worth it to ...
balance individual contribution,

463
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:39,756
and individual delivery, and
individual speed with all of the

464
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:43,266
rich benefits you get from
building community as you work.

465
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:45,905
And from building relationships,
and sharing knowledge, and

466
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:49,925
building experience, and
supporting everybody to grow in

467
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:55,145
confidence and skill. There's
so many benefits from actually

468
00:29:55,145 --> 00:29:55,955
working together.

469
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:59,961
Bekah: Absolutely. And next
month, our monthly challenge â€”

470
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:05,181
this will be in June â€” is Month of
Feedback. And so we read "Radical

471
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:08,030
Candor". I -- we've mentioned
it so many times. It's been a

472
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,090
favorite of ours. But when you're
working with so many different

473
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:15,320
people, you are providing a lot
of feedback and that can be hard

474
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,701
sometimes, right? Because that
feedback has to be critical. How

475
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:25,435
do you approach, you know, giving
honest feedback, but still supporting

476
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:28,375
the person that you are
providing the feedback to.

477
00:30:29,855 --> 00:30:33,036
David: That's a great question. I
started reading "Radical Candor"

478
00:30:33,276 --> 00:30:37,056
with someone on my team because
you have talked about it so much.

479
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:47,480
And it is the ... I struggle a
bit with the directness of

480
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,230
critical feedback. That's where I
found that book was really useful

481
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,411
in giving me some examples of
how to be direct without being

482
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:55,000
confrontational, right? And-

483
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

484
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,161
David: -to stay heart-centered,
to stay

483
00:30:58,161 --> 00:31:01,431
person-centered, and to really
have the other persons to be

484
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:07,665
committed to the other person. I
find I really practice the idea --

485
00:31:07,756 --> 00:31:10,125
well, practice which means I'm
not always good at it, but I work

486
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:17,536
at it. I practice the idea that
everybody is where they're at, on

487
00:31:17,536 --> 00:31:20,655
their own personal journey. And
everybody is right where they're

488
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:25,905
supposed to be in the moment. And
exactly the people that show up

489
00:31:25,905 --> 00:31:28,786
are the people who are supposed
to be there. And the people who

490
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,766
are on your team are the people
who are supposed to be there.

491
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:36,090
Like, really try to embrace, and
accept, and love what's happening.

492
00:31:36,451 --> 00:31:42,931
I think that's really important.
To be more practical though,

493
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:49,500
I find, still, I'm noticing a lot
of self-doubt and self-criticism

494
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,921
that happens in technology. And
so one of the things that I

495
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:57,030
really try to do when I'm pairing
is be encouraging. Above all else,

496
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:01,425
to be supportive and encouraging.
Because the biggest thing that I

497
00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:03,855
believe will help people learn
is to grow that confidence. That

498
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,496
it's okay to make a mistake.
It's okay not to know something.

499
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:09,615
That's actually part of the job.
And the faster that you are

500
00:32:09,615 --> 00:32:13,726
honest and open about what you
don't know as well as what you

501
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:17,236
know, then the faster that
everybody can see how to help you

502
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:22,036
and the faster you can learn. And
so I really just try to -- always

503
00:32:22,036 --> 00:32:26,236
try to be supportive, and patient,
and guide people towards what

504
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,576
seems to be the next step so
that they can build their

505
00:32:28,576 --> 00:32:31,365
understanding, and get stronger,
and bigger. Because that kind of

506
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:35,566
pairing, and feedback, and support,
it's not about me ... in that moment.

507
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:39,615
It's really about trying to work
with somebody and support them to

508
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:43,215
take whatever the next step
is for them. And if I'm deciding

509
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:49,185
what it is, then ... that's not
right. What I do sometimes

510
00:32:49,185 --> 00:32:52,965
though, is I might point people
in a direction. Based on the

511
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:55,951
journey that I've walked, I might
say, "You know, have you thought

512
00:32:55,951 --> 00:32:59,371
about this?" or "Let's go look at
that," or "I'd like --" yeah. I do more

513
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:02,490
direct coaching sometimes with
people on my team at work where I

514
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,300
say, "I'd like you to learn this,"
or "I'd like you to learn that."

515
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:11,671
You know, in that context, I feel
like there's a framework, and

516
00:33:11,675 --> 00:33:13,651
it's part of my role and
responsibility to be more

517
00:33:13,651 --> 00:33:18,211
directive. But I still try to
partner with people, always to

518
00:33:18,211 --> 00:33:22,111
say, "There's what you want to
learn and what you're interested

519
00:33:22,111 --> 00:33:25,171
in, and there's what I see as an
opportunity for you, and let's

520
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:30,030
bring those together and make
out a plan." It's in --

521
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:30,480
Bekah: Yeah, I love that.

522
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:31,230
David: Yeah?

523
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:34,471
Bekah: But -- I was just gonna say,
acknowledging the person where

524
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:37,711
they're at on the journey is a
huge part of that. And- and what

525
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:42,121
your relationship is with that
person. Because, for sure, we

526
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:45,570
communicate differently with
people we've been working with

527
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,441
for a while or somebody who's
new on the team or someone we're

528
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:53,250
meeting for the first time. You
know, all of these things play a

529
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,971
role into, I think, how we
provide feedback and what the

530
00:33:56,971 --> 00:34:03,780
expectations are ... of us, you know?
If I ... am resop- responding to

531
00:34:03,786 --> 00:34:07,141
a student's paper, there's an
expectation of how I'll respond

532
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:10,081
to that paper, versus if somebody
says, "Hey, can you give me

533
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:13,561
feedback on my blog post?" it's
going to be a little bit

534
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:16,561
different. I'm going to provide
feedback either way, but the tone

535
00:34:16,561 --> 00:34:18,030
is going to change, for sure.

536
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:22,445
David: But through it all,
that concept of people and

537
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:26,221
relationships first is really
important. Like -- and that's what

538
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:30,331
I have enjoyed about, the part of
"Radical Candor" that I've managed

539
00:34:30,331 --> 00:34:33,721
to read so far, is that it does
start with that people-centered

540
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:40,260
approach. And that ... valuing
the person that you're giving

541
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,710
feedback to you and valuing the
relationship for what it is, not

542
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,740
needing to make it something that
it isn't, in whatever context, but

543
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:51,331
valuing it for what it is. And
valuing that the other person

544
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,170
involved is a human on a journey,
just like you're a human on a

545
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:59,791
journey. And, you know, there was
a time when I didn't know what I

546
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:02,581
was doing and people were
gracious with me. So I tried to

547
00:35:02,581 --> 00:35:06,391
return that favor. Pay it
forward, in that sense.

548
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:12,690
Dan: Yeah. And I- I'd say another-
another ... another piece of

549
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,501
this is, you know, when you
talk about meeting people where

550
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:19,920
they are and things like that, it
helps when you know them [chuckles]

551
00:35:20,431 --> 00:35:24,300
already, right? I-it's easier to
have connections when you ...

552
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,000
well, I was gonna say when you
are connected, I don't know

553
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,101
[Dan and Bekah chuckle]. I

553
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:31,050
dunno. That sentence kind of broke
down in the middle there. But ...

554
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,681
I was thinking about two
things when- when- when you were

555
00:35:34,681 --> 00:35:37,000
talking. Fun thing, Bek- Bekah
and I worked to-together --

556
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,016
and I don't even know why I

556
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:43,096
brought this up, but [chuckles] Bekah
and I worked together. And it took

557
00:35:43,096 --> 00:35:45,556
us -- I dunno. How long do you
think it took us before -- I mean,

558
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:47,686
at least a year or something
before we were really like --

559
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:50,000
Bekah: I feel like right before
the pandemic hit-

560
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Dan: [Chuckles] Oh, yeah. Right.
Yeah.

560
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Bekah: -we were like eight
months in, and we, like, we

561
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,940
finally hit that stride. And

561
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,000
then- and then [chuckles] ...
and kinda messed up.

562
00:35:55,666 --> 00:36:00,900
Dan: Yeah. And- and some of- and
some of that is like ... some of

563
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,490
it is me -- you know, so Bekah had
just started in- in like, in dev and

564
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,101
had just kind of gotten outta
bootcamp and stuff. And so some

565
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:10,621
of it was me, like, learning how
to do that better, you know?

566
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:13,681
Learning to do all the stuff
that David's just talking about.

567
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:18,181
And some of it I think is- is
just that connection over time,

568
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:21,210
you know, kind of just grows,
and grows stronger. And that's

569
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:25,260
another thing I appreciate about
Virtual Coffee and- and I- I think

570
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,590
it helps is, when you know
people, you know, it's- it's-

571
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:35,280
it's a little bit ... easier to do
this [chuckles], I guess. And to get

572
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,800
practice at it when you know a
person. And so- so you don't have

573
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,760
to maybe necessarily -- like, I- I
-- when I pair with somebody, I've

574
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,161
paired with people, you know,
kind of cold, right? So, people I

575
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,530
don't know, and for the
first time, and there's always a

576
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,681
bit of like level setting, you
know? And I- and I- I try to be

577
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:52,351
very -- I mean, I- I wanna be very
careful about it. And I, you know,

578
00:36:52,356 --> 00:36:57,510
it's ... like, you- you don't wanna
assume that they -- that a person knows

579
00:36:57,661 --> 00:36:59,641
things that they don't know, you
don't wanna assume that they don't

580
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:03,090
know anything either, right? And
so, it's that like -- it's that --

581
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,000
I- I just -- I called it level
setting cuz I'm like -- a-and

582
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,931
I've -- now I've just

582
00:37:06,936 --> 00:37:11,041
started explicit do-doing it. Like,
I- I- I wanna be very like clear

583
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,471
that I'm, you know, I- I just
wanna figure out where we are,

584
00:37:13,476 --> 00:37:16,590
you know, where you are, where-
where, like, what level I can talk

585
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,590
at, you know? And it's --
there's no judgment at, you know?

586
00:37:19,621 --> 00:37:24,690
It's just what -- it's just somebody
who's just learning for the first

587
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,641
time is gonna have different
questions and different thought

588
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:30,931
processes than somebody who maybe
is a Ruby expert, but is just

589
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:33,001
starting a JavaScript. That
person is going to have completely

590
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:37,170
different questions, you know?
You know, and- and so, it's

591
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,320
always ... I don't know. It's
always kind of interesting to --

592
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,621
when you're connecting with
different people. So when you

593
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:46,471
have a -- when you're at work and
you're in a team, kind of, you build

594
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:52,936
a rapport over- over time, right?
And when you are in a lot of

595
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:56,175
random internet communities, you
can still be valuable and you can

596
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:58,335
still have valuable connections
with people you don't know.

597
00:37:58,755 --> 00:37:59,295
For sure. But --

598
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:03,090
David: Well, this overlaps, I
think, with- with you were

599
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:06,885
talking about, Bekah, in that
DevRel session you gave the

600
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,315
other day, too. That there's a
part of community building and a

601
00:38:09,315 --> 00:38:16,215
part of developer relations that is
... going out and reaching out to

602
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:19,065
people that are not yet a part
of the community. And trying to

603
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:24,465
create an opening ... connection
with somebody that you don't

604
00:38:24,465 --> 00:38:28,876
know. Dan, as you were talking,
I'm reminded that one of

605
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:32,295
the things that constantly
surprises me still, years later,

606
00:38:32,565 --> 00:38:36,045
when I -- about software development
is how long it takes to get

607
00:38:36,045 --> 00:38:40,695
started with new people.
Especially with new people. When I-

608
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:40,695
Dan: Mm-hmm.

608
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:44,445
David: -sit down to pair with a new
person, say, a new person joins my

609
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:46,965
team, or I'm in the co-working
room for the first time with

610
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:53,010
somebody new, it's not
unreasonable to take one to three

611
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:58,530
hours to just set out your
machines to work in this -- a

612
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:02,971
compatible way, and set up your
language like you were talking

613
00:39:02,971 --> 00:39:08,851
about, to figure out what level of
detail and abstraction to speak at.

614
00:39:08,851 --> 00:39:09,675
Dan: Right, right.

614
00:39:09,675 --> 00:39:13,666
David: And hear each other, and to
develop a common understanding of

615
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:17,476
the problem, and to work through
build and compile issues in a new

616
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:22,005
environment. Like, all these things
that are not typing, that are not-

617
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:24,000
Dan: [Chuckles] Yes. Yes. 

617
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:26,056
David: -reading and writing code,
become really, really important

618
00:39:26,356 --> 00:39:31,155
and take real time when you care
about the relationships of the

619
00:39:31,155 --> 00:39:34,905
people you're working with. And
I'm constantly surprised by, you

620
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:40,936
know, how little I get da- how
little progress we make in the

621
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:45,585
code when I sit down to pair
with people at work, say, for

622
00:39:45,585 --> 00:39:46,000
the first time.

623
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Dan: Absolutely.

624
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,835
David: And how much time it
takes to build that initial

623
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:53,925
rapport, and common ground, and
common language, and common

624
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:57,286
environment. And the reason I
keep talking about it here is cuz

625
00:39:57,315 --> 00:40:00,226
I really want to normalize it for
anybody who's listening. If you

626
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:04,005
try pair programming and you sit
down with another human, expect

627
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:06,826
it, to be awkward, at first.

628
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:07,951
Dan: Yeah.

629
00:40:08,326 --> 00:40:10,726
David: I-it will be. And that's okay.
That doesn't mean you're doing it

630
00:40:10,726 --> 00:40:13,275
wrong. And that doesn't mean
you're failing. It -- that's part --

631
00:40:13,306 --> 00:40:16,666
that means it's working. That's
part of figuring out how to work

632
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:19,936
together with another human. And
it does -- it's like any other

633
00:40:19,936 --> 00:40:24,195
muscle or skill. It does get
easier over time. Dan, you spoke

634
00:40:24,201 --> 00:40:27,525
about, you know, you- you're
working to get better at how to

635
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:31,545
ask those questions more
directly. How to figure out and

636
00:40:31,545 --> 00:40:35,896
navigate that awkwardness faster.
I- I ha- I feel like I can navigate

637
00:40:35,896 --> 00:40:36,766
it faster now than --

638
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:38,000
Dan: Yes, absolutely.

639
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Bekah: I think --

640
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,766
Dan: Yeah. You're saying?

639
00:40:39,766 --> 00:40:43,396
Bekah: You know, coming from the
other perspective. Like, it's-

640
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:47,235
it's a two way conversation,
right? And so, when you're first

641
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,686
starting out, it can be really
hard to ask those questions. And

642
00:40:50,686 --> 00:40:53,146
if there's anything, I feel like
I've learned over the last couple

643
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:56,715
of years, it's ask those
questions, whether or not you

644
00:40:56,715 --> 00:41:01,635
think it's gonna make you sound
ridiculous or incapable. You're

645
00:41:01,635 --> 00:41:06,226
going to learn and grow faster
that way. And so, you know,

646
00:41:06,556 --> 00:41:10,755
having those conversations and
being open about where you are

647
00:41:10,755 --> 00:41:15,195
too, if you're on the other side
of that- that pairing screen is

648
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:19,936
essential. Do you have any tips
for people who are on that side

649
00:41:19,965 --> 00:41:23,445
of the screen? So opposite of you,
David, about like how- how do you

650
00:41:23,445 --> 00:41:27,496
ask those questions or what can
help make this a successful

651
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:31,005
session by having these -- this
conversation?

652
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:35,240
David: Well, I like everything
you just said, Bekah. All of that

653
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,900
is really important. Asking
questions. The faster you ask a

654
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,900
question, the faster you'll find
out if the person that you're

655
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:47,251
pairing with i-is, you know, how
they're gonna react to you? And

656
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:49,471
the faster you'll find out if
that's gonna work for you, and

657
00:41:49,471 --> 00:41:52,380
it's gonna be a pairing session
that you wanna stick with. Or if

658
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,541
the person's not gonna treat you
well, not in a place where they

659
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:57,360
have the skills to treat you
well, and- and you can get out of

660
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,840
there, right? The faster -- it's
all about feedback and shortening

661
00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:03,840
feedback loops. So that's one part
of it. It's the faster you can

662
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,780
ask questions, the faster you can
say what you know, the faster

663
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,751
you can say what you don't know
without, you know, with as little

664
00:42:09,751 --> 00:42:13,485
emotion or ... I mean, we're all
emotional people. I don't mean to

665
00:42:13,485 --> 00:42:17,175
say you have to be abstract. But
there's that thing that we do

666
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:20,000
sometimes ... I've done it
when I was learning Indonesian,

667
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,215
I did it. When I was

667
00:42:22,215 --> 00:42:26,476
almost embarrassed to share what
I knew, embarrassed to try to

668
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:29,775
speak in a new language. And I
think it's very similar with

669
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:32,326
technology. If you're not
familiar with language or

670
00:42:32,326 --> 00:42:37,456
concepts, it can feel
embarrassing to try. But please

671
00:42:37,456 --> 00:42:41,235
do. The faster you try and the-
the faster you take risks, the

672
00:42:41,235 --> 00:42:44,085
faster you'll find out who will
support you in those risks. And-

673
00:42:44,235 --> 00:42:46,096
and how fast you can grow.

674
00:42:46,936 --> 00:42:47,000
Dan: Yeah.

675
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Bekah: That's great.

676
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,146
Dan: And I just wanted to add,
that- that advice applies not

675
00:42:50,146 --> 00:42:53,235
just to beginners too. It's --
it can be embarrassing for me.

676
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:55,576
I mean, I can feel that
embarrassment, you know, trying

677
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:59,626
new things, and- and- and some
hesitancy, and things like

678
00:42:59,626 --> 00:43:02,865
that [chuckles]. So, it's great advice.
I just did -- and it applies to everybody

679
00:43:02,865 --> 00:43:04,755
and we all go through it. You
know what I mean? So --

680
00:43:05,146 --> 00:43:07,306
David: And we go -- that's
important that you bring up, Dan.

681
00:43:07,306 --> 00:43:09,945
Cuz we go through it, not just
once. It's not just something you

682
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:10,500
go through-

683
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,000
Dan: Right, right.

684
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,460
David: -as you're entering
your technology career. And

683
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,880
that's why it's so important to
get practiced at it. Because you

684
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,780
will experience that throughout
your career. Cuz we're always

685
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,840
learning and technologies are
always frame- changing. New

686
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,311
frameworks, new libraries. You
mentioned earlier, a JavaScript

687
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:34,380
or a Java developer who was
learning Ruby, I think? And ...

688
00:43:35,085 --> 00:43:38,175
when I first started learning Go
-- I've programmed C# for years,

689
00:43:38,175 --> 00:43:40,755
when I first started learning Go, I
bang my head against things. It felt

690
00:43:40,755 --> 00:43:45,976
awkward, didn't know how to ask
questions. I have been known

691
00:43:45,976 --> 00:43:51,376
to rant about TypeScript [Bekah chuckles]
and Webpack in Virtual Coffee

692
00:43:51,376 --> 00:43:57,916
threads. And I kind of laugh
as I do that because that's me

693
00:43:57,916 --> 00:44:02,925
where I could- I could write C#,
cold, probably in -- from

694
00:44:02,925 --> 00:44:05,835
memory, from just having -- like, I
know the syntax so well, cuz I've

695
00:44:05,835 --> 00:44:08,266
done it so long. And I can't
for the life of me, figure out

696
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:09,766
Webpack. Or --

698
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:13,351
and I struggle with TypeScript
bindings. And I was

699
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:16,231
working with JavaScript back
before it was popular. So, you --

700
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:21,570
Dan: Nobody understands Webpack, David.
[David and Dan laugh] It's okay.

701
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:25,081
David: It's good to have community
in that [Bekah chuckles]. But yeah,

702
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:28,380
every- every time you go to -- every
time I've gone to a new project

703
00:44:28,411 --> 00:44:31,351
or gone to a new company or
changed jobs, there's that

704
00:44:31,351 --> 00:44:33,990
learning curve again. Every time
I pair with somebody new, there's

705
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:39,766
that learning curve. I was just
banging my head this past weekend

706
00:44:39,766 --> 00:44:43,635
against one of the old advent of
code problems. And feeling like I

707
00:44:43,635 --> 00:44:45,795
don't know what I'm doing, you
know? And I've been doing this a

708
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,826
long time. So by getting comfortable
with that feeling is really

709
00:44:48,826 --> 00:44:49,335
valuable.

710
00:44:49,695 --> 00:44:49,905
Dan: Yeah.

711
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:52,036
David: It's good- good work to
practice.

712
00:44:53,385 --> 00:44:55,726
Dan: Agreed. Yeah. I'm- I'm
digging into TypeScript for

713
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:58,485
really the first time over the
last month or two, too. So we have --

714
00:44:58,815 --> 00:45:02,056
TypeScript Tuesdays is my little
plug. [Laughs] Every Tuesday at 2:00

715
00:45:02,056 --> 00:45:05,925
PM Eastern with Kirk, who
is -- who's like a, you

716
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:09,525
know, he's- he's done a lot of --
he- he is a fan of, you know,

717
00:45:09,525 --> 00:45:13,981
strongly type things. And I have
been ... long time not fan of

718
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:16,000
that, so [laughs] ... but some
of it- some of it is --

719
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,940
voiding [??] it is- is, you

719
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:20,190
know, you open -- I open up --
I've been writing JavaScript for

720
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,831
I've years. I open up a TypeScript
file and I'm like, "This looks like

721
00:45:23,701 --> 00:45:24,000
... nonsense to me."

722
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
David: A-ha. Thank you [laughs]
[clap hands].

723
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,701
Dan: I can't understand it,
and I close it. But

722
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:30,721
I -- and I- and I, like, I'm --
in-instead of like digging in or asking

723
00:45:30,721 --> 00:45:33,360
questions and making myself, you
know, possibly look like I don't

724
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,000
know everything, I close it
and run away, and say,

725
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,351
"TypeScript is dumb [Bekah
chuckles]. It- it's

725
00:45:37,356 --> 00:45:39,000
dumb [chuckles]," you know?
[David laughs] That's what

726
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,010
I've done for the last 10
years or

726
00:45:41,016 --> 00:45:44,010
whatever. And so, finally I was
like, "Okay. Let's- let's- let's

727
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,271
dig in." And so -- you know
what I mean? Yeah.

728
00:45:45,496 --> 00:45:48,735
David: Okay. And full on every
time I've ranted about Webpack,

729
00:45:48,735 --> 00:45:52,126
or TypeScript, I'm aware that
it's because I haven't spent

730
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:52,800
the time to learn it.

731
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Dan: [All laugh] Yeah.

732
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,545
David: [Laughs] Sometimes it's fun
to put on that grumpy old man hat-

733
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,545
Dan: Oh, absolutely.

731
00:45:58,545 --> 00:46:01,065
David: -and say, "Yeah, I've been
programming JavaScript since

732
00:46:01,065 --> 00:46:03,000
before there were types. I
don't -- who needs types

733
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,246
[Bekah chuckles]? Like,
write your

733
00:46:04,246 --> 00:46:09,000
angle brackets. I -- whatever
[David and Dan laugh]." No.

734
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,106
It's -- but none of that one
does like --

734
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,686
really, there's an element of
humility that's important to

735
00:46:13,686 --> 00:46:17,016
practice in this industry. Because
there's so much lack of humility

736
00:46:17,315 --> 00:46:20,945
abounds, arrogance abounds,
gatekeeping abounds. And

737
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:24,065
anything we can do to be humble
with each other and really

738
00:46:24,065 --> 00:46:28,445
support each other ... to work
together and to grow together

739
00:46:28,445 --> 00:46:30,396
is a- a net positive. That's
[unintelligible].

740
00:46:30,646 --> 00:46:34,306
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. And- and I think
a lot of that arrogance, and

741
00:46:34,786 --> 00:46:38,985
gatekeeping, and some -- i-i-is- is
because -- the root cause of it is

742
00:46:38,985 --> 00:46:39,000
insecurity, right?

743
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

744
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,530
Dan: And- and not wanting to-
not wanting to look ... dumber.

743
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,440
Look like you don't know things
[chuckles]. And I've- I've fallen in

744
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,621
that trap. I- I try, like -- I don't-
I don't know. Maybe I- I haven't-

745
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,170
haven't noticed. But I- I don't
usually -- for me it doesn't

746
00:46:52,231 --> 00:46:55,021
manifest as gatekeeping,
hopefully, or things like

747
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:57,931
that. It just manifests me avoiding
topics [chuckles]. I don't wanna- I

748
00:46:57,931 --> 00:47:00,300
don't wanna, you know, learn or
don't know or whatever, you know?

749
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:06,811
And that practicing humility
and practicing ... admitting or-

750
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:10,666
or, you know, being public about
not knowing things is- is been

751
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:12,556
something I've been personally
working on for the last couple

752
00:47:12,556 --> 00:47:15,000
years. And- and it's -- and
it feels good once you-

753
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,585
[chuckles] once you turn the

753
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:18,135
corner. Once you realize it
doesn't actually like-

754
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:18,195
David: No.

754
00:47:18,195 --> 00:47:21,000
Dan: -you know, hurt to not
know, literally, everything

755
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,005
in the world [laughs].

755
00:47:22,365 --> 00:47:25,306
Bekah: What I will say too, one of
the greatest learning experiences

756
00:47:25,306 --> 00:47:29,806
I've had over the past couple
years is watching conversations

757
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:34,096
in Slack between people who I
see as experts in the field

758
00:47:34,246 --> 00:47:37,335
asking each other questions,
right? Like, "Oh, okay. This is

759
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,766
how you ask that question." Or,
you know, "They don't know

760
00:47:39,766 --> 00:47:43,876
everything." And that does help
provide more of an awareness that

761
00:47:43,965 --> 00:47:45,615
I can ask those questions too.

762
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,561
David: Hmm. That reminds me. I wanna
go back to that -- a part of the

763
00:47:49,561 --> 00:47:51,900
question that you asked, Bekah,
that we didn't really address.

764
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:58,260
Which is what makes a good question.
And ... [clear throat] if you think

765
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:03,360
about everything we've been
talking about, the faster you can

766
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:10,050
help somebody ... acclimatize to how
to speak to you, the faster you'll

767
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:13,141
get your question answered. And
so how do you do that? You learn

768
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:16,860
to add more detail in the
question, which is like your

769
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,010
initial offering to somebody.
When you're asking somebody for

770
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,911
help, the more you can put into
that question to say, "I thought

771
00:48:23,911 --> 00:48:28,681
about this," "I tried this,"
"Here's the command I used," "Here's

772
00:48:28,681 --> 00:48:33,181
the output that I got." Like,
the more language that you use,

773
00:48:33,181 --> 00:48:35,550
often it's a better question.
Because you're giving somebody

774
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:39,121
more context and the ability to
understand better where you're at,

775
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:43,561
and what you're really dealing
with. I- I get questions in my

776
00:48:43,561 --> 00:48:46,501
job. Sometimes I get questions
like, "The integration environment

777
00:48:46,505 --> 00:48:48,000
is down." [Bekah and Dan
chuckle] And I look at that,

778
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,447
and I say, "Okay, thank you
[chuckles]." [Cough] The

778
00:48:52,447 --> 00:48:59,257
integration environment where
I work has probably like 75

779
00:48:59,257 --> 00:49:02,976
microservices or more, across --
like, grouped into several different

780
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:06,007
applications. And so, integration
is down could mean any number of

781
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:10,686
things. Are -- is that a -- is -- are
you getting an- an authentication

782
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:14,347
error? Is that a, you know, do
you have an HTTP status code you

783
00:49:14,347 --> 00:49:17,496
can share? Do you have -- can you
tell me what application was

784
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:20,586
trying to call what application?
Can you tell me what was the

785
00:49:20,586 --> 00:49:24,092
actual response you got? What was
compared to the expected response

786
00:49:24,092 --> 00:49:26,581
you got? Can you tell me what
language you're working in? Can

787
00:49:26,581 --> 00:49:29,222
you tell me what version of the
language you're working in? Can

788
00:49:29,222 --> 00:49:31,831
you tell me what libraries and
tools you're using that might be

789
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:35,431
relevant? You know, all of that
detail is helpful. Partly cuz it

790
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:39,092
teaches the people who might
answer your question what

791
00:49:39,097 --> 00:49:41,942
language they can use with you,
because you're exposing what

792
00:49:41,942 --> 00:49:46,882
language you know. And it's also
giving people more ... detail to

793
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:49,851
hang onto. There are problems
that I can solve. And I have done

794
00:49:49,851 --> 00:49:52,911
in our Virtual Coffee Slack,
where just seeing the error

795
00:49:52,911 --> 00:49:55,311
message reminds me of something
I've already seen. And I can

796
00:49:55,311 --> 00:49:58,041
point somebody without even
needing to be at a computer or

797
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:01,461
look at their screen. I can at
least offer a few keywords or

798
00:50:01,461 --> 00:50:04,132
say, "Go try this," or, "Go try
that," you know? And sometimes

799
00:50:04,132 --> 00:50:06,000
that's enough to unblock
somebody. But if-

800
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Dan: Absolutely.

800
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
David: -if the person who
asked the question didn't

801
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,981
include the actual error
message, then

801
00:50:12,987 --> 00:50:17,541
I've seen also where that can turn
into a thread of 55 messages long

802
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:20,000
with people talking past each
other. So-

803
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Bekah: Yeah.

803
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
David: -as somebody who wants
to ask a question, I don't

804
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,461
expect you to have solved the
problem.

804
00:50:25,641 --> 00:50:28,461
It's not this idea that, you
know, "Don't come to me with

805
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:30,742
problems. Only come to me with
solutions." Like, it's not that

806
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:36,202
business. Not at all. But it's
... share with me what you've

807
00:50:36,202 --> 00:50:37,000
already thought about.

808
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Dan: Totally.

809
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,407
David: And share with me as
much detail as you can about

808
00:50:41,407 --> 00:50:44,226
what you know and what you don't
know. About the problem that

809
00:50:44,226 --> 00:50:49,777
you're asking. Cuz that will
help me learn ... where you're

810
00:50:49,777 --> 00:50:52,146
struggling and how to speak to
you about it.

811
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,597
Bekah: Yeah. Thank you so much
for being here with us today,

812
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:58,626
David. This was just fantastic.
I feel like we could have done

813
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:01,927
three hours worth of this
conversation. But I do appreciate

814
00:51:01,927 --> 00:51:05,586
your time and thanks for
helping us to kick off our new

815
00:51:05,586 --> 00:51:05,786
season.

816
00:51:06,501 --> 00:51:07,461
David: Oh, my pleasure.

817
00:51:08,092 --> 00:51:13,494
Dan: Yeah. Thank you, David.
