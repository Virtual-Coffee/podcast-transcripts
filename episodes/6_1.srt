00:00:06,535 --> 00:00:10,555
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 6, Episode 1

2
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:13,105
of the Virtual Coffee Podcast.
I'm Bekah--

3
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,315
Dan Ott: Woohoo! [Dan and Bekah
chuckle] We're back!

4
00:00:18,356 --> 00:00:22,495
Bekah: We are back. We are back
featuring members of the

5
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:26,175
Virtual Coffee community. A
community that is an intimate

6
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:27,905
group of developers at all
stages of their coding journey.

7
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:29,635
And

8
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:32,045
they're here, on this podcast,
sharing their stories and what

9
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:36,000
they've learned. And we're here
to share it with you. Obviously,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,240
here with me today [chuckles] is
my co-host, Dan.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,256
Dan: Wuddup, Bek. How's it
going?

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,210
Bekah: Do you do that every
Season 1 intro?

13
00:00:46,856 --> 00:00:50,000
Dan: I ... hope so. Probably
not. But now I will.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Bekah: Yeah.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,930
Dan: From here on out. Yes.

16
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,000
Bekah: Will you remember that,
in Season 7?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Dan: No.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,960
Bekah: Hmm. Okay.

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,670
Dan: But, it probably won't be
the only time I say, 'Wuddup,

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,926
Bek,' [Bekah chuckles] either,
so-- you know? How's it going?

21
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:06,251
Bekah: It's going great! Because
we're launching the

22
00:01:06,251 --> 00:01:07,240
new season of the podcast.

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,000
Dan: Woohoo! [Dan and Bekah
chuckle] Yes, we are. It was--

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,921
Season 5 was pretty awesome.

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,215
And Season 6 is also gonna be
awesome [chuckles].

26
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:22,788
Bekah: It is true. It is always
awesome. We are consistent in

27
00:01:22,788 --> 00:01:24,221
one

28
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:28,240
thing, and one thing only. And
it is having awesome people on

29
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:28,786
our podcast.

30
00:01:29,305 --> 00:01:35,141
Dan: Yes. Agreed. So yeah. So we
are starting Season 6 off

31
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,935
with ... an awesome guest
[laughs], of the name, David

32
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:42,520
Alpert. David is

33
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:47,021
a director-- no, wait. What is
he? I lost it. David is the

34
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:51,971
Director of Engineering, sorry,
at Northfield IT. And one of

35
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:56,740
the many Canadians we have in
Virtual Coffee, and also on the

36
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,380
podcast [chuckles]. Not the
first, won't be the last. And--

37
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,020
yeah, we had

38
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,686
a really great time talking to
David.

39
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:06,835
Bekah: Yeah. David is one of
those conversations that could

40
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:11,126
have continued on, for sure,
beyond the hour. He has so much

41
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:13,660
insight into-- not just, like,
the technology field, but in

42
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,164
working

43
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:21,116
with other people. And he-- I
really appreciated his

44
00:02:21,116 --> 00:02:25,855
thoughtfulness in how he
approaches other people and

45
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:26,575
supporting them.

46
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:28,645
Dan: Yeah. Absolutely. That-- I
mean, like, that- that's gotta

47
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:29,484
be one of

48
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:31,232
the first things I think of when
I-- when I think of David is-

49
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:32,979
is-- yeah,

50
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,020
thoughtfulness, and- and ... I
don't know. I-- you know, like,

51
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,375
thoughtful and- and empathetic
is- is-- what the-- he's one

52
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,400
of the-- I mean,

53
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:45,610
he's- he's always on Slack, and
he's ... I- [chuckles] I dunno.

54
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,819
Like,

55
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,230
everybody loves him. He's always
so great to talk to. Anytime

56
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,640
you--

57
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,711
anytime you're kinda working
through something or have some

58
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,000
existential crisis [chuckles]-

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Bekah: Yeah.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Dan: -I feel like David's one of
those-- one of those people

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,841
that will show up and ... you
know, act- like, actually

62
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:04,211
have constructive ways to maybe
work through some- some hard

63
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:06,312
problems and stuff. It's- it's
really-- it's really nice having

64
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:06,973
him around.

65
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:11,950
Bekah: Yeah. And- and the-- that
empathy that he brings to

66
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:19,181
the situation is really ...
authentic and true, you know?

67
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:22,121
Somebody might check in and see
how you're doing but, you know,

68
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:25,781
if you get a message from David,
he means that. And I think that

69
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:29,381
goes a long way to supporting
people, and helping them feel

70
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:34,000
comfortable, and allowing them
to, you know, grow and- and

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,651
learn in those ways, and support
them.

72
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:44,027
Dan: Absolutely. Okay. What is
our random question? How do

73
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:45,000
we start the episode [chuckles]?
Bekah, how are we

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,907
gonna start this episode
[chuckles]?

75
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:49,473
Bekah: [Chuckles] Well ...
well--

76
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:51,203
Dan: [Laughs] I don't know.

77
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:58,447
Bekah: Why don't- why don't we,
in the first episode, intro

78
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,796
talk about the other guests too?

79
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:05,000
Dan: Oh, totally. Yeah. [Bekah
and Dan chuckle] I don't

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,149
know. I haven't done this for a
while.

81
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:10,209
Bekah: We're excited about this
episode and the rest of the

82
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:16,418
season. So, we're also going to
be talking to ... Bogdan about

83
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,959
navigating tech career paths. We
have quite a bit of career path

84
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,649
episodes this season. So, we're
gonna be learning about what it

85
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:28,872
means to be a demo engineer, a
developer educator, we're gonna

86
00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:30,762
be talking through interviews,
and open source contributions.

87
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:32,652
So I

88
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:36,327
think this is a pretty well
rounded season to ... I don't

89
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:40,001
know ...

90
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:42,000
get you excited about all
things.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Dan: Yeah. I'm excited about all
things.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,973
Bekah: Am I spinning chair? I've
got a spinny chair this season.

93
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,838
Dan: You have-- yes. Bekah got a
spinny chair and she has not

94
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:50,127
stopped spinning since she got
it [chuckles].

95
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:52,632
Bekah: It is the best thing. I
just continue to spin.

96
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:56,788
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. It's- it's--
well, it is what it is. I feel

97
00:04:56,788 --> 00:05:00,387
like you're doing a good job of,
like, rotating around your

98
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:01,722
microphone and staying in a good
speaking position though.

99
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:03,057
Though--

100
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,047
Bekah: Yeah. I'm trying to keep
my head straight on the

101
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:04,886
microphone. See-

102
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:05,908
Dan: So, well done. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

103
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:07,827
Bekah: -my body turns, but my
head ... do- does minimal

104
00:05:07,827 --> 00:05:09,746
turning.

105
00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:12,958
Dan: Yeah. No. It's-- you--
you're doing a good job.

106
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:19,192
Bekah: Thanks. That's all I
needed to hear today. But we are

107
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:23,182
going to start this episode of
the podcast like we start every

108
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:27,141
episode of the podcast and every
Virtual Coffee. Say our name,

109
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:30,831
where we're from, what we do,
and answer a random check-in

110
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,281
question. So we hope you enjoyed
this episode and the rest of

111
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:39,663
Season 6. Today's random
check-in question is, if you

112
00:05:39,663 --> 00:05:45,045
could

113
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:50,055
magically become fluent in any
language, what would it be? My

114
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:55,005
name is Bekah. I am a technical
community builder from a small

115
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:59,763
town in Ohio, and ... I think I
would go with Polish, only

116
00:05:59,763 --> 00:06:04,515
because I'm

117
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:07,343
mostly Polish and I would like
to know more of it. It's

118
00:06:07,343 --> 00:06:10,170
definitely not

119
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,831
the most practical, but it's
probably the most meaningful.

120
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,709
Dan: All right, Polish.

121
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:18,949
Bekah: Yes. See? That was the
most straightforward-

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,500
Dan: [Laughs] Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
I know, I know [chuckles]. I

123
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,000
don't--

124
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:19,750
Bekah: -I've ever been in an
intro.

125
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,910
Dan: Yeah. Okay. Hi, I'm Dan. I
do web development things

126
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:32,420
in Cleveland. And-- yeah. I
don't know. Languages are hard.

127
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,310
I-- this is an attractive
question to me because I-- I'm

128
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,870
bad

129
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,085
at, like, learning languages. I
took, like, three years of

130
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:38,300
German,

131
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,000
and, like, I struggled with
Spanish in college, and I

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,139
don't-- I took three

133
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,804
years of German. I don't know. I
can still count to 10, I think.

134
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,409
But,

135
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,600
you know, Spanish would be-- I
think-- I think I'm gonna choose

136
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,100
Spanish. I, you know, it just,
it-- I- I like going to

137
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,000
Mexican restaurants [chuckles].
I like, you know-- and there-

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,310
there's a lot of Spanish

139
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,269
speaking people, you know, in
America. And although

140
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:01,204
Japanese would be cool too. I- I
love, like, listening to

141
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:03,079
Japanese,

142
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,768
you know, people speaking
Japanese. I like-- I just like

143
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,239
the way it sounds. So, that'd be
cool too. And- and it's so

144
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:09,709
different

145
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,319
than English that, you know,
that's one-- that's really hard

146
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:14,149
for me to wrap my head around
ever ... being able to speak

147
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:15,919
[chuckles]. So

148
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,470
I'm- I'm kind of tied 50-50,
Spanish and Japanese. That's

149
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,069
gonna be my answer.

150
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:22,770
David Alpert: Well, since Dan
said to you, I'm gonna say to

151
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,675
you. My

152
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:29,415
name is David Alpert. And I'm-
I'm a software developer and

153
00:07:29,444 --> 00:07:36,019
DevOps engineer in Winnipeg,
Manitoba. And I was having a

154
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:39,000
hard time picking just one. So
since Dan set the example-

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Dan: Yeah.

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
David: -my first thought was
Indonesian. Because I spent

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,189
some time in Indonesia and

158
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:45,486
I remember just enough
Indonesian to say some things to

159
00:07:45,486 --> 00:07:47,778
Ayu, for

160
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:49,669
example, in our community. But
I'm no-- by no means, fluent.

161
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,559
And it

162
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,910
would just be so much fun to be
fluent a-again or more in

163
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,064
Indonesian. But then, Bekah,
when you mentioned Polish, I- I

164
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,624
thought Hebrew because that
would connect me with some of my

165
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:03,184
family

166
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:06,904
and some of my tradition, so--
that I've drifted a little

167
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,125
bit from. So, Hebrew and
Indonesian.

168
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:10,415
Dan: I like it.

169
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:10,774
David: I will go there.

170
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,709
Bekah: Yeah. Thanks, David.
Normally, I- I ask our guests to

171
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,119
choose one thing, and then I
choose four or five. So

172
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:18,529
[chuckles]--

173
00:08:19,894 --> 00:08:21,175
David: So we turned the tables
today.

174
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:23,959
Bekah: Yeah. Welcome to the
podcast. Thanks so much for

175
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,339
being

176
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:29,779
here with us today. We always
like to start with the origin

177
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:33,649
story of our guests. So tell us
a little bit about your origin

178
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,840
story and how that brought you
to where you are today.

179
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,715
David: Well, I was thinking
about this question. I love that

180
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:42,770
you start

181
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,275
with the origin story, and the
way you frame it as origin. I

182
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,780
can

183
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,030
remember using the Logo computer
language to make the little

184
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,030
turtle-

185
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,000
Dan: Yes. Yes.

186
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
David: -draw back and forth. I
don't remember a lot about

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,181
it, but I remember being really
excited when I discovered loops.

188
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:04,431
And I didn't even know they were
called loops but I could draw

189
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:09,816
flowers with not very much ...
code. So that was pretty

190
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,590
exciting. And then I went to,
you know, high school, and grew

191
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,364
up, and

192
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:19,775
lots of things happened. I went
to university and took a

193
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:22,775
computer science degree. I wound
up taking a computer science

194
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:26,736
degree. And that taught me a lot
of fundamentals about

195
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:30,905
computer architecture, saying,
like, hardware architecture.

196
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:33,456
There was a computer engineering
course in there too. And also

197
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:38,166
basics of data structures and
algorithms. So I feel like I got

198
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,775
a leg up on that before there
was any of the ... now all the

199
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:43,384
code

200
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,755
camps and everything, the
freeCodeCamps, and the Flatiron

201
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:47,120
School, and everything that I
hear about, all the resources

202
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,485
that are

203
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:51,020
available today. I didn't have
those back-- at that time, so--

204
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,555
but

205
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:55,100
I was fortunate enough to be
able to go to this university

206
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,614
program.

207
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,765
And I studied not only computer
science, but also it was kind of

208
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,595
a liberal arts-y program. And I
got exposed to all sorts of

209
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:03,425
other

210
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,591
things that were not technical
in the world. And I got very

211
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:08,961
distracted, and I didn't want
anything to do with technology,

212
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:10,790
and I wanted to go find
something more meaningful to do.

213
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,619
So I went

214
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,990
and I traveled. And that's when
I wound up in Indonesia with an

215
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,711
exchange program, with ...
Canadian Crossroads

216
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:22,341
International—a cultural
exchange program, designed to

217
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:25,805
expose people to different
cultures. And ... as I was

218
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:28,639
proceeding

219
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,363
with my life, I noticed a common
thread that ... I would

220
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:34,086
constantly notice

221
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:36,141
that people around me, that I
cared about— friends,

222
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:38,196
family—would

223
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:43,145
be stressed or unhappy with
technology. And they would be

224
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:44,750
frustrated, and they would start
to internalize it. Like, "Oh,

225
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,355
I'm

226
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,840
not good at this." Or, "I must
not be very smart because I

227
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,325
can't

228
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:51,215
figure this out." And I would
look at what they were

229
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:53,104
struggling

230
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:55,595
with, and I was frustrated. I
got frustrated because it wa- I

231
00:10:55,595 --> 00:10:58,085
knew

232
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,000
enough about technology to know
that it didn't have to

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,691
be that way. And that

234
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:06,980
what my friends and family were
struggling with was ... design

235
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,770
decisions that somebody had made
that hadn't really thought about

236
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,370
how they would land on a real
person. And that's really what

237
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,961
prompted me to get back into
technology. And from there,

238
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:21,051
I've done a number of technology
jobs-- technology related jobs,

239
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,511
web-- front-end-- now we would
call it front-end development.

240
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:25,941
At

241
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:29,750
the time I was starting to learn
about front-end engineering, and

242
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,895
that was back when ... I
remember before Firebug was

243
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:34,040
introduced,

244
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,591
like, back before Chrome dev
tools. And then Firebug was a

245
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:40,100
really big deal. jQuery and
Firebug changed the way we did

246
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:42,110
web development back then.

247
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:42,910
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, it did.

248
00:11:43,341 --> 00:11:45,995
David: And now-- well, from-
from there, I got tired of

249
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:48,649
front-end,

250
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,571
then I got interested in
backend. So I went and did

251
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:53,211
backend. I did a lot of C#. I
did years and years of C#.

252
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:57,426
In fact, I found recently a
commit somewhere in GitHub from

253
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,785
16 years ago that I did in C#.
I've been writing code

254
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:01,446
for a long time.

255
00:12:03,426 --> 00:12:06,846
And from there, I went to
various software developer jobs

256
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:10,655
and took some project management
training, got involved in the

257
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:17,436
local Winnipeg agile community,
and found my way into builds and

258
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:22,296
deploys. And that's what got me
into DevOps. And now, here I am.

259
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,000
Dan: That's awesome.

260
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,071
Bekah: That's-- I was gonna say
great, but--

261
00:12:28,191 --> 00:12:29,000
Dan: That- that-- oh, it's
great. It is great, also. It's

262
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,120
great and awesome.

263
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,000
No, that-- that's a cool ...
that's-- I- I love having

264
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,230
people on ... I mean, I

265
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,000
love having [chuckles] all of
our guest. It's- it's always

266
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,051
fun for- for me having

267
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,961
people on, who started, like,
when you started, when I-- you

268
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:43,223
know, back a long time ago. I-
I-- Logo, I hadn't thought about

269
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:44,480
for a

270
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:47,061
long time. I- I definitely did
Logo in, like, the computer lab

271
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:51,681
in- in middle school. What I
was-- I had a question for you.

272
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:54,350
What was it? Oh, it was ...
okay. So you mentioned, like,

273
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,441
red- like, learning fundamentals
and learning computer science

274
00:12:57,441 --> 00:12:59,345
stuff, sort of maybe a ... I
don't know what the-- hard

275
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,249
computer

276
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,000
science [chuckles] ... I dunno
what a good term is for

277
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,880
it. But, you know,

278
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,530
this-- the kind of stuff that--
at least back in the day you

279
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,180
learned

280
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:12,110
in computer science courses in
college, right, versus

281
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:16,025
today where there's so many
different, like, places to go.

282
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:19,025
So many different ways to learn,
so many different approaches to

283
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:22,446
learning, even. And I guess the
thought that I had was,

284
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:26,225
what do you think, like, can you
imagine trying to learn from

285
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,250
scratch now and would you want
to? If you were starting over

286
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,660
right now [chuckles], right? But
you have all the stuff

287
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,070
available. Would

288
00:13:34,071 --> 00:13:36,035
you rather go that fundamentals
level and learning stuff,

289
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:37,999
probably

290
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:39,668
in languages that you're never
going to use in, you know, in-

291
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:41,331
in

292
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:42,816
practical levels, but you're
getting all the fundamental

293
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:44,301
stuff?

294
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,000
Or would you, like, there's
bootstrap- bootstrap-- no.

295
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,400
Boot-camps [chuckles]. Sorry.

296
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,931
Bootcamps, a-a-and everything
like that, that will put you

297
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:56,870
more in a practical place to- to
get, you know, where- where

298
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,950
you're learning some
JavaScripts, and learning React,

299
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,030
and stuff like

300
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,400
that, even before you ... know
... maybe some of the more

301
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,770
esoteric

302
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,405
pieces of computer science, you
know? And so, this is not a

303
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:07,009
judge-

304
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,256
like, I'm not asking you to,
like, place judgment on

305
00:14:08,256 --> 00:14:09,291
anything but

306
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,371
just, like, from a personal-
personal standpoint. Like,

307
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:11,451
where- where-

308
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,995
where do you-- like, where would
you land? Like, where

309
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:14,210
would you

310
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,230
personally rather ... start, if
you could start- [chuckles]

311
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,370
if you could start from scratch,
you know, now?

312
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:21,995
David: This is a really good
question, Dan. And it's come

313
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,426
up a number of times in Virtual
Coffee because we have a number

314
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:26,390
of people who are career
changers or- or early career

315
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,354
people in

316
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:29,840
the-- in the community. And
they're constantly wondering,

317
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,325
"What

318
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:32,000
do I do next?" and "What do I
look?"

319
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

320
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
David: The way you phrased it
though, for me, if I were to

321
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,556
start now ... I- I-- one of the
things I

322
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:43,775
notice about the technical
landscape today—compared to

323
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:45,994
when

324
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:50,916
I started—is it seems to have
exploded in technologies, and

325
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:55,505
frameworks, and libraries, and
possibilities. And I think it

326
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,000
would-- I would lean towards
practical first.

327
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

328
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
David: Because I think that
would help me learn enough

329
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,801
about one thing to start to
work.

330
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:11,211
And really, once you get into--
once you cross that difficult

331
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:14,331
barrier of finding your first
job in technology, then you can

332
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,000
get paid to learn-

333
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Dan: Absolutely. Yeah.

334
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,780
David: -as you work. And- and
then you can ... I don't know,

335
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:26,105
maybe ... I think it would be
worthwhile to take some survey

336
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:30,035
course of the fundamentals, some
high level survey course so that

337
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:32,165
you introduce the-- or you--
you're introduced to the words

338
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,295
and

339
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:38,706
phrases, because I find that the
computer science degree helps me

340
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:42,066
in two ways. One, that having
those fundamentals often helps

341
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,605
me understand new frameworks.
Cuz I kinda understand how

342
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:47,990
computers work underneath, and
all of the languages and

343
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,375
frameworks.

344
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,255
So learning any particular
practical framework gets, I

345
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:55,115
think, easier with that
fundamental background.

346
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:56,436
Dan: Yeah.

347
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:58,000
David: But I don't think it's
required to learn how to work

348
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,735
in any of those

349
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:02,885
things. I just think that it
helps me. The other place I

350
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:06,186
notice is that it helps me in
searching for things when I go

351
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:10,686
to Google, sometimes. The terms
and the phrases, I think. I'm

352
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:14,586
drawing from that training back
then. So, that's where I think

353
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:16,235
maybe a survey course ...
without having to go deep in all

354
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:17,884
those

355
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:19,340
things, because you-- I only
remember the things that I use.

356
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,795
And-

357
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:21,365
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

358
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:21,682
David: -we joke-- I mean, we
work in- in DevOps where caching

359
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:21,999
is a

360
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:30,426
thing. You know, one of the- the
two hard problems in computer

361
00:16:30,426 --> 00:16:34,000
science [Bekah and Dan chuckle],
right? And we joke about,

362
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,975
"My memory only holds

363
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:37,970
so much," and, "I expire things
for my mental cache when I go

364
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,965
and-

365
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:40,000
Dan: [Chuckles] Yeah,
absolutely.

366
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,660
David: -learn something new."
You know, you ask me a question

367
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,354
about

368
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:44,630
something that I supposedly
studied, and, "I have a cache

369
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,905
miss,

370
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,000
and I have to go look it up."
[Dan laughs] But I do find

371
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,355
that things that I have

372
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:52,000
learned and then purged, often
come back easier-

373
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Dan: Yeah.

374
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Bekah: Mm.

375
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
David: -or more easily. So-

376
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Dan: Yeah.

377
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
David: -that's a long winded way
of to say-

378
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Dan: Yeah!

379
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
David: -I would start practical,
today, because there's so many

380
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,326
... widespread things. I think
it

381
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:04,476
would take a long time to go
from fundamentals to something

382
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,000
practical, today. But-

383
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

384
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,931
David: -I think if you start
today with something

385
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:10,013
practical, you could add- but,
maybe, just a quick survey of--

386
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:12,095
you don't

387
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:13,475
need to kn- understand all the
data structures and algorithms.

388
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:14,854
But,

389
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:19,925
like, if you can name three of
them cuz you know they exist,

390
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:22,536
then you can search up
implementations of them or

391
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:23,945
details about them when you need
them.

392
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:24,681
Dan: Yeah.

393
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:25,191
Bekah: Good idea.

394
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,010
Dan: Oh, I think that-- I love
that answer. I, you know-- and I

395
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:29,423
think I tend to agree with you.
I per- I mean, also personally,

396
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,830
I-

397
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:36,050
I ... got interested in computer
development stuff because of

398
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,225
the-- like Logo, you know,
seeing something happen right

399
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,769
away, you

400
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,000
know [chuckles]? Like, hitting
save, and then, like, looking at

401
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,050
it, and, you

402
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,985
know, whatever. And
so-sometimes-- or- or writing

403
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:45,920
code on a

404
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:47,975
chalkboard and stuff like that
is like ... was-- I drifted

405
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:50,029
away from

406
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,411
it in college because ... I was
computer science major to

407
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:55,926
start as well. And, you know,
it- it just got less and less-

408
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:57,441
[chuckles] less

409
00:17:57,441 --> 00:17:59,076
and less, like, fun, you know? I
dunno. But you're right. Like

410
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:00,711
the--

411
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,995
knowing the ... like, for
instance, the Big-O notation,

412
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:07,010
right?

413
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,000
Like, analyzing ho-how a--
ho-how long a function takes

414
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,851
to do a thing, you

415
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:13,760
know? I don't think anybody
that's writing React code for

416
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,050
their job needs to know the
names of all the different--

417
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,340
you know?

418
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,000
Or even ... [chuckles] like,
they don't need to know the--

419
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,651
even the phrase 'Big-O',

420
00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:23,663
right? But knowing that will
help you- will help you sort of

421
00:18:23,663 --> 00:18:25,671
think

422
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,681
through and go-- like- like,
having that in your brain would

423
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:29,691
...

424
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,850
in the background, and it's okay
if it's expired cache

425
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,680
[chuckles] but

426
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:34,835
you'll still, like, see
something and start, like-- it's

427
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:35,989
like code

428
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
smell, kind of, you know?

429
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
David: I know.

430
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,961
Dan: That-- it's just like a
weird phrase but,

431
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:40,760
like, a phrase that makes a lot
of sense to people who have been

432
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,401
doing it for a while i-is- is
you'll start to get, like, these

433
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,000
instincts or whatever-- these-
these-- like, i-it's okay if

434
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,881
you don't know the

435
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:48,278
exact phrase or I don't remember
the exact name of it-- some

436
00:18:48,278 --> 00:18:49,671
specific

437
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,000
[chuckles] algorithm or anything
like that, but ...

438
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,020
okay, I know just sort of

439
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,445
almost intuitively that this
thing is going to take, like,

440
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:56,870
way

441
00:18:56,871 --> 00:19:00,530
longer ... than it should. And I
probably can do it a different-

442
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,000
different way, you know? That-
that sort of thing.

443
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
David: Right.

444
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Dan: I think that's the sort of
thing that would hit on

445
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,211
your idea of the--

446
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:08,961
like, doing- doing a high level,
you know, survey

447
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:10,881
course, something like that.
You'll get exposed to some of

448
00:19:10,885 --> 00:19:14,151
that stuff, even if ... and you
don't need to know, like, the

449
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:15,080
down and dirty details, you
know?

450
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:20,645
David: Even if we take something
that is, like, computer sciencey

451
00:19:20,796 --> 00:19:23,898
heavy, like Big-O notation, it's
very-- almost ... theoretical or

452
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:27,000
a-

453
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,980
Dan: Right.

454
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,480
David: -an academic. Like, it's
a very academic way to approach

455
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,980
this-

456
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,310
Dan: Exactly.

457
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,000
David: -technology thing. Not a
very practical way. But,

458
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,560
knowing that-- like,

459
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,530
being able to, like-- knowing
that something called Big-O

460
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,760
notation exists, being able to
have one sentence about it will

461
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:49,701
help you identify when it might
be ... in, like, a part of the

462
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:52,941
problem you're dealing with, and
give you enough words to go, and

463
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,851
google the details of how it
intersects with the problem

464
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:59,691
you're with. And you don't need
to be able to explain it in

465
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:00,711
detail or--

466
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:01,836
Dan: Right.

467
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:02,000
David: Do you see what I mean?
So-

468
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Dan: Totally.

469
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,401
David: -just knowing that it's a
thing or

470
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:05,931
knowing that caching is a thing
without knowing how caching

471
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:07,461
works

472
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:13,000
or knowing that ... I don't
know. The- the one that came

473
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,941
to mind as you were

474
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:17,000
talking is that string
concatenation is expensive in

475
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,830
C# [Bekah and Dan chuckle],

476
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,290
for whatever reason. Because
strings are immutable in C#.

477
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,750
They're

478
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,145
treated as immutable objects. So
every time you're joining

479
00:20:25,145 --> 00:20:26,540
strings

480
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,385
together, you're allocating
extra memory and copying

481
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:30,230
everything

482
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:35,030
over. So it's a very expensive
operation. That detail of C#

483
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,335
would never have stuck for me if
I don't think-- if I didn't

484
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,640
know a

485
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:40,101
little bit of fundamentals about
how memory allocation works.

486
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,871
Dan: Yeah. Yeah.

487
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:44,845
Bekah: I think, too, once you
are working, you-- you're coding

488
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:47,394
more

489
00:20:47,395 --> 00:20:51,236
rather than you're learning.
Those concepts become easier to

490
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:53,095
understand because we- if you're
learning, they- they are

491
00:20:53,095 --> 00:20:54,954
kind of

492
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:59,185
theoretical, right? Because you
have no use to apply them. Or if

493
00:20:59,185 --> 00:21:02,486
you are building a project for a
bootcamp or something, it's a

494
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:05,188
tiny little project. So it
doesn't exactly correlate

495
00:21:05,188 --> 00:21:07,890
m-much-

496
00:21:07,951 --> 00:21:11,520
much of that stuff with what
you're doing. So when you have

497
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,065
that, like, practical
application and you're learning

498
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,610
that like,

499
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:17,190
"Oh, okay. I understand where
this would be applied or where I

500
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,739
would

501
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:21,843
need to reference this idea."
And, at least for me, it becomes

502
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:23,940
a

503
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:27,000
little bit easier once I can see
... all right. Th-this is

504
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,911
where we need to think about
this.

505
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:34,431
David: This- this goes to my
understanding of how we learn

506
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:36,215
as humans. Like, we learn better
when there's emotion involved,

507
00:21:36,215 --> 00:21:37,999
we

508
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,680
learn better when there's motion
involved, we learn better when

509
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,360
we

510
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:44,608
have real experience to hang
ideas off of. And that just

511
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:47,855
makes

512
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:51,846
intuitive sense to me. That also
is why I say go practical. And

513
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:55,536
learn just enough theory to have
language ... to know when you

514
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:56,586
need to go deeper.

515
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,000
Bekah: I am [chuckles]-- so,
like, writing down, I-- you

516
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,736
just gave me a new talk idea

517
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,605
and the title has to be, like,
motion and emotion. And it has

518
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:09,455
something to do with learning
because I think both of those

519
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:13,745
things are, you know, does tie
it to our memory. It does allow

520
00:22:13,806 --> 00:22:15,605
us to connect with it in a
different way. And I know that

521
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:17,404
there are

522
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:19,685
people out there, there were
people when I was learning that

523
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:23,306
would said, "We have to learn
how to think higher level,

524
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:24,970
and theoretically, and how to
apply that." And I don't-- I

525
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,634
mean,

526
00:22:26,726 --> 00:22:31,766
my background, I taught college
English for 10 years and so I- I

527
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:33,416
can think theoretically
[chuckles]. It's something that

528
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,066
I had to do, but

529
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:41,185
I don't think that we 'have' to
do that, you know? I- I think

530
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:44,306
that that's a little bit
gatekeepy.

531
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,100
David: Absolutely. And- and it
also presupposes that there's

532
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,690
only one

533
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:54,681
way to learn and only one way to
think. And- and that seems to be

534
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:59,090
an idea that was stronger years
ago, and now we know better, one

535
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,911
of those ideas. Now we recognize
that there's a whole spectrum of

536
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:06,020
how people think, and process
information, and learn, and

537
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,931
view, and interact with the
world, and experience the world.

538
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:11,646
Bekah: Yeah. And you have a- a
lot of experience with this,

539
00:23:11,646 --> 00:23:12,921
especially

540
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:16,461
at Virtual Coffee. For our
listeners who aren't in the

541
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:20,240
Slack, we have a co-working room
where anybody can join at any

542
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,235
time. And it's an open Zoom
room. And sometimes people are

543
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:24,230
there to

544
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,351
hang out, sometimes people have
questions, and they jump into

545
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:32,570
pair. And David i-is one of our
cur- our top co-working room

546
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,500
attendees, I think. And you've
helped a lot of different people

547
00:23:36,506 --> 00:23:39,945
in the co-working room. So,
first of all, thank you. And

548
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:41,400
second of all, you know, this
all ties into what we've been

549
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,855
talking

550
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:46,006
about. How do you kind of
approach people who come in and

551
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:48,030
have questions? Because there
are so many different ways of,

552
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,875
you

553
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:50,895
know, talking through things and
learning.

554
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:54,171
David: Oh my gosh. Well, thank
you. I love the co-working room.

555
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:57,411
It's one of my favorite parts of
co- of Virtual Coffee and this

556
00:23:57,411 --> 00:24:02,151
community that you've created. I
never know what's gonna

557
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:04,221
happen when I go in there. But I
always know it's gonna be

558
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:04,500
friendly.

559
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Bekah: [Chuckles] Yeah.

560
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,790
David: And friendly faces. And
in the middle of a pandemic,

561
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:09,338
certainly, when I was locked in
my room, it was a lifesaver to

562
00:24:09,338 --> 00:24:10,880
be

563
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:13,260
able to dial it-- like, walking
virtually into a room and- and

564
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,635
meet

565
00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:20,346
friendly people. And, one of my
favorite co-working room

566
00:24:20,346 --> 00:24:23,645
memories is I-- you know, often
you go in, and there's people

567
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:26,016
who are not sharing a screen,
and they're just talking. Or

568
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:30,276
sometimes I go in, and there's
people who are all on mute, and

569
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,768
just enjoying being together.
And other times, I- I- I logged

570
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,256
in once,

571
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:37,475
and Meg had her laptop on her
front porch, and she was

572
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,694
gardening. And I

573
00:24:39,701 --> 00:24:41,000
logged in another time [Dan
chuckles], and Aurelie

574
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,256
was making crepes [Bekah
chuckles] in

575
00:24:44,256 --> 00:24:46,235
her kitchen. It was lovely. So,
it blew open for me that this

576
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,214
was

577
00:24:48,215 --> 00:24:51,935
really a- a place where people
could connect, which is ... at

578
00:24:51,935 --> 00:24:57,846
the heart of this community. But
to focus back, you asked about

579
00:24:57,846 --> 00:25:01,273
how do I approach ... pairing or
working with people from lo- a

580
00:25:01,273 --> 00:25:04,700
lots of

581
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:05,840
different backgrounds and lots
of different technology? Well,

582
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,979
some

583
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,630
of it is cuz I've been doing
this for a long time, so I've

584
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,280
seen a

585
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,861
bunch of things. I-- some of it
is that I'm in a job where I'm

586
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:19,875
actively working in several
different languages. And I'm

587
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:23,925
in a job where I'm working to
support developers. So I-- for

588
00:25:23,925 --> 00:25:25,440
five years, that's really been
my role. And even, Bekah, the

589
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,955
other

590
00:25:26,955 --> 00:25:28,215
day you were talking about
DevRel. And I realized, some of

591
00:25:28,215 --> 00:25:29,475
what I've

592
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:31,470
been doing falls under that
bucket of really looking for

593
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,464
ways

594
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:38,355
to help people who are having
problems. And I find there are

595
00:25:38,355 --> 00:25:41,130
some common threads, like, a lot
of it is ... really slowing down

596
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,905
my

597
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:48,050
thought process to take the time
to meet somebody in their

598
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,215
thought process as best I can.
To really try to hear ... not

599
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:54,380
what I

600
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:56,360
think the problem is, but try to
hear what someone else thinks

601
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,339
the

602
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,395
problem is and try to look at it
from their point of view as

603
00:26:00,395 --> 00:26:02,450
best

604
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:07,101
I can. And try to look with them
at whatever they're looking at.

605
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:09,441
So I will often say, "If you're
having trouble, can you share an

606
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:12,951
error message? Or can we share a
screen and I can look at the

607
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:15,770
same thing you are?" Because
words becoming adequate for

608
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,589
talking

609
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,310
about technical things. English
words in particular are so

610
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,000
imprecise sometimes. That we can
say the same word and mean

611
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,270
different things. So I often
find it really useful to share

612
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,540
... a

613
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:34,313
screen, and pair program, and
look at the sa- look at the same

614
00:26:34,313 --> 00:26:36,080
thing at

615
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,155
the same time, or to share a
stack trace, or a, you know,

616
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:42,230
the--

617
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,705
an error message. That's really
useful. I think I've drifted

618
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:47,180
from

619
00:26:47,361 --> 00:26:48,351
the heart of your question
though.

620
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,151
Bekah: I mean, I think it's
great. I mean, you're really

621
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:52,296
taking a- a person-centered
approach to each person that

622
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:54,441
comes into

623
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:56,497
that room. And the idea of,
like, listening and

624
00:26:56,497 --> 00:26:58,549
understanding is

625
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,575
something that I- I think a lot
of people struggle wh- struggle

626
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:02,600
with.

627
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:04,026
Myself included. Because it's
like, "All right, let's just

628
00:27:04,026 --> 00:27:05,451
dive

629
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:10,339
into this," right? And get going
without, like, taking that time

630
00:27:10,401 --> 00:27:12,800
to understand what's happening
with the other person first.

631
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:20,810
David: I really think that's
important. At some point in

632
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,997
my growth and career, I
discovered the Agile Manifesto,

633
00:27:23,997 --> 00:27:27,184
and people

634
00:27:27,215 --> 00:27:30,185
have-- I've since read lots of
things, you know, positive and

635
00:27:30,185 --> 00:27:31,865
not so positive about the Agile
Manifesto. And I don't mean to

636
00:27:31,865 --> 00:27:33,545
go

637
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:38,346
down that rabbit hole, but the
first value statement really

638
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:40,238
stuck and resonated with me that
we value people and

639
00:27:40,238 --> 00:27:42,125
relationships

640
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:49,101
over processes and things. That
is kind of a radical idea. If

641
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:50,751
you-- if you take that and
nothing else, that we value

642
00:27:50,751 --> 00:27:52,401
people in

643
00:27:52,401 --> 00:27:56,270
relationships over attachment to
any particular way of doing

644
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,520
things, and you start there, and
you really look to meet the

645
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,770
other

646
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,351
people that you're working with,
no matter what their role is, no

647
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:06,471
matter what their background is,
and realize that we're all part

648
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:09,621
of a group, or a team, or a
community that's trying to

649
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:14,796
accomplish something together, I
think all of the other practices

650
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:17,031
around software development and
delivery can emerge. If you

651
00:28:17,031 --> 00:28:19,266
start

652
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:20,945
with who's at the table, then
you really make space for

653
00:28:20,945 --> 00:28:22,624
everybody

654
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:25,655
who's at the table. And that
could be a hard thing cuz we're

655
00:28:25,655 --> 00:28:27,846
not always used to doing that.
There is a lot of gatekeepy,

656
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:33,905
like, language and habits in
technology. I try to do my part

657
00:28:33,905 --> 00:28:35,346
to break that stuff down.

658
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:39,336
Bekah: Yeah, I think a lot of
times, too-- sometimes it's

659
00:28:39,336 --> 00:28:42,996
certainly intentional and other
times it's not, it's- it's just

660
00:28:43,115 --> 00:28:48,066
habits that have built up
personally, or through careers,

661
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:51,875
or with the teams that you have
worked on before. So, you know,

662
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:57,215
there's a- a need for constantly
evaluating ourselves and how we

663
00:28:57,665 --> 00:29:00,786
approach the people that we are
talking to or working with.

664
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,000
David: I noticed something else
too. That ... pairing

665
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
really well, takes time-- takes
me time.

666
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,871
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

667
00:29:11,871 --> 00:29:14,000
David: I have to really slow
down, and let go of any

668
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,651
pressure, and really be

669
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:19,461
present with another person. And
that takes time, and energy, and

670
00:29:19,461 --> 00:29:22,086
effort. And if I'm under a
deadline to deliver something,

671
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:24,711
it

672
00:29:24,711 --> 00:29:29,510
can be challenging to make that
time and that pressure. But I

673
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:35,556
think it is so worth it to ...
balance individual contribution,

674
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:39,756
and individual delivery, and
individual speed with all of the

675
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:43,266
rich benefits you get from
building community as you work.

676
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:45,905
And from building relationships,
and sharing knowledge, and

677
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:49,925
building experience, and
supporting everybody to grow in

678
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:55,145
confidence and skill. There's so
many benefits from actually

679
00:29:55,145 --> 00:29:55,955
working together.

680
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:58,671
Bekah: Absolutely. And next
month, our monthly

681
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,961
challenge—this

682
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:02,571
will be in June—is Month of
Feedback. And so we read

683
00:30:02,571 --> 00:30:05,181
"Radical

684
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:08,030
Candor". I-- we've mentioned it
so many times. It's been a

685
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,560
favorite of ours. But when
you're working with so many

686
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,090
different

687
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:15,320
people, you are providing a lot
of feedback and that can be hard

688
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,701
sometimes, right? Because that
feedback has to be critical. How

689
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,582
do you approach, you know,
giving honest feedback but

690
00:30:22,582 --> 00:30:25,434
still supporting

691
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:28,375
the person that you are
providing the feedback to.

692
00:30:29,855 --> 00:30:31,445
David: That's a great question.
I started reading "Radical

693
00:30:31,445 --> 00:30:33,035
Candor"

694
00:30:33,276 --> 00:30:35,166
with someone on my team because
you have talked about it so

695
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,056
much.

696
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:47,480
And it is the ... I struggle a
bit with the directness of

697
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,385
critical feedback. That's where
I found that book was really

698
00:30:49,385 --> 00:30:51,230
useful

699
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,411
in giving me some examples of
how to be direct without being

700
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:55,000
confrontational, right? And-

701
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

702
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,161
David: -to stay heart-centered,
to stay

703
00:30:58,161 --> 00:31:01,431
person-centered, and to really
have the other persons to be

704
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:04,550
committed to the other person. I
find I really practice the

705
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,665
idea--

706
00:31:07,756 --> 00:31:08,940
well, practice which means I'm
not always good at it, but I

707
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,124
work

708
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:13,830
at it. I practice the idea that
everybody is where they're at,

709
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,535
on

710
00:31:17,536 --> 00:31:20,655
their own personal journey. And
everybody is right where they're

711
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:23,283
supposed to be in the moment.
And exactly the people that show

712
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:25,905
up

713
00:31:25,905 --> 00:31:28,786
are the people who are supposed
to be there. And the people who

714
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,766
are on your team are the people
who are supposed to be there.

715
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:33,428
Like, really try to embrace, and
accept, and love what's

716
00:31:33,428 --> 00:31:36,090
happening.

717
00:31:36,451 --> 00:31:42,931
I think that's really important.
To be more practical though,

718
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:46,425
I find-- still, I'm noticing a
lot of self-doubt and

719
00:31:46,425 --> 00:31:49,499
self-criticism

720
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,921
that happens in technology. And
so one of the things that I

721
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:54,975
really try to do when I'm
pairing is be encouraging. Above

722
00:31:54,975 --> 00:31:57,029
all else,

723
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,227
to be supportive and
encouraging. Because the biggest

724
00:31:59,227 --> 00:32:01,424
thing that I

725
00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:03,855
believe will help people learn
is to grow that confidence. That

726
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,496
it's okay to make a mistake.
It's okay not to know something.

727
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:09,615
That's actually part of the job.
And the faster that you are

728
00:32:09,615 --> 00:32:13,726
honest and open about what you
don't know as well as what you

729
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:15,481
know, then the faster that
everybody can see how to help

730
00:32:15,481 --> 00:32:17,236
you,

731
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:19,636
and the faster you can learn.
And so I really just try to--

732
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:22,036
always

733
00:32:22,036 --> 00:32:24,136
try to be supportive, and
patient, and guide people

734
00:32:24,136 --> 00:32:26,236
towards what

735
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,576
seems to be the next step so
that they can build their

736
00:32:28,576 --> 00:32:31,365
understanding, and get stronger,
and bigger. Because that kind of

737
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:33,465
pairing, and feedback, and
support, it's not about me ...

738
00:32:33,465 --> 00:32:35,565
in that moment.

739
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:37,590
It's really about trying to work
with somebody and support them

740
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,614
to

741
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:43,215
take whatever the next step is
for them. And if I'm deciding

742
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:49,185
what it is, then ... that's not
right. What I do sometimes

743
00:32:49,185 --> 00:32:52,965
though, is I might point people
in a direction. Based on the

744
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:54,458
journey that I've walked, I
might say, "You know, have you

745
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:55,951
thought

746
00:32:55,951 --> 00:32:58,000
about this?" Or "Let's go look
at that," or "I'd like ..."

747
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,371
yeah. I do more

748
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:02,489
direct coaching sometimes with
people on my team at work where

749
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,395
I say, "I'd like you to learn
this," or "I'd like you to learn

750
00:33:04,395 --> 00:33:06,300
that."

751
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:09,316
You know, in that context, I
feel like there's a framework,

752
00:33:09,316 --> 00:33:11,671
and

753
00:33:11,675 --> 00:33:13,651
it's part of my role and
responsibility to be more

754
00:33:13,651 --> 00:33:18,211
directive. But I still try to
partner with people, always to

755
00:33:18,211 --> 00:33:22,111
say, "There's what you want to
learn and what you're interested

756
00:33:22,111 --> 00:33:25,171
in, and there's what I see as an
opportunity for you, and let's

757
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:30,030
bring those together and make
out a plan." It's in--

758
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:30,480
Bekah: Yeah, I love that.

759
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:31,230
David: Yeah?

760
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:33,346
Bekah: But-- I was just gonna
say, acknowledging the person

761
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:34,471
where

762
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:37,711
they're at on the journey is a
huge part of that. And- and what

763
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:42,121
your relationship is with that
person. Because, for sure, we

764
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:45,570
communicate differently with
people we've been working with

765
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,505
for a while, or somebody who's
new on the team, or someone

766
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:49,440
we're

767
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:53,250
meeting for the first time. You
know, all of these things play a

768
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,971
role into, I think, how we
provide feedback and what the

769
00:33:56,971 --> 00:34:00,375
expectations are ... of us, you
know? If I ... am resop-

770
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:03,779
responding to

771
00:34:03,786 --> 00:34:07,141
a student's paper, there's an
expectation of how I'll respond

772
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:08,611
to that paper, versus if
somebody says, "Hey, can you

773
00:34:08,611 --> 00:34:10,081
give me

774
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:13,561
feedback on my blog post?" It's
going to be a little bit

775
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:16,561
different. I'm going to provide
feedback either way, but the

776
00:34:16,561 --> 00:34:18,030
tone is going to change, for
sure.

777
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:22,445
David: But through it all, that
concept of people and

778
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:24,333
relationships first is really
important. Like-- and that's

779
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,221
what

780
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:28,276
I have enjoyed about—the part of
"Radical Candor" that I've

781
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:30,331
managed

782
00:34:30,331 --> 00:34:33,721
to read so far—is that it does
start with that people-centered

783
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:40,260
approach. And that ... valuing
the person that you're giving

784
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,710
feedback to you and valuing the
relationship for what it is, not

785
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,225
needing to make it something
that it isn't in whatever

786
00:34:45,225 --> 00:34:46,740
context, but

787
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:51,331
valuing it for what it is. And
valuing that the other person

788
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,735
involved is a human on a
journey, just like you're a

789
00:34:53,735 --> 00:34:55,170
human on a

790
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,480
journey. And, you know, there
was a time when I didn't know

791
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,790
what I

792
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:02,581
was doing and people were
gracious with me. So I tried

793
00:35:02,581 --> 00:35:06,391
to return that favor. Pay it
forward, in that sense.

794
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:10,125
Dan: Yeah. And I- I'd say
another- another ... another

795
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,689
piece of

796
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,501
this is, you know, when you talk
about meeting people where

797
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:18,210
they are and things like that,
it helps when you know them

798
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,919
[chuckles]

799
00:35:20,431 --> 00:35:24,300
already, right? I-it's easier to
have connections when you ...

800
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,000
well, I was gonna say when you
are connected. I don't know.

801
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,101
[Dan and Bekah chuckle] I

802
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:30,078
dunno. That sentence kind of
broke down in the middle there.

803
00:35:30,078 --> 00:35:31,050
But ...

804
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,681
I was thinking about two things
when- when- when you were

805
00:35:34,681 --> 00:35:37,000
talking. Fun thing, Bek- Bekah
and I worked to-together--

806
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,016
and I don't even know why I

807
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:41,056
brought this up, but [chuckles]
Bekah and I worked together. And

808
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,096
it took

809
00:35:43,096 --> 00:35:44,326
us-- I dunno. How long do you
think it took us before-- I

810
00:35:44,326 --> 00:35:45,556
mean,

811
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:47,686
at least a year or something
before we were really, like--

812
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:50,000
Bekah: I feel like right before
the pandemic hit-

813
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Dan: [Chuckles] Oh, yeah. Right.
Yeah.

814
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Bekah: -we were, like, eight
months in, and we-- like, we

815
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,940
finally hit that stride. And

816
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,000
then- and then [chuckles] ...
and kinda messed up.

817
00:35:55,666 --> 00:36:00,900
Dan: Yeah. And- and some of- and
some of that is, like ... some

818
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,195
of it is me-- you know, so Bekah
had just started in- in, like,

819
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:05,490
in dev and

820
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,101
had just kind of gotten outta
bootcamp and stuff. And so some

821
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:10,621
of it was me, like, learning how
to do that better, you know?

822
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:13,681
Learning to do all the stuff
that David's just talking about.

823
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:18,181
And some of it I think is- is
just that connection over time,

824
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:21,210
you know, kind of just grows and
grows stronger. And that's

825
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,235
another thing I appreciate about
Virtual Coffee. And- and I- I

826
00:36:23,235 --> 00:36:25,260
think

827
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,590
it helps is-- when you know
people, you know, it's- it's-

828
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:31,950
it's a little bit ... easier to
do this [chuckles], I guess. And

829
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:35,279
to get

830
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,540
practice at it when you know a
person. And so- so you don't

831
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,800
have

832
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,780
to, maybe, necessarily-- like,
I- I-- when I pair with

833
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,760
somebody, I've

834
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,160
paired with people, you know,
kind of cold, right? So, people

835
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,530
I don't know, and for the first
time, and there's always a

836
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,681
bit of, like, level setting, you
know? And I-- and I- I try to be

837
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:51,016
very-- I mean, I- I wanna be
very careful about it. And I,

838
00:36:51,016 --> 00:36:52,351
you know,

839
00:36:52,356 --> 00:36:54,933
it's ... like, you- you don't
wanna assume that they-- that a

840
00:36:54,933 --> 00:36:57,510
person knows

841
00:36:57,661 --> 00:36:58,651
things that they don't know, you
don't wanna assume that they

842
00:36:58,651 --> 00:36:59,641
don't

843
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:01,365
know anything either, right? And
so, it's that, like-- it's

844
00:37:01,365 --> 00:37:03,089
that--

845
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,000
I- I just-- I called it level
setting cuz I'm, like-- a-and

846
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,931
I've-- now I've just

847
00:37:06,936 --> 00:37:08,988
started explicit do-doing it.
Like, I- I- I wanna be very,

848
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:11,040
like, clear

849
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,471
that I'm-- you know, I- I just
wanna figure out where we are,

850
00:37:13,476 --> 00:37:16,590
you know, where you are, where-
where, like, what level I can

851
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,090
talk at, you know? And it's--
there's no judgment at, you

852
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,590
know?

853
00:37:19,621 --> 00:37:22,155
It's just what-- it's just
somebody who's just learning for

854
00:37:22,155 --> 00:37:24,689
the first

855
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,641
time is gonna have different
questions and different thought

856
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:28,786
processes than somebody who
maybe is a Ruby expert but is

857
00:37:28,786 --> 00:37:30,931
just

858
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:31,966
starting a JavaScript. That
person is going to have

859
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:33,001
completely

860
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:37,170
different questions, you know?
You know-- and- and so, it's

861
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,320
always ... I don't know. It's
always kind of interesting to--

862
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,621
when you're connecting with
different people. So when you

863
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:45,046
have a-- when you're at work and
you're in a team, kind of,

864
00:37:45,046 --> 00:37:46,471
you build

865
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:49,703
a rapport over- over time,
right? And when you are in a lot

866
00:37:49,703 --> 00:37:52,935
of

867
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:54,555
random internet communities, you
can still be valuable and you

868
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:56,174
can

869
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:58,335
still have valuable connections
with people you don't know,

870
00:37:58,755 --> 00:37:59,295
for sure. But--

871
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:03,090
David: Well, this overlaps, I
think, with- with you were

872
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:06,885
talking about, Bekah, in that
DevRel session you gave the

873
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,315
other day, too. That there's a
part of community building and a

874
00:38:09,315 --> 00:38:12,765
part of developer relations that
is ... going out and reaching

875
00:38:12,765 --> 00:38:16,215
out to

876
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:19,065
people that are not yet a part
of the community. And trying to

877
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:24,465
create an opening ... connection
with somebody that you don't

878
00:38:24,465 --> 00:38:28,876
know. Dan, as you were talking,
I'm reminded that one of

879
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:32,295
the things that constantly
surprises me still, years later,

880
00:38:32,565 --> 00:38:34,305
when I-- about software
development, is how long it

881
00:38:34,305 --> 00:38:36,045
takes to get

882
00:38:36,045 --> 00:38:38,370
started with new people.
Especially with new people. When

883
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,695
I-

884
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:40,695
Dan: Mm-hmm.

885
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:42,570
David: -sit down to pair with a
new person, say, a new person

886
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,445
joins my

887
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:46,965
team or I'm in the co-working
room for the first time with

888
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:49,987
somebody new, it's not
unreasonable to take one to

889
00:38:49,987 --> 00:38:53,009
three

890
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:58,530
hours to just set out your
machines to work in this-- a

891
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:02,971
compatible way, and set up your
language like you were talking

892
00:39:02,971 --> 00:39:05,911
about, to figure out what level
of detail and abstraction to

893
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:08,851
speak at.

894
00:39:08,851 --> 00:39:09,675
Dan: Right, right.

895
00:39:09,675 --> 00:39:11,670
David: And hear each other, and
to develop a common

896
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,665
understanding of

897
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:15,571
the problem, and to work through
build and compile issues in a

898
00:39:15,571 --> 00:39:17,476
new

899
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:19,743
environment. Like, all these
things that are not typing, that

900
00:39:19,743 --> 00:39:22,005
are not-

901
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:24,000
Dan: [Chuckles] Yes. Yes.

902
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:24,030
David: -reading and writing
code, become really, really

903
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,055
important

904
00:39:26,356 --> 00:39:31,155
and take real time when you care
about the relationships of the

905
00:39:31,155 --> 00:39:34,905
people you're working with. And
I'm constantly surprised by, you

906
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:40,936
know, how little I get da- how
little progress we make in the

907
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:45,585
code when I sit down to pair
with people at work, say, for

908
00:39:45,585 --> 00:39:46,000
the first time.

909
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Dan: Absolutely.

910
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,835
David: And how much time it
takes to build that initial

911
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:53,925
rapport, and common ground, and
common language, and common

912
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:55,605
environment. And the reason I
keep talking about it here is

913
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:57,285
cuz

914
00:39:57,315 --> 00:39:58,770
I really want to normalize it
for anybody who's listening. If

915
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,225
you

916
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,118
try pair programming, and you
sit down with another human,

917
00:40:02,118 --> 00:40:04,005
expect

918
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:06,826
it to be awkward at first.

919
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:07,951
Dan: Yeah.

920
00:40:08,326 --> 00:40:09,526
David: I-it will be. And that's
okay. That doesn't mean you're

921
00:40:09,526 --> 00:40:10,726
doing it

922
00:40:10,726 --> 00:40:12,000
wrong. And that doesn't mean
you're failing. It-- that's

923
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,274
part--

924
00:40:13,306 --> 00:40:16,666
that means it's working. That's
part of figuring out how to work

925
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:19,936
together with another human. And
it does-- it's like any other

926
00:40:19,936 --> 00:40:24,195
muscle or skill. It does get
easier over time. Dan, you spoke

927
00:40:24,201 --> 00:40:27,525
about, you know, you-- you're
working to get better at how to

928
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:31,545
ask those questions more
directly. How to figure out and

929
00:40:31,545 --> 00:40:33,720
navigate that awkwardness
faster. I- I ha- I feel like I

930
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,895
can navigate

931
00:40:35,896 --> 00:40:36,766
it faster now than--

932
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:38,000
Dan: Yes, absolutely.

933
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,200
Bekah: I think--

934
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,766
Dan: Yeah. You're saying?

935
00:40:39,766 --> 00:40:43,396
Bekah: You know, coming from the
other perspective, like, it's-

936
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:47,235
it's a two way conversation,
right? And so, when you're first

937
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,686
starting out, it can be really
hard to ask those questions. And

938
00:40:50,686 --> 00:40:51,916
if there's anything, I feel like
I've learned over the last

939
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,146
couple

940
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:56,715
of years, it's ask those
questions whether or not you

941
00:40:56,715 --> 00:41:01,635
think it's gonna make you sound
ridiculous or incapable. You're

942
00:41:01,635 --> 00:41:06,226
going to learn and grow faster
that way. And so, you know,

943
00:41:06,556 --> 00:41:10,755
having those conversations and
being open about where you are

944
00:41:10,755 --> 00:41:15,195
too, if you're on the other side
of that- that pairing screen is

945
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:19,936
essential. Do you have any tips
for people who are on that side

946
00:41:19,965 --> 00:41:21,705
of the screen? So opposite of
you, David, about, like, how-

947
00:41:21,705 --> 00:41:23,445
how do you

948
00:41:23,445 --> 00:41:27,496
ask those questions or what can
help make this a successful

949
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:31,005
session by having these-- this
conversation?

950
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:33,920
David: Well, I like everything
you just said, Bekah. All of

951
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,239
that

952
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,900
is really important. Asking
questions. The faster you ask a

953
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,900
question, the faster you'll find
out if the person that you're

954
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:47,251
pairing with i-is, you know, how
they're gonna react to you? And

955
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:49,471
the faster you'll find out if
that's gonna work for you, and

956
00:41:49,471 --> 00:41:52,380
it's gonna be a pairing session
that you wanna stick with. Or if

957
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,541
the person's not gonna treat you
well, not in a place where they

958
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:57,359
have the skills to treat you
well, and- and you can get out

959
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,100
of there, right? The faster--
it's all about feedback and

960
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,840
shortening

961
00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:02,343
feedback loops. So that's one
part of it. It's the faster you

962
00:42:02,343 --> 00:42:03,840
can

963
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,310
ask questions, the faster you
can say what you know, the

964
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,780
faster

965
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,265
you can say what you don't know
without-- you know, with as

966
00:42:08,265 --> 00:42:09,750
little

967
00:42:09,751 --> 00:42:11,618
emotion or ... I mean, we're all
emotional people. I don't mean

968
00:42:11,618 --> 00:42:13,485
to

969
00:42:13,485 --> 00:42:17,175
say you have to be abstract. But
there's that thing that we do

970
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:20,000
sometimes ... I've done it when
I was learning Indonesian.

971
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,215
I did it. When I was

972
00:42:22,215 --> 00:42:26,476
almost embarrassed to share what
I knew, embarrassed to try to

973
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:29,775
speak in a new language. And I
think it's very similar with

974
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:32,326
technology. If you're not
familiar with language or

975
00:42:32,326 --> 00:42:37,456
concepts, it can feel
embarrassing to try. But please

976
00:42:37,456 --> 00:42:41,235
do. The faster you try and the-
the faster you take risks, the

977
00:42:41,235 --> 00:42:44,085
faster you'll find out who will
support you in those risks and-

978
00:42:44,235 --> 00:42:46,096
and how fast you can grow.

979
00:42:46,936 --> 00:42:47,000
Dan: Yeah.

980
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Bekah: That's great.

981
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,146
Dan: And I just wanted to add,
that- that advice applies not

982
00:42:50,146 --> 00:42:53,235
just to beginners too. It's-- it
can be embarrassing for me.

983
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:55,576
I mean, I can feel that
embarrassment, you know, trying

984
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:59,626
new things, and- and- and some
hesitancy, and things like

985
00:42:59,626 --> 00:43:01,000
that [chuckles]. So, it's great
advice. I just did--

986
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,865
and it applies to everybody,

987
00:43:02,865 --> 00:43:04,755
and we all go through it. You
know what I mean? So--

988
00:43:05,146 --> 00:43:06,226
David: And we go-- that's
important that you bring up,

989
00:43:06,226 --> 00:43:07,306
Dan.

990
00:43:07,306 --> 00:43:09,944
Cuz we go through it, not just
once. It's not just something

991
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:10,500
you go through-

992
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,000
Dan: Right, right.

993
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,460
David: -as you're entering your
technology career. And

994
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,880
that's why it's so important to
get practiced at it. Because you

995
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,780
will experience that throughout
your career. Cuz we're always

996
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,840
learning and technologies are
always frame- changing. New

997
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,311
frameworks, new libraries. You
mentioned earlier, a JavaScript

998
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:34,380
or a Java developer who was
learning Ruby, I think? And ...

999
00:43:35,085 --> 00:43:36,630
when I first started learning
Go-- I've programmed C# for

1000
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,175
years,

1001
00:43:38,175 --> 00:43:39,465
when I first started learning
Go, I bang my head against

1002
00:43:39,465 --> 00:43:40,755
things. It felt

1003
00:43:40,755 --> 00:43:45,976
awkward, didn't know how to ask
questions. I have been known

1004
00:43:45,976 --> 00:43:48,676
to rant about TypeScript [Bekah
chuckles] and Webpack in Virtual

1005
00:43:48,676 --> 00:43:51,376
Coffee

1006
00:43:51,376 --> 00:43:57,916
threads. And I kind of laugh as
I do that because that's me,

1007
00:43:57,916 --> 00:44:02,925
where I could-- I could write
C#, cold, probably in-- from

1008
00:44:02,925 --> 00:44:04,380
memory, from just having-- like,
I know the syntax so well

1009
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,835
cuz I've

1010
00:44:05,835 --> 00:44:08,266
done it so long. And I can't,
for the life of me, figure out

1011
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:09,766
Webpack. Or--

1012
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:13,351
and I struggle with TypeScript
bindings. And I was

1013
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:16,231
working with JavaScript back
before it was popular. So, you--

1014
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:19,095
Dan: Nobody understands Webpack,
David. [David and Dan laugh]

1015
00:44:19,095 --> 00:44:21,569
It's okay.

1016
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,325
David: It's good to have
community in that [Bekah

1017
00:44:23,325 --> 00:44:25,080
chuckles]. But yeah,

1018
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:26,732
every- every time you go to--
every time I've gone to a new

1019
00:44:26,732 --> 00:44:28,379
project,

1020
00:44:28,411 --> 00:44:31,351
or gone to a new company, or
changed jobs, there's that

1021
00:44:31,351 --> 00:44:32,670
learning curve again. Every time
I pair with somebody new,

1022
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,989
there's

1023
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,878
that learning curve. I was just
banging my head this past

1024
00:44:36,878 --> 00:44:39,766
weekend

1025
00:44:39,766 --> 00:44:43,635
against one of the old advent of
code problems and feeling like I

1026
00:44:43,635 --> 00:44:45,795
don't know what I'm doing, you
know? And I've been doing this a

1027
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,826
long time. So by getting
comfortable with that feeling

1028
00:44:48,826 --> 00:44:49,335
is really valuable.

1029
00:44:49,695 --> 00:44:49,905
Dan: Yeah.

1030
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:52,036
David: It's good- good work to
practice.

1031
00:44:53,385 --> 00:44:55,726
Dan: Agreed. Yeah. I'm- I'm
digging into TypeScript for

1032
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,105
really the first time over the
last month or two, too. So we

1033
00:44:57,105 --> 00:44:58,484
have--

1034
00:44:58,815 --> 00:45:02,055
TypeScript Tuesdays is my little
plug. [Laughs] Every Tuesday at

1035
00:45:02,056 --> 00:45:05,925
two PM Eastern with Kirk, who
is-- who's like a, you know--

1036
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:09,525
he's- he's done a lot of-- he-
he is a fan of, you know,

1037
00:45:09,525 --> 00:45:13,981
strongly type things. And I have
been ... long time not fan of

1038
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:16,000
that, so [laughs] ... but some
of it-- some of it is

1039
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,940
avoiding-- it is- is, you

1040
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:20,190
know, you open-- I open up--
I've been writing JavaScript for

1041
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,831
20 years. I open up a TypeScript
file, and I'm like, "This looks

1042
00:45:22,831 --> 00:45:24,000
like ... nonsense to me."

1043
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
David: A-ha. Thank you [laughs]
[clap hands].

1044
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,701
Dan: I can't understand it and I
close it. But

1045
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:29,000
I-- and I-- and I, like, I'm--
in-instead of like

1046
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,721
digging in or asking

1047
00:45:30,721 --> 00:45:33,360
questions and making myself, you
know, possibly look like I don't

1048
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,000
know everything, I close it, and
run away, and say,

1049
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,351
"TypeScript is dumb [Bekah
chuckles]. It-- it's

1050
00:45:37,356 --> 00:45:39,000
dumb [chuckles]," you know?
[David laughs] That's what

1051
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,010
I've done for the last 10 years
or

1052
00:45:41,016 --> 00:45:44,010
whatever. And so, finally I was
like, "Okay. Let's- let's- let's

1053
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,271
dig in." And so-- you know what
I mean? Yeah.

1054
00:45:45,496 --> 00:45:48,735
David: Okay. And full on every
time I've ranted about Webpack

1055
00:45:48,735 --> 00:45:52,126
or TypeScript, I'm aware that
it's because I haven't spent

1056
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:52,800
the time to learn it.

1057
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Dan: [All laugh] Yeah.

1058
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,272
David: [Laughs] Sometimes it's
fun to put on that grumpy old

1059
00:45:57,272 --> 00:45:58,544
man hat-

1060
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,545
Dan: Oh, absolutely.

1061
00:45:58,545 --> 00:45:59,805
David: -and say, "Yeah, I've
been programming JavaScript

1062
00:45:59,805 --> 00:46:01,065
since

1063
00:46:01,065 --> 00:46:03,000
before there were types. I
don't-- who needs types?"

1064
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,246
[Bekah chuckles] Like, "Write
your

1065
00:46:04,246 --> 00:46:09,000
angle brackets. I-- whatever."
[David and Dan laugh] No.

1066
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,106
It's-- but none of that one
does, like--

1067
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,686
really, there's an element of
humility that's important to

1068
00:46:13,686 --> 00:46:15,351
practice in this industry.
Because there's so much lack of

1069
00:46:15,351 --> 00:46:17,016
humility

1070
00:46:17,315 --> 00:46:20,945
abounds, arrogance abounds,
gatekeeping abounds. And

1071
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:24,065
anything we can do to be humble
with each other and really

1072
00:46:24,065 --> 00:46:28,445
support each other ... to work
together and to grow together

1073
00:46:28,445 --> 00:46:30,396
is a- a net positive. That's
[unintelligible].

1074
00:46:30,646 --> 00:46:34,306
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. And- and I
think a lot of that arrogance,

1075
00:46:34,786 --> 00:46:38,985
and gatekeeping, and some--
i-i-is- is because-- the root

1076
00:46:38,985 --> 00:46:40,000
cause of it is insecurity,
right?

1077
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

1078
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,530
Dan: And- and not wanting to--
not wanting to look ... dumber,

1079
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,985
look like you don't know things
[chuckles]. And I've- I've

1080
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:46,440
fallen in

1081
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,030
that trap. I- I try, like-- I
don't- I don't know. Maybe I- I

1082
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,620
haven't-

1083
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,170
haven't noticed. But I- I don't
usually-- for me it doesn't

1084
00:46:52,231 --> 00:46:55,021
manifest as gatekeeping,
hopefully, or things like

1085
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,476
that. It just manifests me
avoiding topics [chuckles]. I

1086
00:46:56,476 --> 00:46:57,931
don't wanna-- I

1087
00:46:57,931 --> 00:46:59,115
don't wanna, you know, learn, or
don't know, or whatever, you

1088
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:00,299
know?

1089
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:06,811
And that practicing humility and
practicing ... admitting or-

1090
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:10,666
or, you know, being public about
not knowing things is- is been

1091
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:12,556
something I've been personally
working on for the last couple

1092
00:47:12,556 --> 00:47:15,000
years. And- and it's-- and it
feels good once you--

1093
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,585
[chuckles] once you turn the

1094
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:18,135
corner. Once you realize it
doesn't actually, like-

1095
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:18,195
David: No.

1096
00:47:18,195 --> 00:47:21,000
Dan: -you know, hurt to not know
literally everything

1097
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,005
in the world [laughs].

1098
00:47:22,365 --> 00:47:23,835
Bekah: What I will say, too, one
of the greatest learning

1099
00:47:23,835 --> 00:47:25,305
experiences

1100
00:47:25,306 --> 00:47:29,806
I've had over the past couple
years is watching conversations

1101
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:34,096
in Slack between people who I
see as experts in the field

1102
00:47:34,246 --> 00:47:37,335
asking each other questions,
right? Like, "Oh, okay. This is

1103
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,766
how you ask that question." Or,
you know, "They don't know

1104
00:47:39,766 --> 00:47:43,876
everything." And that does help
provide more of an awareness

1105
00:47:43,965 --> 00:47:45,615
that I can ask those questions
too.

1106
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,345
David: Hmm. That reminds me I
wanna go back to that-- a part

1107
00:47:48,345 --> 00:47:49,560
of the

1108
00:47:49,561 --> 00:47:51,900
question that you asked, Bekah,
that we didn't really address.

1109
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,080
Which is what makes a good
question. And ...

1110
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,260
[clears throat] if you think

1111
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,810
about everything we've been
talking about, the faster you

1112
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,360
can

1113
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,705
help somebody ... acclimatize to
how to speak to you, the faster

1114
00:48:06,705 --> 00:48:10,050
you'll

1115
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:13,141
get your question answered. And
so how do you do that? You learn

1116
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:16,860
to add more detail in the
question, which is like your

1117
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,010
initial offering to somebody.
When you're asking somebody for

1118
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,911
help, the more you can put into
that question to say, "I thought

1119
00:48:23,911 --> 00:48:26,296
about this." "I tried this."
"Here's the command I used."

1120
00:48:26,296 --> 00:48:28,681
"Here's

1121
00:48:28,681 --> 00:48:33,181
the output that I got." Like,
the more language that you use,

1122
00:48:33,181 --> 00:48:35,550
often it's a better question.
Because you're giving somebody

1123
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,335
more context and the ability to
understand better where you're

1124
00:48:37,335 --> 00:48:39,120
at

1125
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:43,561
and what you're really dealing
with. I- I get questions in my

1126
00:48:43,561 --> 00:48:45,031
job. Sometimes I get questions
like, "The integration

1127
00:48:45,031 --> 00:48:46,501
environment

1128
00:48:46,505 --> 00:48:48,000
is down." [Bekah and Dan
chuckle] And I look at that,

1129
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,447
and I say, "Okay, thank you
[chuckles]." [Coughs] The

1130
00:48:52,447 --> 00:48:59,257
integration environment where I
work has probably, like, 75

1131
00:48:59,257 --> 00:49:01,116
microservices or more, across--
like, grouped into several

1132
00:49:01,116 --> 00:49:02,975
different

1133
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:04,491
applications. And so,
integration is down could mean

1134
00:49:04,491 --> 00:49:06,006
any number of

1135
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:08,346
things. Are-- is that a-- is--
are you getting an- an

1136
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:10,685
authentication

1137
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:14,347
error? Is that a, you know-- do
you have an HTTP status code you

1138
00:49:14,347 --> 00:49:17,496
can share? Do you have-- can you
tell me what application was

1139
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:20,586
trying to call what application?
Can you tell me what was the

1140
00:49:20,586 --> 00:49:22,339
actual response you got? What
was compared to the expected

1141
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:24,092
response

1142
00:49:24,092 --> 00:49:26,581
you got? Can you tell me what
language you're working in? Can

1143
00:49:26,581 --> 00:49:29,222
you tell me what version of the
language you're working in? Can

1144
00:49:29,222 --> 00:49:31,831
you tell me what libraries and
tools you're using that might be

1145
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:35,431
relevant? You know, all of that
detail is helpful. Partly cuz it

1146
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:39,092
teaches the people who might
answer your question what

1147
00:49:39,097 --> 00:49:41,942
language they can use with you
because you're exposing what

1148
00:49:41,942 --> 00:49:46,882
language you know. And it's also
giving people more ... detail to

1149
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:48,366
hang onto. There are problems
that I can solve. And I have

1150
00:49:48,366 --> 00:49:49,850
done

1151
00:49:49,851 --> 00:49:52,911
in our Virtual Coffee's Slack,
where just seeing the error

1152
00:49:52,911 --> 00:49:55,311
message reminds me of something
I've already seen. And I can

1153
00:49:55,311 --> 00:49:58,041
point somebody without even
needing to be at a computer or

1154
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:01,461
look at their screen. I can at
least offer a few keywords or

1155
00:50:01,461 --> 00:50:04,132
say, "Go try this," or, "go try
that," you know? And sometimes

1156
00:50:04,132 --> 00:50:06,000
that's enough to unblock
somebody. But if-

1157
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Dan: Absolutely.

1158
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
David: -if the person who asked
the question didn't

1159
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,981
include the actual error
message, then

1160
00:50:12,987 --> 00:50:15,264
I've seen also where that can
turn into a thread of 55

1161
00:50:15,264 --> 00:50:17,541
messages long

1162
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:20,000
with people talking past each
other. So-

1163
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Bekah: Yeah.

1164
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
David: -as somebody who wants to
ask a question, I don't

1165
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,461
expect you to have solved the
problem.

1166
00:50:25,641 --> 00:50:28,461
It's not this idea that, you
know, "Don't come to me with

1167
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:30,742
problems. Only come to me with
solutions." Like, it's not that

1168
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:36,202
business. Not at all. But it's
... share with me what you've

1169
00:50:36,202 --> 00:50:37,000
already thought about.

1170
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Dan: Totally.

1171
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,407
David: And share with me as much
detail as you can about

1172
00:50:41,407 --> 00:50:44,226
what you know and what you don't
know. About the problem that

1173
00:50:44,226 --> 00:50:49,777
you're asking. Cuz that will
help me learn ... where you're

1174
00:50:49,777 --> 00:50:52,146
struggling and how to speak to
you about it.

1175
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,597
Bekah: Yeah. Thank you so much
for being here with us today,

1176
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:58,626
David. This was just fantastic.
I feel like we could have done

1177
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,366
three hours worth of this
conversation. But I do

1178
00:51:00,366 --> 00:51:01,926
appreciate

1179
00:51:01,927 --> 00:51:05,586
your time and thanks for helping
us to kick off our new

1180
00:51:05,586 --> 00:51:05,786
season.

1181
00:51:06,501 --> 00:51:07,461
David: Oh, my pleasure.

1182
00:51:08,092 --> 00:51:13,494
Dan: Yeah. Thank you, David.
