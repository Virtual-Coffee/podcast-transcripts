13
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:44,173
Bekah: Yep.

14
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:49,963
Dan: Um,well,glad to hear it.Uh,
yeah.Um,today we are speaking

15
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:53,802
with Arthur Doler,who has,uh,
been a Virtual Coffee member for

16
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:58,093
a while and he's been a software
engineer for a long time.Uh,

17
00:00:58,302 --> 00:01:01,482
well,let's see,his bio says19
years,so that's,that's a pretty

18
00:01:01,482 --> 00:01:04,483
long time.Um,and he's worked on a
bunch of different things over

19
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:08,923
his career and he's also gotten
into,um,mental health advocacy,

20
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:11,423
during his career.So,uh,
especially related to tech stuff,

21
00:01:11,423 --> 00:01:15,703
I think,um,although maybe not
exclusively tech related mental

22
00:01:15,703 --> 00:01:18,793
health stuff,but,um,he's done a
lot of blog posts and talks about

23
00:01:18,793 --> 00:01:21,643
mental health,uh,over the last
few years.It's,it's been really

24
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:23,683
cool.It's one of the things that
caught my eye about Arthur when

25
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:28,783
he joined the community,uh,
joined Virtual Coffee was his

26
00:01:28,783 --> 00:01:31,513
work and his thoughts in that
area.Uh,and we talked about a

27
00:01:31,513 --> 00:01:32,862
lot,uh,in it was.

28
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:37,093
Bekah: Yeah,I actually got the
chance to meet Arthur last year

29
00:01:37,753 --> 00:01:40,483
to one of his talks that we've
included in the show notes about

30
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:44,082
burnout.And one of the things
that I love about Arthur and

31
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:47,022
talking to him is I will always
learn something in those

32
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:51,013
conversations.He'll teach me
something about mental health and

33
00:01:51,373 --> 00:01:55,183
I,it's from a perspective that I
might not have known had I not

34
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:58,783
had that conversation or heard
what he said,and I know.Now that

35
00:01:58,783 --> 00:02:02,772
as I'm kind of transitioning and
looking for a new job,I've taken

36
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:06,462
a lot of what he's taught me in
that talk about burnout and kind

37
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:09,252
of applied it to the process that
I'm going through right now.And

38
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:12,733
so it,it's great to be able to
talk a little bit about that,

39
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:16,872
but,um,about a lot of different
aspects of mental health in this

40
00:02:16,877 --> 00:02:17,413
episode today.

41
00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:21,217
Dan: Yeah,totally.And we,we
talked a lot about,um,we also got

42
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:27,668
into the idea of the,the human
sort of network that is a

43
00:02:27,673 --> 00:02:31,057
company,right?And,and how a,a
company or a,a team or whatever

44
00:02:31,057 --> 00:02:34,138
isn't just.Some sort of plug and
play thing.And it's not just a

45
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:36,717
machine,right?It's a bunch of
people and they all work

46
00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:40,108
differently.Managers work
differently,uh,contributors work

47
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:44,008
differently,and it all has to
work together somehow.Right.And,

48
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:47,608
um,so we,we talked a lot about
some,some of that,uh,the mental

49
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:52,187
health,uh,vis-a-vis management
and,and how it's sometimes hard

50
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:54,467
to forget when you're having an
issue with somebody that,that

51
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:57,138
they have all these feelings and,
and motivations and,uh,

52
00:02:57,138 --> 00:03:01,277
everything too.And usually it's
very easy to like villainize

53
00:03:01,638 --> 00:03:05,568
somebody,who you're having issues
with.And,um,how that's not always

54
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:08,538
the most helpful,helpful thing in
the world.although it can feel

55
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:10,848
good,you know,in the moment when
you're doing some bending,but,

56
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:14,358
uh,to actually move forward,
right?There's,there's like needs

57
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:17,457
that connection and the empathy
between,between two.as opposed to

58
00:03:17,457 --> 00:03:20,937
just manager and reportee,you
know?Um,so

59
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:25,877
Bekah: Yeah.Yeah.That of
motivation is.Arthur had some new

60
00:03:25,877 --> 00:03:29,418
takes on it that I hadn't heard,
that I know that actually I was

61
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:33,647
like just looking at my,my
reading list of books that I want

62
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,497
to read in the next couple weeks.
And there were a couple of them I

63
00:03:36,502 --> 00:03:40,038
think that he mentioned that I
have on there too.And so,uh,

64
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:43,217
hopefully you'll find some
resources here.You'll find some

65
00:03:43,217 --> 00:03:48,108
new ideas,exploring motivation,
exploring mental health and all

66
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:50,717
of the things that we talked
about that maybe can be applied

67
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:50,927
to your.

68
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:52,397
Dan: Totally.

69
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:56,448
Bekah: So we start every episode
of the podcast,like we start

70
00:03:56,448 --> 00:03:59,448
every Virtual Coffee.We introduce
ourselves with our name,where

71
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:03,078
we're from,what we do,and a
random check-in question.We hope

72
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:14,554
you enjoy this episode.Today's
random question is,what is your

73
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:20,463
favorite hobby?We hope you enjoy
this episode.Hi,my name is Bekah.

74
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:24,033
I am a technical community
builder from a small town in

75
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:28,653
Ohio,and this is an easy one at
weightlifting is my favorite

76
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:32,673
hobby.I don't really have any
other hobbies besides raising

77
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,434
children and gardening badly,so
that was easy.

78
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:39,918
Dan: Gardening badly.Uh,you could
be bad at something and still

79
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:42,918
have it be your favorite,you
know,but it's probably easier

80
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:45,168
when you're good at something to
have it be your favorite.So

81
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:51,048
that's cool.Um,yeah.I'm Dan.I
live in Cleveland.It was like63

82
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:54,889
here yesterday,and today it is
like38in raining.So that's

83
00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:00,108
Cleveland life for you?Uh,yeah.
Well,it might be coming,I don't

84
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:00,319
know.

85
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:02,449
Bekah: It is Friday.It's gonna be
cold.

86
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:05,749
Dan: Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.And,uh,
favorite hobby?Oh,my favorite

87
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:10,009
hobby is disc golf.So that's golf
played with,uh,you know,flying

88
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,598
discs or Frisbees if you want to
use the brand name.And,uh,yeah,

89
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:17,478
I've been,I got into it in
college and,uh,playing,playing a

90
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:23,163
lot since then.So,just played36
holes on,um,Last Friday.So it's

91
00:05:23,163 --> 00:05:27,403
good stuff.Keeps me in the woods
pretty soon.Uh,I got Ollie,

92
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,793
here's,is he here in the
recording studio with me So

93
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:31,444
pretty soon he's gonna come,
start coming with me too.I'm

94
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:33,274
excited about that.I was looking
into

95
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:37,608
Bekah: I was just gonna say for,
for context,Ollie is Dan's dog.

96
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:41,329
Dan: Yeah,yeah,yeah.And I was,
well,I was about to,I was about

97
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:44,449
to clue that in because I was
looking at disc golf bags for

98
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:49,399
dogs,so I can have him just carry
all of my stuff around you know,

99
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,848
and it,it would be perfect.So,
uh,I'm,that's the dream really.

100
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:53,749
That's,I'm excited about that.

101
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,329
Arthur: All right.Uh,hi.My name's
Arthur Doer or Art.Um,I'm from

102
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:03,048
Omaha,Nebraska,where it is cold
and snowing right now,so you're

103
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:07,459
gonna get it probably in a couple
days.Um,and I'm a senior software

104
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:10,488
engineer and,uh,community and
culture steward is,I think what

105
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:13,636
we're calling the other half of
my title.my favorite hobby is

106
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,615
actually,I don't know if it
counts as a hobby,but public

107
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:20,596
speaking,it's more of a lifestyle
I guess.But,um,it's definitely

108
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:24,786
the thing that takes up a ton of
my time,that is not my job.So

109
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:27,151
Dan: I'd say if you,yeah,if
you're not getting paid for it or

110
00:06:27,151 --> 00:06:29,790
maybe even if you are getting
paid for it,I don't know.I guess,

111
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,161
yeah,if you're just doing it by
choice,then it,then it,we can

112
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:32,971
call it a hobby,right?

113
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:35,865
Arthur: how often do you have to
get paid before it becomes a side

114
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:36,315
gig?Like,

115
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,930
Dan: yeah.That's the,yeah,that's
always the problem.Uh,you know,

116
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:44,656
it is,uh,Sometimes when you're
good at a hobby and it can,you

117
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:47,295
know it's possible to get paid
for it,you know,it becomes tempt

118
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,925
tempting to follow that down.So
just like this,golf,I almost went

119
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:54,466
pro and then,uh,no,I'm just
kidding.I was,I was never good

120
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:54,826
enough.

121
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,451
Bekah: Is there pro disc golf?

122
00:06:57,886 --> 00:07:00,766
Dan: Yeah,big time.Like million
dollar contract.Pro,pro.This

123
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:05,115
golf.Yeah,it's on ESPN and all
that stuff now too.So yeah,it's

124
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:05,446
the same with.

125
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:06,151
Arthur: like,

126
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:09,855
Dan: Well,sure,sure,sure.Yeah.I
mean,this is like,this is the

127
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:12,225
same with lots of sports where
there's companies that want you

128
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:15,045
to buy their products and so they
start sponsoring people that are

129
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,685
really good at it.And that's,you
know,that's,that's how it goes.

130
00:07:17,685 --> 00:07:21,105
And so you,and,and of course the
sponsors,they,you know,they can

131
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:24,906
only use those ones,uh,and they
still win tournaments.And so

132
00:07:24,906 --> 00:07:27,586
you're like,well,I should buy
that company's,you know,discs or

133
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:33,526
shoes or whatever.is a baseball
hat will make me better at disc

134
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:34,096
golf.I'm sure

135
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:40,369
Bekah: For sure.I'm a
professional weightlifter,so

136
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:41,509
Dan: Oh,nice.

137
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:47,149
Bekah: Yeah.Not really I'm just
manifesting it.I think that's how

138
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:51,949
that works.You say it and then
people make you it.So next week,

139
00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:52,819
watch out.

140
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:54,829
Arthur: sponsorship's rolling in.

141
00:07:54,894 --> 00:07:58,053
Dan: the,the thing to watch out
for there,right,is like,oh,you

142
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:00,694
start going to a gym and like,
oh,like,oh,I'll teach a class,

143
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:02,644
you know,here and there,
whatever.And then like you teach

144
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:04,983
'em more and more classes and
then,you know,pretty soon

145
00:08:05,254 --> 00:08:07,173
somebody's like,wanna hire you
full-time.And then it becomes a

146
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:08,434
job and then it's no fun anymore.

147
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:13,608
Bekah: I just,I just want them to
give me workout gear,like,here's

148
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:16,218
a pair of new leggings.Sweet.

149
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,408
Arthur: Exercise influencer.

150
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:19,528
Bekah: I know.

151
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:20,079
Dan: Yeah.

152
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:27,858
Bekah: Yep.maybe that,um,welcome
Arthur.It is good to have you

153
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:32,389
here on the podcast.We always
like to get started with your

154
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:36,499
origin story,and we're gonna
start by asking you what is one

155
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:40,009
word that describes your career
journey?

156
00:08:41,163 --> 00:08:46,203
Arthur: Uh,I think my word is
gonna be concentric,um,in that

157
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:50,494
I've started.I went to school for
computer engineering and then

158
00:08:50,494 --> 00:08:55,024
rapidly realized that that was a
thing that,um,you know,you went

159
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:57,063
to a couple,couple different
companies,like one of a couple

160
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:59,703
companies,and then they burned
you out and then you moved on to

161
00:08:59,703 --> 00:09:05,178
other stuff.But,um,The story of
my career has been kind of ever

162
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:09,739
expanding circles of kind of what
I care about,where it's moved

163
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:13,278
from,caring about the technology
to,okay,let's care about the

164
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,908
architecture.Okay,let's care
about like the process that we're

165
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:22,788
doing to now.It's very about the
humans,um,that either the humans

166
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:25,278
that we're writing the software
for,or the humans who are writing

167
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,908
the software,or the humans who
are affected by the software.So,

168
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:31,624
Bekah: I really love that.

169
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:32,604
Dan: Yeah.

170
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:37,683
Bekah: So how did that,so I,I
like the different concentric

171
00:09:37,683 --> 00:09:40,923
circles and almost,I imagine
there's some kind of journey

172
00:09:40,923 --> 00:09:45,124
behind each of those different
circles and how they're kind of

173
00:09:45,124 --> 00:09:48,874
related to each other.So do you
wanna talk a little bit about

174
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:54,484
maybe I,however you wanna tell
your story of your tech journey.

175
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:57,634
Um,but if there are highlight
moments that you think were

176
00:09:57,634 --> 00:09:59,073
really pivotal there,I'd love to
hear.

177
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,214
Arthur: Sure.Um,I mean,really
it's,it's a,it's a story of

178
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:07,024
getting frustrated a bunch,uh,
and just going like,well,there

179
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:11,464
has to be a better way to do
this.Like,um,I mean,it started

180
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:15,379
out in a,um,I went to a small
technical college in Terre Haute,

181
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:19,639
Indiana,um,and paid a lot of
money to learn the lesson that I

182
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:22,428
am not the smartest person on the
planet,which is a very valuable

183
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:27,798
lesson to learn.Uh,and then kind
of fell back afterwards into a

184
00:10:27,803 --> 00:10:33,678
job,um,doing JSPs.Uh,cuz that
was,that was the style at the

185
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:37,908
time.Um,and.

186
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:39,649
Dan: can you,can you,what are,
what are JSPs?

187
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:43,609
Arthur: Uh,Java server,it pages.
So back in the bad old days of

188
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:48,048
the internet,um,it was,you know,
we didn't have your fancy reacts

189
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,509
or anything.It was all like
server driven,you know,server

190
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:53,719
side stuff.So it was,okay,well
we're gonna write these webpages

191
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:57,589
in Java.Cool.Um,

192
00:10:57,913 --> 00:10:58,278
Dan: sounds great.

193
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:03,528
Arthur: Fantastic.Uh,so I mean,
again,there's like,yeah,there has

194
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:05,479
to be a better way to do this.
What are we doing with our,what

195
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:09,844
am I doing with my life?just been
a lot of being frustrated about,

196
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:14,823
um,the technology that I work
with,the way that we're building

197
00:11:14,823 --> 00:11:18,783
it and kind of realizing,oh,
okay,well this situation gets a

198
00:11:18,783 --> 00:11:22,894
little better if I can affect
something downstream.Like,or

199
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:26,943
upstream rather,like,okay,so if
I'm frustrated about,oh,well I'm,

200
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:31,533
I'm being asked to code something
and I wanna make it great.Okay,

201
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:35,433
that's easy.And then,I mean,it's
not easy,sorry,but it's a,it's a

202
00:11:35,438 --> 00:11:39,739
simpler problem.And then,
Realized that I'm being asked to

203
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:42,259
code something that is stupid.
Why am I being asked to code

204
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:44,989
something that is stupid?Well,
that's what the requirements say,

205
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:48,469
and it's like,okay,so let's move
into that and think about why am

206
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,989
I being asked to code something
that is stupid,that I think is

207
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:53,538
stupid?Does this make sense in a
context?What is the user

208
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:57,259
thinking?And kind of expanding my
scope in that regard.And then

209
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:01,259
starting to realize,well,these
pro,like now we're trying to.

210
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:05,443
Learning these things that make
sense about the users and about

211
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:10,683
what they want,but.You know,we
keep running up in crunch.We keep

212
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:13,744
winding up with a deadline
overrun.So let's think about the

213
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:17,374
process and how are we building
these things.And kind of parallel

214
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:21,124
to all of that has been my
personal journey of trying to

215
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:25,083
understand what the hell is
happening inside of my head.Um,

216
00:12:25,323 --> 00:12:27,663
which is a thing that I've been,
I mean,it's a lifelong struggle,

217
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,303
but it's been something I've been
actively working on since I was

218
00:12:30,303 --> 00:12:37,594
15.Um,And so there's been a lot
of research into,okay,I mean,

219
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:41,014
it's like any good therapist or
psychologist starts out as just

220
00:12:41,014 --> 00:12:43,504
like,well,why am I screwed up?
Let's figure that out.Clearly

221
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:46,443
somebody has understood this and
there must be a book out there

222
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:49,953
that will perfectly describe why
I do the dumb things I do and how

223
00:12:49,953 --> 00:12:52,894
to not do those things,and then
you rapidly realize that that

224
00:12:52,894 --> 00:12:55,323
isn't true.But there's a whole
bunch of other interesting things

225
00:12:55,323 --> 00:12:59,193
that people have learned.Um,so I
vanished down that rabbit hole,

226
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:04,833
um,about at the same time I took
a job.um,drove me back into

227
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,894
therapy.Um,cause I was,you know,
went through the whole therapy

228
00:13:07,894 --> 00:13:11,374
gamut and diagnoses when I was in
middle school and high school and

229
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:16,594
then,uh,kind of fell out of it in
college.Um,stopped taking my meds

230
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:22,953
cuz that's what you do in college
is do dumb things.Um,and yeah,I

231
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:28,053
mean,it's a perfect time for it.
But,um,so this job I was in my,

232
00:13:28,144 --> 00:13:33,244
my late twenties.No,that would've
been early thirties cause that

233
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:40,803
would've been2011ish.Um,and just,
it was a nightmare job.Um,for a

234
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:43,683
bunch of different reasons.
Things like,we released too fast

235
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:47,313
for the support team of the
company.Um,so they refused to

236
00:13:47,313 --> 00:13:49,594
support our products.So all of
our customers called our BA

237
00:13:49,624 --> 00:13:51,663
directly and then she would
immediately wind up on,like,

238
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:57,153
standing on our desks for things.
It was exciting.Um,and it was

239
00:13:57,153 --> 00:14:02,418
all,um,it was election related
stuff,so.Just ratchet all the

240
00:14:02,418 --> 00:14:04,999
stress three notches higher on
all of it.

241
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:05,943
Dan: Yeah.

242
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:10,578
Arthur: Um,I kind of found myself
at a,on the phone with somebody

243
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,308
from,I think it was Hamilton
County,Ohio,actually from their

244
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:16,999
election board.Um,I mean,in the
median age of somebody that works

245
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:22,009
at an election commission
anywhere is like80.So I'm on the

246
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:24,678
phone with this guy attempting to
teach him how to copy paste over

247
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:27,798
the phone.And it was just like
one of those moments you see in a

248
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:30,528
movie where it's.From office
space or whatever,it's just like,

249
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:38,058
what am I doing,Um,so I mean,
about that time I was starting to

250
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:41,719
dig into some stuff like,uh,
Daniel Pink's Drive was one of my

251
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:48,139
gateway drugs to really getting
into,um,What is effectively pop

252
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:52,908
psych,um,you know,popular
psychology books and starting to

253
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:56,479
understand a lot more about
organizational psychology and

254
00:14:56,538 --> 00:15:00,558
behavioral economics and
cognitive psychology and,you

255
00:15:00,558 --> 00:15:05,149
know,chasing down a bunch of
rabbit holes there.And it was not

256
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:11,178
that much later,um,a couple years
into a new job and I realized

257
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:14,854
that I started wanting to get
into public speaking and.Was

258
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:18,274
like,okay,well let's figure out,
you know,I started doing,um,uh,

259
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:20,703
we do lightning talks at work and
we used to do'em every week.We do

260
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:26,344
'em every other week now.But it
was a,um,forced myself to give a

261
00:15:26,344 --> 00:15:30,004
lightning talk every week and
rapidly ran out of technical

262
00:15:30,004 --> 00:15:33,004
things that I wanted to talk
about,and then decided I was

263
00:15:33,004 --> 00:15:34,923
gonna start talking about
cognitive biases at work and

264
00:15:34,923 --> 00:15:39,903
went,wow,this is a lot more fun
and exciting Um,and that was,

265
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:44,089
that was2016.And.Started speaking
at conferences and have been

266
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:49,009
doing that and my making my focus
a lot more about the humans of

267
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:54,528
software since then of,okay,how
do we get people to build these

268
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:58,399
things?Understanding that there
are systemic forces that are

269
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,869
driving this instead of looking
at individuals as the problem or

270
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:06,889
even looking at teams as the
problem.and trying to understand

271
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:08,778
that there,this is stuff we've
been learning about since the

272
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:12,198
fifties for Christ's sake in some
cases.Um,it's one of the most

273
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:14,359
frustrating things about some of
the talks I do is I go back and

274
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:16,428
look at the resources and like
studies and it's like,well,we

275
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:19,938
knew about it in the seventies
and we're still,we're still

276
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,346
screwing this up now so.

277
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:25,691
Dan: an example of is there is an
example that pops in your mind of

278
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:26,740
one of those things?

279
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:28,931
Arthur: I mean,one of the basics
would be from Daniel Pink's

280
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:32,530
drive.Like the,the study research
about intrinsic versus extrinsic

281
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,431
motivations has been around since
the seventies,easily,like as a

282
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:40,510
known fact.And,um,the difference
there is,is an intrinsic

283
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:44,921
motivation is something that is
internal to the person.So,a,if

284
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,711
you work out,for instance,like
Bekah does,one of the values that

285
00:16:47,711 --> 00:16:50,951
you like,the benefits that you
get out of it is in the doing of

286
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:55,750
the.right?The benefit comes from
the act as opposed to an

287
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,951
extrinsic motivation,which is
like paying your kid$5to,uh,take

288
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:06,881
out the guard.It is a motivation,
a r a,uh,impulse that,or rather

289
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:11,651
impetus,rather that is external
to the thing.So without digging

290
00:17:11,651 --> 00:17:14,441
too much into the book and kind
of restating his entire thesis,

291
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:19,480
um,intrinsic motivation is a lot
more sticky.Um,extrinsic

292
00:17:19,486 --> 00:17:22,631
motivation.You,you get what,uh,
some people call the hedonistic

293
00:17:22,631 --> 00:17:26,980
treadmill,um,or hedonistic
acclimation,where after a while

294
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,611
the level of reward you get stops
being effective.Eventually your

295
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:34,661
kid's gonna want10bucks to take
out the garbage.Um,but even

296
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:38,980
without that,it.You can never,I
mean,I don't have kids,but I've

297
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,101
talked to people who do,once you
pay them to do the chores,it's,

298
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,010
you're never gonna not have to
pay them to do the chores again.

299
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:49,691
Uh,it's really one of the big
lessons of that is that extrinsic

300
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:53,290
motivators actually kill
intrinsic motivation.You will be

301
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,320
less intrinsically motivated
after I've,you've applied an

302
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,980
extrinsic motivator,but extrinsic
motivators are easy and.it's easy

303
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,651
for a manager to go,well,we're
just gonna have a thing.And the

304
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:10,090
people personally fixes the most
bugs,gets an Xbox.I mean,most

305
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,270
managers have moved past that
point,but there are still a lot

306
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:18,131
of extrinsic motivation about,
um,you know,even things like

307
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,351
velocity.Are you meeting your
velocity?That's an extrinsic

308
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:23,800
motivator,not an intrinsic
motivator to the task itself.

309
00:18:25,526 --> 00:18:28,645
Bekah: That's really fascinating.
I actually hadn't really thought

310
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:31,826
about it like that.Now I need to
go listen to that book,so that's

311
00:18:31,826 --> 00:18:36,175
gonna be on my list.But I,I think
that the idea of extrinsic

312
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:39,955
motivation,I've been thinking a
lot about company.Culture what?

313
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:43,076
How to determine if a company has
a good culture.We see a lot of

314
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:46,556
people at Virtual Coffee that
interview for roles that seem

315
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:49,256
great,and then they get there and
the company culture is not great.

316
00:18:49,556 --> 00:18:55,105
And oftentimes a lot of the
things that we see is,um,there

317
00:18:55,105 --> 00:18:58,895
are those extrinsic.Motivators,
right?Like,we pay a great salary,

318
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:04,355
we have unlimited paid time off.
We give you a budget for food,we

319
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:08,496
give you a budget for the gym or
whatever.And in a lot of ways,I

320
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:12,486
think that companies are trying
to use,they use extrinsic

321
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:16,986
motivators to kind of lure you in
and make you feel like there's a

322
00:19:16,986 --> 00:19:23,891
good culture there.But maybe that
what,what.Makes a good culture is

323
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:28,070
finding ways to cultivate that
intrinsic motivation.Or at the

324
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:31,871
very least,getting to know your
employees and figuring out how to

325
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:36,431
utilize their strengths and allow
them to fulfill the things that

326
00:19:36,431 --> 00:19:37,240
they're good at doing.

327
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,730
Arthur: or what they want to do.
Right?I mean,if,if I have a.You

328
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,851
know,we have a,I don't wanna say
we at the company,but like in,

329
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:50,471
I've seen cases where folks are
feel frustrated or angry because

330
00:19:50,471 --> 00:19:52,721
they care a lot about something
and they're not being allowed to

331
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:56,411
do it.They care a lot about
quality,they care a lot about the

332
00:19:56,415 --> 00:19:58,931
process and the way that this
thing works.And then the company

333
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:04,090
is not allowing them to go be in
DevOps or in,you know,or shaping

334
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,310
things so that they have a role
to play where they can bring

335
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,076
those desires to bear.And that's
a loss on both sides because now

336
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:12,655
one person's frustrated and then
the company's not seeing a

337
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:16,526
benefit out of it.With that they
could be,um,yeah,it's what I mean

338
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:20,336
by like the extrinsic motivators
are easy.Right.It's one of my

339
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,756
fun,I mean,it's not my favorite
hobby,but it's a fun hobby is if

340
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,756
you go to another company and
they've got like a break room or

341
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:30,266
whatever,a foosball table,like
just.Is the table dusty?Like is

342
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:34,465
anybody actually using it?Um,
like,you know,we have one at our

343
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:36,536
company and you know,people use
it cuz it's like the Foosballs

344
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,935
people are sometimes broken and
there's like pieces and repair

345
00:20:38,935 --> 00:20:43,855
parts around the,the room.Um,you
know,we have a dart board and a,

346
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:46,226
a ping pong table and there's
like just,you open a drawer

347
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,326
somewhere and it's like just full
of ping pong balls cuz people

348
00:20:48,326 --> 00:20:52,405
actually use them and they're,
um,various bits and pieces need

349
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:57,760
repaired.So that's,but it's,
it's,is there a question?They

350
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,161
have these extrinsic motivators,
like you mentioned,uh,unlimited

351
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:04,601
pto the culture set so that you
can actually take it.Is there an

352
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:08,290
expectation that that will
happen?I mean,unlimited PTO can

353
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,641
be a trap where suddenly it's,
oh,I'm gonna take this PTO that I

354
00:21:12,645 --> 00:21:15,070
think I'm allowed to.But there's
a company culture where you

355
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:20,381
actually can take way less PTO
than you would have if it was

356
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:21,971
yours.Right.

357
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:26,067
Bekah: Yeah.I've seen a lot more
job descriptions out there saying

358
00:21:26,097 --> 00:21:32,077
unlimited paid,uh,paid time off.
But mandatory two weeks off or

359
00:21:32,077 --> 00:21:36,307
something like that to indicate
that we have this,but we are

360
00:21:36,307 --> 00:21:39,998
going to force you to take off
two weeks.And even at my company,

361
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:44,768
we have unlimited P T O,but we
also have company-wide days off

362
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:49,938
that are usually,you know,some
type of holiday that we.um,em

363
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:54,948
embrace as a company,right?And so
at the very least,uh,those days,

364
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:58,698
everybody will get off.And that
doesn't,that doesn't happen

365
00:21:58,698 --> 00:22:03,678
everywhere anymore either.I'm
really,it amazes me that there

366
00:22:03,682 --> 00:22:07,337
are companies out there that say,
Hey,you get two or three weeks

367
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,138
off during the year.If you wanna
use'em on those days,use'em on

368
00:22:10,144 --> 00:22:13,097
those days.But we're not taking
company wide holidays,which is

369
00:22:14,087 --> 00:22:14,657
kind of mind.

370
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:18,417
Arthur: I find that for a lot of
cases to be,um,I mean that's

371
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:20,577
where,where I work does that,
it's easier from an

372
00:22:20,577 --> 00:22:26,667
administrative standpoint.It's
also,it can be more flexible for

373
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:31,317
a diverse workplace.Um,
especially when,you know,a lot of

374
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:36,268
major holidays in the US are
religious to an extent,um,or at

375
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:39,807
least some of the,you know,the
huge ones.And so it's a question

376
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:41,877
of,okay,well how do you,how do
you accommodate things like

377
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:46,948
Ramadan at your workplace?Um,so
it can be a way to do that,but a

378
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,617
lot of cases it's not,it's just
an,you know,it's a little easier

379
00:22:49,617 --> 00:22:52,528
to be an accounting,uh,to manage
it from an accounting

380
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:56,218
perspective.And then it's a
question,like you said,it's,am I

381
00:22:56,218 --> 00:23:01,288
gonna work that day?Well,I
should.Okay.I guess I'm gonna,

382
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:05,097
you know,maybe I'll work remote
now after the pandemic,but I'm

383
00:23:05,097 --> 00:23:06,958
still,you know,gonna clock the
hours.

384
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,728
Bekah: Yeah.And all of those
things are super tricky,

385
00:23:09,728 --> 00:23:13,567
especially in the remote world
where it's almost like work

386
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:16,958
doesn't ever turn off.Especially
if you're working on a team that

387
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,867
has people in lots of different
time zones or you know,if they're

388
00:23:19,873 --> 00:23:23,137
a global organization,then
somebody is always working.And I

389
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:26,018
know,like,at least from my
perspective,I have a hard time

390
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:30,147
turning work off,you know?Slack
or email on my phone frequently.

391
00:23:30,147 --> 00:23:32,728
And sometimes I'll delete them
and then it's like,well,I'm

392
00:23:32,728 --> 00:23:36,238
traveling so I need to ha have
access to this somehow and it

393
00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:40,827
gets back on my phone.But,but
there's this,I think that tech

394
00:23:40,827 --> 00:23:45,208
can be really hard right now in
the fact that it's,it can be very

395
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:50,607
hard to turn off because of the
continued,somebody is always

396
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:51,478
working right.

397
00:23:51,593 --> 00:23:54,442
Arthur: Mm-hmm.Well,and some
people like it,like I have

398
00:23:54,792 --> 00:24:00,772
coworkers.I way more time than I
would ever want to spend.But to

399
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:05,002
them,it's not a question of,
being unsustainable.That's just

400
00:24:05,008 --> 00:24:09,232
the pace that they like and the
way that they like to work.And

401
00:24:09,593 --> 00:24:11,752
you get,you can get trapped,kind
of holding yourself up to a

402
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:15,053
standard for somebody else that
doesn't meet your,your lifestyle.

403
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:18,803
Uh,but you can also get trapped
by,I mean,I talked about kind of

404
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:25,387
my journey concentric,right?Um,
as you.Okay,so let's start with

405
00:24:25,387 --> 00:24:29,288
the thesis.Um,that tech is
actually creative work.

406
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:30,682
Bekah: Hmm.

407
00:24:30,788 --> 00:24:35,708
Arthur: really engineering work.
Um,I know that's a huge bombshell

408
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:41,587
for argument,but.Tech is in,a lot
of tech is not.We're doing the

409
00:24:41,587 --> 00:24:44,498
same thing over and over.It is,
we're kind of doing the same

410
00:24:44,498 --> 00:24:46,867
thing,but these things are
different and it's weirdly

411
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:49,988
innovative and new in this way,
and this situation is different.

412
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,107
The user wants this piece
slightly different this time.So

413
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:55,988
there's a bunch of novelty every
time.And that novelty means that

414
00:24:55,988 --> 00:25:00,097
we have to be creative.And the
thing about creative work is

415
00:25:00,097 --> 00:25:03,337
that,I mean,you can go ask the UX
folks at your work.I mean,if

416
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:09,248
they'd been through like a.
Curriculum.Right?Um,they learn

417
00:25:09,248 --> 00:25:14,557
fairly quickly that there is no
turning that off.Uh,there is no

418
00:25:14,587 --> 00:25:18,127
moment where your brain won't tap
you on the shoulder and be like,

419
00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:20,678
Hey,that thing you thought you
were,you know,you were thinking

420
00:25:20,678 --> 00:25:26,587
about.Uh,yeah.We have the answer
to that now.if you can't,I mean,

421
00:25:26,948 --> 00:25:29,798
trust me,if we could turn the
brain off,it would be,life would

422
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:31,387
be a lot easier on a number of
fronts,but

423
00:25:32,843 --> 00:25:33,333
Dan: True.

424
00:25:33,718 --> 00:25:36,772
Arthur: if,if you know you since
you can't turn it off,how do you

425
00:25:37,393 --> 00:25:42,682
navigate that balance between,
or,or find a balance between,um,

426
00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:46,343
hey,this is when my brain decides
that it would be productive for

427
00:25:46,343 --> 00:25:50,692
me to work,versus how do I
maintain that balance,you know,

428
00:25:50,698 --> 00:25:54,232
that,that the distance between me
and the actual job so that the

429
00:25:54,232 --> 00:25:59,002
job doesn't flow backward into my
life and define me.And that's,

430
00:25:59,063 --> 00:26:01,958
um,I mean,there's no simple
answer to that.

431
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:04,972
Bekah: Yeah,if there is,let me
know cuz I

432
00:26:05,192 --> 00:26:05,682
Dan: Yeah.

433
00:26:05,992 --> 00:26:06,893
Bekah: been working on that.

434
00:26:07,762 --> 00:26:10,942
Dan: I love that framing though.
The,the job floating,floating

435
00:26:10,942 --> 00:26:12,982
back.Wait,how did you say it?I'm
sorry.Cuz it was

436
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:15,228
Arthur: Yeah.The job flowing
backward into your life.

437
00:26:15,353 --> 00:26:18,413
Dan: flowing backward into your
life.Yeah,that was,I,I I love

438
00:26:18,413 --> 00:26:22,133
that.Um,just that framing of that
whole problem.It,it's such a,

439
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:24,712
that's a really nice metaphor.
I'm,I'm a collector of metaphors

440
00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:29,123
and I,I like that one.Uh,and it's
a problem in it,and it's like a

441
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:31,583
great way to frame it,right?
Because you,you know,you,you have

442
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:35,482
a job and.Obsessively need to get
work done and all that stuff.But

443
00:26:35,482 --> 00:26:38,242
you don't want your job
necessarily to be defining

444
00:26:38,242 --> 00:26:41,002
things.And I think we talk about
it or defining things in your

445
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:43,192
life,you know,and I think we talk
about it in different ways.

446
00:26:43,373 --> 00:26:45,893
Work-life balance is like a
phrase that gets thrown around a

447
00:26:45,893 --> 00:26:49,252
lot.All all that stuff.But that
idea of that flow,you know,and,

448
00:26:49,252 --> 00:26:53,083
and having your decisions,like
what is driving your.Decision

449
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:56,893
making in your life,uh,is,I mean,
that's obviously,like you said,

450
00:26:56,893 --> 00:26:59,833
that's a big problem and,and not
an easy answer,but,um,I think

451
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:02,202
that framing is,is really useful
and I,I like that idea,

452
00:27:03,157 --> 00:27:05,228
Arthur: Well,and it's easy things
to be like.It's an easy thing to

453
00:27:05,228 --> 00:27:07,988
say,Hey,we pro,we strive to
promote a good work-life balance

454
00:27:07,988 --> 00:27:12,278
here.Um,and then you get into the
thick of it.Like,I mean,like

455
00:27:12,307 --> 00:27:15,428
Bekah was talking about companies
that promote that.As,you know,

456
00:27:15,428 --> 00:27:18,397
here we,you know,we love to
balance work and play or

457
00:27:18,397 --> 00:27:22,748
whatever,and I mean,sometimes
that's a huge red flag.Um,

458
00:27:25,147 --> 00:27:28,567
Especially like the phrase,work
hard,play hard,like that one's a

459
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:30,067
huge red flag.Um,

460
00:27:30,143 --> 00:27:30,823
Dan: Nope,Nope.

461
00:27:31,438 --> 00:27:37,853
Arthur: but.It's easy to say
that.And then what you see in

462
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:42,053
practice is a series of
exceptions where it's,oh,well,

463
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:44,692
just this once,okay,just this
time,well,this thing's happening

464
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:47,903
and I need to get this done.And
th and tho it's a death of a

465
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:52,403
thousand cuts where,um,that those
exceptions become the norm and

466
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:58,147
they define the norm.And if you
don't have cultural.Guardrails

467
00:27:58,147 --> 00:28:02,198
around that at a corporate level,
at a team level.Cuz it can't just

468
00:28:02,198 --> 00:28:05,137
be corporate.It has to actually
be at the team levels as well.

469
00:28:05,137 --> 00:28:07,538
Cause it's easy,again,to say at
the corporate level,well,don't do

470
00:28:07,538 --> 00:28:10,478
this in your teams.And then the
manager,you know,it happens and

471
00:28:10,478 --> 00:28:13,087
the manager gets a slap on the
wrist and says,don't do that with

472
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:16,208
your teams.And meanwhile their
team is burnt out and chattered.

473
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:24,233
Um,so it,it's,you can't just,
especially,you know,if you're.I

474
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:26,063
know through in Virtual Coffee
you have a lot of folks that are

475
00:28:26,063 --> 00:28:29,512
breaking into dev,into,into being
devs.You don't have a ton of

476
00:28:29,512 --> 00:28:35,752
power there.Um,especially since
there is a,there's often a high

477
00:28:35,752 --> 00:28:41,452
supply of new devs,right?It is a
career that does pay a lot.Um,it

478
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:44,452
has a lot of upward mobility.It
has a bunch of cool benefits.

479
00:28:44,452 --> 00:28:46,643
Like you get to work with code,
you get to work with really cool

480
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:50,722
problems.Uh,it is a desirable
career,so the supply of new devs

481
00:28:50,722 --> 00:28:55,327
can often.You know,large,and that
means that you have less

482
00:28:55,327 --> 00:29:00,127
leverage.So,you know,as a junior
dev,it's really hard to be like,

483
00:29:00,577 --> 00:29:03,758
no,I'm gonna go do disc golf
tomorrow and not show up at work.

484
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:07,298
Like,you can't,how,how do you
have that discussion with your

485
00:29:07,298 --> 00:29:10,117
manager when your manager is
like,but the client is,you know,

486
00:29:10,258 --> 00:29:12,968
having this,you know,there's a
hair fire and you have to deal

487
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:17,107
with it and you're the only one
that can handle it.Um,so as some

488
00:29:17,107 --> 00:29:23,603
of that has to be at that level
of the manager doing,Um,that

489
00:29:23,603 --> 00:29:26,182
guidance,but it can't,again,it
can't just be the manager either.

490
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:30,083
It has,that actually has to exist
almost like fractally at each

491
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:32,932
level of the organization where
everybody is working to protect

492
00:29:32,932 --> 00:29:35,333
that because everybody benefits
from it.

493
00:29:37,087 --> 00:29:41,377
Dan: My,my wife at her last job
had a bad culture like that,you

494
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:44,708
know,the,the,like,the bad example
of this.And she was a manager,

495
00:29:44,712 --> 00:29:48,458
you know,in her own right and she
felt very strongly ab,you know,

496
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:52,952
in favor of protecting her,you
know.You know,her direct reports

497
00:29:53,073 --> 00:29:55,232
and things like that.But it's
exactly what you're saying

498
00:29:55,232 --> 00:29:57,992
happened,you know,is that she
would protect the people that

499
00:29:57,992 --> 00:30:01,442
reported to her,but nobody was
protecting her.And,and so she got

500
00:30:01,442 --> 00:30:03,512
burned out.Honestly,she got
burned out.Her man,her,her

501
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:06,212
reportees were like,loved her and
was like,you're the best manager

502
00:30:06,212 --> 00:30:09,272
ever.And she's like,I'm getting
out of here You know,like right

503
00:30:09,272 --> 00:30:12,833
now,cuz uh,is is the same thing
cuz it was a,it was a cultural

504
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:17,258
thing.It went way.to the top,you
know?Um,so I,I was wondering,you

505
00:30:17,258 --> 00:30:20,167
know,listening to you talk and,
and,um,with the amount of like,

506
00:30:20,377 --> 00:30:24,067
thought you've put into this,uh,
do you have any advice for people

507
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:27,518
who find themselves especially,
especially,uh,lower,you know,uh,

508
00:30:27,548 --> 00:30:29,708
newer devs,do you have any advice
for people who find themselves in

509
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:33,788
those situations?Um,where they
are,they don't have a lot of

510
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:36,488
power.They don't have a lot of,
you know,they can't like throw

511
00:30:36,488 --> 00:30:40,823
their weight around but are being
asked to.maybe do things that

512
00:30:40,823 --> 00:30:43,762
they are,that are outside of
where they would like their

513
00:30:43,762 --> 00:30:47,992
boundaries to be.Um,you know,
like is there any actual advice

514
00:30:47,992 --> 00:30:52,012
aside from finding a new job?Uh,
which is a fine piece of advice,

515
00:30:52,012 --> 00:30:56,063
honestly,that I've given before,
but not,you know,not always,uh,

516
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:57,232
possible So,

517
00:30:57,607 --> 00:31:00,067
Arthur: I mean,it's a,I often,I
have a toll talk on burnout that

518
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,258
I talk about,and it's like one of
the options for burnout is find a

519
00:31:02,262 --> 00:31:05,557
new job.But not everybody can do
that for a lot of different

520
00:31:05,557 --> 00:31:06,758
reasons.Um,

521
00:31:06,817 --> 00:31:09,637
Dan: it,it could take a long time
too,so you could still be stuck.

522
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:10,117
Yeah.

523
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:18,588
Arthur: So my best advice in
those cases is kind of to,I tend

524
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:22,897
to think of it in terms of almost
Aikido.Um,Which is,if you're not

525
00:31:22,897 --> 00:31:25,448
familiar,it's a martial arts
style that is very focused on,

526
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:31,147
um,as they would frame it,like
redirection of energy.And what

527
00:31:31,147 --> 00:31:33,788
they mean by that is typically
that in Aikido it is entirely

528
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:38,498
defensive.Um,and you are
typically taking somebody,

529
00:31:38,498 --> 00:31:42,907
throwing a punch at you,somebody
throwing a kick at you,and you.

530
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:49,178
Blocking,but taking that energy
and re taking their motion,their

531
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:52,087
momentum,their actual velocity,
and redirecting it in a direction

532
00:31:52,087 --> 00:31:58,718
that you want,um,you can use
those moments to kind of do the

533
00:31:58,718 --> 00:32:04,087
same thing to haggle in the
moment about,okay,if we're gonna

534
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:07,417
do this,then we need something
else.Like,what can you give me in

535
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:09,758
that moment?Right?Because in
those moments,you do have a

536
00:32:09,758 --> 00:32:13,897
little more power of.They want
this exception,they want this

537
00:32:13,903 --> 00:32:16,778
thing.You can turn around and
say,you know,accept that thing

538
00:32:16,778 --> 00:32:20,048
and try and in the,you know,the
best terms of improv.Yes.And it,

539
00:32:20,617 --> 00:32:26,377
right.Um,where you're giving them
what they want and then trying to

540
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,738
go,okay,but I would like comp
time tomorrow for this.Or,can you

541
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:34,972
give me off Friday so that I can
go to this appointment?if you're

542
00:32:34,978 --> 00:32:38,813
not making a ton of leverage,
they're trying to,I mean,not to,

543
00:32:39,532 --> 00:32:43,103
um,immediately politicize it,but
trying to almost unionize to some

544
00:32:43,103 --> 00:32:49,192
degree of,can you as a team
define your working structure as

545
00:32:49,192 --> 00:32:54,502
a uh,individual?Can you find
other people who agree with you

546
00:32:54,502 --> 00:32:58,042
about,Hey,we don't want to do X,
we don't want to do Y.And try and

547
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:04,327
make that the norm inside of your
team itself.Um,And the key thing

548
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:07,028
here is you don't wanna try,I
mean,you don't wanna alienate the

549
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:09,607
manager,right?Because if you
start doing that,then you wind up

550
00:33:09,607 --> 00:33:12,038
in a situation where you've
immediately created an US versus

551
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:15,337
then situation.And once you do
that,there's a whole bunch of

552
00:33:15,337 --> 00:33:17,798
human psychology that starts
coming into play where it's so

553
00:33:17,803 --> 00:33:22,208
much easier to demonize the other
person to,uh,believe that they

554
00:33:22,212 --> 00:33:26,317
are,you know,that their actions
are due to innate,um,attributes.

555
00:33:26,407 --> 00:33:28,417
Uh,there's this thing called the,
well,in this case it would be the

556
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:32,932
ultimate attribution error where,
um,We have what's called in

557
00:33:32,932 --> 00:33:35,542
groups and outgroups,where an
in-group is a group you're part

558
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:38,722
of,and an OUTGROUP is a group
that you're not part of.Um,we

559
00:33:38,722 --> 00:33:41,722
tend to believe that our
outgroups,you know,groups that

560
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:44,962
we're not part of,they behave
certain ways because of innate

561
00:33:44,962 --> 00:33:49,163
attributes of those groups.Um,so
as an example,like qa,people are

562
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:54,893
all extremely persnickety and
uptight,right?Or,you know,for the

563
00:33:54,893 --> 00:33:59,692
opposite way,devs are completely
loose and utterly lazy and have

564
00:33:59,692 --> 00:34:03,772
no,you know,rigor or,uh,
coherence to their work.Right.

565
00:34:04,597 --> 00:34:04,897
Dan: Right.

566
00:34:06,472 --> 00:34:08,663
Arthur: neither true,but it's
easy when you're on the other

567
00:34:08,663 --> 00:34:11,663
side of it looking in and it's,
it's a shortcut your brain takes

568
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:17,753
basically to go,okay,we can think
about people in this way.Um,So

569
00:34:17,992 --> 00:34:20,842
alienating your manager and you
want to kind of pull them in and

570
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:24,023
be like,okay,you're part of the
team.We are together on this.We

571
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:28,282
all want to succeed.Um,which is
true to an extent in that you

572
00:34:28,282 --> 00:34:35,963
have a shared goal,um,with,you
know,the rest of your team.You,I

573
00:34:35,963 --> 00:34:40,012
at least hopefully all want to
deliver good software.Right.And I

574
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:43,733
mean,if you don't,then you're in
a harder position where now you

575
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:47,512
have to try and find something
that does unify you,um,with this

576
00:34:47,512 --> 00:34:51,293
manager,et cetera.I mean,in the
cases where you can't make any

577
00:34:51,293 --> 00:34:55,268
inroads and you can't,you know,
they're completely,uh,othering

578
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:59,137
you,as in they're gonna manage at
you and they don't consider

579
00:34:59,137 --> 00:35:01,688
themselves part of the team.
Those are harder situations,and

580
00:35:01,688 --> 00:35:04,927
those are the ones where I would
start going.Maybe you can try and

581
00:35:04,927 --> 00:35:08,168
find a lateral move in the
company.Maybe you can try and,

582
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,867
you know,um,yeah.

583
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,853
Dan: Yeah,no,there,there is.I
mean,there definitely are just

584
00:35:13,853 --> 00:35:19,012
situations where the manager is
either unaware of those issues

585
00:35:19,103 --> 00:35:23,213
and,you know,or,or,or knows about
'em and doesn't care.right?Like,

586
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:26,213
you know,they're feeling pressure
from above somehow.And,you know,

587
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:28,853
uh,they deal with it in,in
different ways,obviously.

588
00:35:29,543 --> 00:35:30,143
Arthur: Well,I mean,they can

589
00:35:30,248 --> 00:35:32,797
Dan: times where there's,where
there's no solution really with

590
00:35:32,813 --> 00:35:33,563
Arthur: they can be burned out

591
00:35:33,637 --> 00:35:37,208
Dan: a manager.Right?Exactly.
Yeah.And like lots of people,I

592
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:40,507
think,experience burnout in
different ways.And react,react,

593
00:35:40,568 --> 00:35:44,378
reacted to burnout in different
ways.Um,or just even pre burnout,

594
00:35:44,378 --> 00:35:49,027
you know,like,uh,stress you know,
people react to,uh,all sorts of

595
00:35:49,027 --> 00:35:51,608
inputs in different ways.So,um

596
00:35:51,893 --> 00:35:54,713
Arthur: once you're at a manager
level,um,there's all kinds of

597
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:59,963
internal status things that start
pinging in your head about,you

598
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:02,543
know,uh,human group dynamic stuff
that starts caring about like,

599
00:36:02,572 --> 00:36:06,682
oh,I have a certain amount of
status in this group,in this,in

600
00:36:06,682 --> 00:36:11,648
this workplace,and.This is where
like if you're,this is where the

601
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,407
Aikido thing comes in.Cuz if you
start immediately coming against

602
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:17,858
them,they start responding.And
this is a challenge to their

603
00:36:17,858 --> 00:36:18,458
authority.

604
00:36:19,643 --> 00:36:19,963
Dan: Mm-hmm.

605
00:36:20,108 --> 00:36:22,898
Arthur: not necessarily because
they're bad people,right?Uh,this

606
00:36:22,898 --> 00:36:26,168
is just a natural human thing to,
especially if you're doing it in

607
00:36:26,168 --> 00:36:30,038
public,in meetings,their brain,
like,you know,the monkey brain

608
00:36:30,038 --> 00:36:33,128
starts screaming,just going like,
duh,what do you do?Like,you've

609
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:35,527
gotta stand up for yourself.
You've gotta demonstrate that you

610
00:36:35,532 --> 00:36:41,032
are in charge.Um,and I mean,
that's something they can combat

611
00:36:41,302 --> 00:36:46,492
and should be working to combat,
right?But,uh,it is definitely a

612
00:36:46,492 --> 00:36:51,143
human response to respond that
way or to feel those emotions in

613
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:56,543
that moment.Uh,and so what if you
can help them through that?Uh,

614
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,603
that makes it a little easier to
have those negotiations,to have

615
00:36:59,603 --> 00:37:00,083
those discuss.

616
00:37:01,193 --> 00:37:06,893
Dan: Yeah.Right.Uh,yeah,if,if you
can like align on the goals,like

617
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:09,202
you said,everybody want on the
team wants to make a good product

618
00:37:09,202 --> 00:37:15,083
or whatever,right?And so keeping
that goal,Mind,you know,um,seems

619
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:18,862
like a way to work together,to,
to get things done right.Uh,and

620
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:22,463
like there's,there's deadlines,
there's,you know,always,oh,

621
00:37:22,463 --> 00:37:25,103
probably lots of times.Too much
work for everybody.And,you know,

622
00:37:25,552 --> 00:37:28,672
um,just kind of remembering,I
think you said remember that the

623
00:37:28,672 --> 00:37:32,693
other person has like emotions
and has,you know,their own,their

624
00:37:32,693 --> 00:37:35,512
own things going on.Uh,I think
we'll take you a long way.Um,I

625
00:37:35,512 --> 00:37:38,632
try to use that,that sort of
empathy in all,all these kinds of

626
00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:44,248
situations,but that.Um,you know,
human thinking,like remembering

627
00:37:44,248 --> 00:37:47,708
the people on the other end of
anything is,are people right?And

628
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:52,688
have their own have their own.
Uh,Hey Bekah,you okay?You just

629
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:53,708
smacked your microphone there,

630
00:37:53,768 --> 00:37:56,407
Bekah: Sorry,trying to come back
quiet.

631
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:00,907
Dan: yeah,yeah.You know,you
failed at that one.Um,but what I

632
00:38:00,907 --> 00:38:02,858
was saying was,um,remembering
that people have their own

633
00:38:02,858 --> 00:38:05,108
motivations and trying to figure
out what they are,you know,uh,

634
00:38:05,288 --> 00:38:07,657
it,I mean,it can help you in a
lot of ways.I think people have

635
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:11,782
talked about that with winning.
Winning haggling situations,but

636
00:38:11,782 --> 00:38:15,413
like it can help you and just not
in that and not in devious ways,

637
00:38:15,413 --> 00:38:20,092
but like understanding where
people are coming from,um,I think

638
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:23,003
can help you get what you want
and also what they want together,

639
00:38:23,588 --> 00:38:24,773
Right.That's,

640
00:38:24,818 --> 00:38:25,568
Arthur: Well,that's exactly it.

641
00:38:25,612 --> 00:38:26,242
Dan: that's the ideal,

642
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:30,547
Arthur: We often approach
conflict as a,um,uh,what ar shown

643
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:36,608
term model one,um,which is a,it
is an,a combative,uh,zero sum

644
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:40,447
game where you are working to
control the emotions of the other

645
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:46,297
participant.Um,where you are,if
you win,they lose and vice versa.

646
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:52,657
And if we look at conflict in
that lens,y.I mean,it's possible,

647
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:56,108
but you're in for a hard fight
right now.You've gotta bat

648
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,478
somebody down.If you're a
manager,you're trying to do

649
00:38:58,478 --> 00:39:02,438
things like,uh,have quick
conversations so that you are

650
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:05,168
the,there's no time for the
emotion.It's like,well,here's

651
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:08,197
your performance review and this
is,and here's the things that you

652
00:39:08,202 --> 00:39:10,867
can do to improve.And then the,
and the meeting's over and the

653
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:13,148
person's still like sitting there
processing their own emotions.

654
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:17,018
Um,but you win because you don't
have to have the hard

655
00:39:17,018 --> 00:39:20,873
conversation or,you know,see
them.And emotionally respond to

656
00:39:20,873 --> 00:39:27,802
any of it.Um,and the alternative
to model one is model two,which

657
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:33,413
is,I mean,they're not great at
naming things,but,um,it is a,a

658
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:37,072
collaborative win-win approach
where you are recognizing that

659
00:39:37,762 --> 00:39:40,583
conflict is,is inherently
emotional,that humans are

660
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:44,663
inherently emotional and you're
respecting and acknowledging the

661
00:39:44,663 --> 00:39:49,972
emotions of others,including
yourself.and attempting to find a

662
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:54,742
situation that benefits all
parties to a,you know,it's

663
00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:57,242
stereotypical,but to find those
win-win situations.

664
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:59,882
Dan: Yeah,absolutely.Go ahead.

665
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:03,030
Bekah: was just gonna say,like,
I,I think as part of that,it's

666
00:40:03,061 --> 00:40:06,391
really important to understand
how people communicate,right?

667
00:40:06,391 --> 00:40:11,460
Like for me,I,my emotions go from
zero to a hundred in like a split

668
00:40:11,465 --> 00:40:16,081
second,right?And so if there's a
situation that I know is going to

669
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:19,501
be an emotional one,I'll ask
people like,Hey,can you gimme a

670
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:23,161
heads up before we talk about
this?Or,I'm,I'm getting better at

671
00:40:23,161 --> 00:40:27,351
saying like,before I just like
jump into my emotional response.

672
00:40:28,545 --> 00:40:31,846
Can we take a step back and talk
about this later?Uh,because I

673
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:35,146
know that I'm not going to give
the response that I want to be

674
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:39,226
giving,and it's not gonna be
productive for anyone in that

675
00:40:39,226 --> 00:40:44,101
situation,right?And I think that.
Understanding that we communicate

676
00:40:44,101 --> 00:40:49,920
in different ways,that we,um,we
receive feedback in different

677
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,880
ways is incredibly important to
finding that place where you can

678
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:57,090
have that productive conversation
where you can have those hard

679
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,851
conver,nobody,I mean,I don't
think anybody likes to have hard

680
00:40:59,851 --> 00:41:05,311
conversations.I don't,it takes a
lot of work to do that,right?And

681
00:41:05,311 --> 00:41:11,420
so finding the best way to do
that.Is going to benefit everyone

682
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:14,081
and then you'll be able to grow
through those conversations.

683
00:41:15,615 --> 00:41:18,195
Arthur: I think what you're,
there's two things I want I want

684
00:41:18,195 --> 00:41:23,385
to touch on that you pulled,you
mentioned,um,the first is that

685
00:41:23,385 --> 00:41:26,715
there is some degree of,uh,the
concept's called it kind of

686
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:32,581
called managing upward.Um,but it
works regardless of.The

687
00:41:32,581 --> 00:41:35,371
description of the concept is
that you are providing

688
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:39,451
information to your superiors
about how you work and what the

689
00:41:39,451 --> 00:41:43,561
best way to manage you is.Um,
there is a tendency to believe

690
00:41:43,561 --> 00:41:47,130
that just because somebody is a
manager,that they have.All seeing

691
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:52,451
human powers,um,is absolutely not
true.Uh,you know,they're,they're

692
00:41:52,451 --> 00:41:55,440
just people like you,right?So
they don't necessarily,I mean,in

693
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,050
a lot of cases,especially in
tech,they are somebody who was

694
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,391
really good at the tech side.And
it's like,well,what's the program

695
00:42:00,391 --> 00:42:03,670
motion path?Well,now you're a
tech lead.great.And you have all

696
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:06,161
of these human things that you've
never had any training in and

697
00:42:06,161 --> 00:42:09,400
never,you don't have a ton of
experience in.Um,so helping them

698
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,891
out and be like,well,this is how
I respond to things.This is the

699
00:42:11,891 --> 00:42:14,650
best way to tell me about X.This
is the best way to do that can

700
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,931
help.But that doesn't have to be
just that their manager that can

701
00:42:16,936 --> 00:42:19,871
actually be at your entire team.
This is the best way to work with

702
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:23,940
me.This is the way that I tend to
respond to things.But the other

703
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,090
piece that Bekah mentioned that I
wanna pull up is,is making space

704
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:30,001
for your emotions and making
space for emotions and work in

705
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:36,300
general.Um,which sounds like,I
mean,we're,you know,in the tech

706
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,021
space,so it's like har,we don't
want to talk about any of that.

707
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:44,521
Um,god forbid we ever admit that
we're angry about something or,

708
00:42:44,701 --> 00:42:51,585
you know,upset or scared about
something.Um,I think that

709
00:42:52,806 --> 00:42:54,795
recognizing and making space for
your own emotions is important.

710
00:42:54,795 --> 00:42:58,635
So as a,as a perfect example for
Junior Debs,um,if you didn't go

711
00:42:58,635 --> 00:43:02,505
through like again,an art school
education,um,art school,they,

712
00:43:02,565 --> 00:43:06,615
they train you about on how to
literally separate yourself from

713
00:43:06,615 --> 00:43:13,590
your creations.We don't get that.
What we get is,You code.If you do

714
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:19,351
good code,you are good developer.
And that in like ties our concept

715
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,971
of,wait,the,the flip side of that
is if I don't code well I'm not a

716
00:43:23,971 --> 00:43:27,300
good developer.So when we start
doing peer reviews or pull

717
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,760
request or whatever your
methodology is for these things,

718
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,621
or even peer programming,um,
Where you code a thing and

719
00:43:35,021 --> 00:43:37,621
somebody says,that's not right,
here's the right way to do it.

720
00:43:38,521 --> 00:43:41,371
Now you've got a moment in your
brain where your brain is like,

721
00:43:41,731 --> 00:43:45,451
oh no,I've gotten conflicting
information.Um,I wanna believe

722
00:43:45,451 --> 00:43:48,331
I'm a good developer,but somebody
has just told me I did a bad

723
00:43:48,331 --> 00:43:54,210
thing.So am bad developer,and it
helps to have a moment to go.

724
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:59,416
Okay.I'm just,I know that I'm
gonna respond to this poorly,so

725
00:43:59,655 --> 00:44:03,195
I'm going to,like Bekah said,
take a moment to go.Can we talk

726
00:44:03,195 --> 00:44:06,237
about this tomorrow?Or in a case
of a peer review,to explicitly be

727
00:44:06,242 --> 00:44:09,496
like,I'm gonna take a minute to
think about this.Um,and that

728
00:44:09,501 --> 00:44:12,795
could go for being a reviewer as
well.I know there are moments

729
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:19,036
where I look at like the PR and,
uh,I,I,you know,make a comment.

730
00:44:19,036 --> 00:44:22,606
I'm like,I don't like this.I
don't know why I don't like this,

731
00:44:23,626 --> 00:44:27,315
but I'm gonna try and figure it
out.Give me24hours.And I'd sit

732
00:44:27,315 --> 00:44:29,445
back like,cuz I'm having an
immediate gut response of like,

733
00:44:29,445 --> 00:44:33,135
that's wrong cuz my brain is
telling me that.And I don't

734
00:44:33,135 --> 00:44:36,990
necessarily know why.So I give
myself some time to think about

735
00:44:36,996 --> 00:44:39,840
it,to chew on it,and I come back
to it and I go,okay,if I have a

736
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,181
reason,I can put the reason in.
If I don't have a reason,I

737
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:45,030
basically say,all right,I don't
still don't like it,but I don't

738
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:48,210
have a reason for it.So go ahead.
Um,

739
00:44:48,221 --> 00:44:52,036
Dan: yeah.That's awesome.I That's
a great idea on a poll request

740
00:44:52,036 --> 00:44:55,425
too,cuz Yeah.I was,you.Wanna get
it,like to hit submit.You want to

741
00:44:55,431 --> 00:44:57,885
have all of your thoughts in
order.But I think that idea of

742
00:44:57,885 --> 00:45:01,786
saying,Hey man,like,you know,
just like,pause on this for a

743
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:04,306
second cuz like something,you
know,I wanna think about this a

744
00:45:04,306 --> 00:45:06,826
little bit longer.You know,I'm
not ignoring your poll request.

745
00:45:07,065 --> 00:45:08,985
You know what I mean?Uh,I just
wanna like get through it.I think

746
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:10,036
that's great advice.I like that.

747
00:45:11,505 --> 00:45:13,485
Arthur: It just gives them a
little breathing room from,I

748
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:17,536
mean,it's a space for those
emotions to exist,right?And the

749
00:45:17,536 --> 00:45:19,005
same thing can be true,
especially in things like

750
00:45:19,005 --> 00:45:22,545
retrospectives.We,I mean,if
you're using an agile philosophy

751
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:25,096
or whatever,or you know,
explicitly scrum,you get these

752
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:29,911
retrospectives.And a lot of the
time it's.Um,okay,well,we're

753
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:31,771
gonna make complaints about a
bunch of things that we can't

754
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:37,860
control.uh,or a bunch of
completely superfluous,like,oh,

755
00:45:37,865 --> 00:45:40,590
well,maybe we could be slightly
better about pointing things.

756
00:45:40,596 --> 00:45:45,030
This,like,you're,you're nibbling
around the edges of these,um,I

757
00:45:45,036 --> 00:45:49,471
don't wanna say useless,but not
often super productive,uh,

758
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:52,561
changes that you make to the way
that your process works,et

759
00:45:52,565 --> 00:45:55,891
cetera.Instead of asking
questions about,well,what are the

760
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:59,610
emotions we have about this?What
are people getting frustrated

761
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:05,521
about?Um,and what are the things
that,I mean,we've used a,a thing

762
00:46:05,525 --> 00:46:08,371
in our own retros,like,uh,on the
team I'm currently on,it's like

763
00:46:08,376 --> 00:46:12,121
the,the glad,mad,sad retro board.
Like they're a million different

764
00:46:12,126 --> 00:46:15,990
types of retros.Cuz at this point
I think somebody has a job where

765
00:46:16,021 --> 00:46:21,181
they're just cranking'em out.Um,
but like we use,like,we use this

766
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:26,041
one where it's explicitly these
emotional columns and.Like we've

767
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,110
drained the emotion out of the
actual things that we're putting

768
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:31,050
under these individual columns.
We're not talking about it in

769
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:36,420
terms of,um,Hey,I'm actually
really glad that this thing

770
00:46:36,425 --> 00:46:40,740
happened.I'm actually,uh,really
upset that this particular thing

771
00:46:40,746 --> 00:46:43,021
happened.I'm mad about this
particular thing,or,I'm really

772
00:46:43,021 --> 00:46:48,150
sad that this,you know,this thing
occurred.Um,and it,it's a

773
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,126
question of like if,um,Agile
methodologies,they'll do like

774
00:46:52,126 --> 00:46:55,516
fist of five.Have you ever heard
of that?Like,um,it's kind of a

775
00:46:55,516 --> 00:46:58,155
confidence thing after you do
your planning where it's like,

776
00:46:58,155 --> 00:47:01,306
how confident are you that you
can actually deliver what's in

777
00:47:01,306 --> 00:47:09,115
the sprint?And what's interesting
to me is that that is a.weird

778
00:47:09,146 --> 00:47:11,815
performative kind of thing.Most
of the time when I've seen it

779
00:47:11,815 --> 00:47:17,186
used,uh,where it's,if you have a,
like,if you have dare to raise a

780
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:21,686
one as like,I'm not sure.Um,it's
like the whole team comes,like

781
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:25,646
the,the whole force of the team
comes to bear on you.This

782
00:47:25,646 --> 00:47:30,096
tremendous normative force to be
like,why are you not conforming?

783
00:47:32,695 --> 00:47:35,126
and suddenly you've got to like,
I mean,and the same thing can be

784
00:47:35,126 --> 00:47:37,525
true even if you're just doing
normal pointing,right?I mean,

785
00:47:37,525 --> 00:47:40,076
like,that's the,the Agile joke is
like,well,everything's a three

786
00:47:40,106 --> 00:47:43,916
because there's this,again,
tremendous normative force to

787
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:48,626
push.if you have something that's
outside where it's a one or you

788
00:47:48,626 --> 00:47:51,835
have a,an eight,or God forbid,
like a13,if you're doing like FE

789
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:56,246
numbers or whatever,um,there's
this tremendous force to be like,

790
00:47:56,246 --> 00:48:02,275
why is that the case and not to.
You know,to recognize that

791
00:48:02,275 --> 00:48:06,356
typically those things mean that
there is an emotion there.If I'm

792
00:48:06,356 --> 00:48:10,286
looking at it as a13,it isn't
just that it's technically

793
00:48:10,585 --> 00:48:13,945
difficult,that could be the case,
but in a lot of cases it's,I'm

794
00:48:13,945 --> 00:48:20,166
scared there's risk here,right?
Or we've tried something like

795
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:23,036
this before in the past and it
didn't work,and I'm afraid that

796
00:48:23,036 --> 00:48:27,775
it might not work again.But we
never frame it in that term and

797
00:48:27,775 --> 00:48:32,740
we should.we should be talking
about.I am scared about this.Why

798
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:36,610
am I scared about this?I'm,you
know,we're in the middle of a,a

799
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:41,320
revamp of,um,some code that is,
uh,let's just say,let's be

800
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:47,920
charitable and say it was hastily
written.Um,there were

801
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,650
externalities that,that has had
to deal

802
00:48:50,831 --> 00:48:52,780
Dan: I just,just call it legacy
code.It'll be fine.

803
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:59,606
Arthur: this.This is the most
legacy code I've ever seen.Um,I

804
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:02,726
mean in,in,in real talk,some of
the ca the code that we are

805
00:49:02,726 --> 00:49:04,195
working with is25years old.

806
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:05,231
Bekah: Wow.

807
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:07,405
Arthur: Um,there are nine
different languages on this

808
00:49:07,405 --> 00:49:15,146
project.Uh,yeah,it's exciting.So
there's a lot of emotions,and we

809
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:17,635
are currently supporting this,
this code that's,I mean,it's in

810
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:23,186
production,it's running,and there
is a lot of emotions around.I am

811
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:25,706
afraid that we're on the hook for
something that we're,you know,

812
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:30,626
code we didn't.and code that we
don't understand,still don't

813
00:49:30,626 --> 00:49:37,465
understand.And being able to
literally say those words that I

814
00:49:37,465 --> 00:49:43,376
am,I am scared of.This,opens the
door to a better understanding

815
00:49:43,376 --> 00:49:48,536
instead of having to,to wrap it
in,um,the trappings of,of

816
00:49:48,536 --> 00:49:52,675
scientific,you know,fake science
basically.Well,I'm worried about,

817
00:49:52,675 --> 00:49:56,201
you know,I mean,even,you know,
words like the externalities that

818
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,931
I used,right?Like we're we wrap
it in terms like that,where it's

819
00:49:58,931 --> 00:50:01,061
like there's a lot of
externalities,this code,there's a

820
00:50:01,061 --> 00:50:03,731
bunch of complexity,there's a
bunch of technical debt.We've

821
00:50:03,731 --> 00:50:06,190
made up words that basically all
mean the same thing,which is

822
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:10,871
like,it,it's a nasty,dark thicket
of code and I'm scared of it,

823
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,061
right?That doesn't mean that
there isn't reason for it,right?

824
00:50:16,061 --> 00:50:22,766
We also dismiss the emotions as
as,as irrational or.Less valuable

825
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:25,766
than a narrative cognitive
explanation,but in,in a lot of

826
00:50:25,766 --> 00:50:28,916
cases,they're equally valuable,
at least in terms of

827
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:31,916
understanding your situation and,
and the human element of it,and

828
00:50:31,916 --> 00:50:35,005
understanding what the next path
forward is.If you're scared of

829
00:50:35,005 --> 00:50:38,545
the thing,you fix that by
understanding it,you fix that by

830
00:50:38,545 --> 00:50:41,456
starting to go through and
figuring out what the replacement

831
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:45,385
is,what the path forward is.
Right?I mean,going back to the,

832
00:50:45,385 --> 00:50:50,590
the human behavioral health side
of things,right?There's the.The

833
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:57,190
idiom that,um,anxiety lives in
uncertainty and the more you can

834
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:00,521
be certain about something,the
less fear room there is for fear

835
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:01,331
in that environment.

836
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:06,101
Dan: Yeah,absolutely.I,I've had
the experience many times and we,

837
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:11,425
we,uh,Oh,just today it went out.
Um,with,with Kai,we,we talked

838
00:51:11,425 --> 00:51:14,726
about that.Uh,I've,like me
personally,I've had this

839
00:51:14,726 --> 00:51:16,766
experience of just avoiding
things that I should learn or

840
00:51:16,766 --> 00:51:20,815
should do just because it was.A
big ball of unknown,you know?And

841
00:51:20,815 --> 00:51:23,846
my brain had,my brain was just
like,no,run away from this.You

842
00:51:23,846 --> 00:51:26,186
don't know anything.Like,you
don't understand it.It's like

843
00:51:26,215 --> 00:51:28,735
it's,you know,it's,it's like
that,it's exactly the dark

844
00:51:28,735 --> 00:51:31,916
thicket,you know,like,I'm just
gonna skirt around this,this

845
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:35,335
instead of diving in,you know?
Um,but I guess to extend the

846
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:38,065
metaphor,right?Get a flashlight
and a me a compass and,

847
00:51:38,626 --> 00:51:39,456
Arthur: Or a machete.

848
00:51:39,956 --> 00:51:42,865
Dan: Or a machete.Yeah,yeah,
yeah,yeah.Exactly.Uh,one way or

849
00:51:42,865 --> 00:51:45,655
the other.Figure out how to,how
to,how to get through it,you

850
00:51:45,655 --> 00:51:47,376
know?Uh,yeah.I.

851
00:51:49,001 --> 00:51:52,481
Bekah: Well,Arthur,I wanna say
we're,um,at about time and I

852
00:51:52,481 --> 00:51:55,840
wanna thank you so much for
chatting with us today.I know

853
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,150
that these are,this one of those
conversations that I could have

854
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:02,050
had for probably another three
hours and found so much value.

855
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:06,280
So,first of all,I wanna know when
your book is coming out because I

856
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,990
wanna read it and I would love to
see you put something out there

857
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:11,501
like that.

858
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:14,590
Arthur: I probably should at some
point.I'm actually working on a

859
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:19,121
course for,um,folks at work that
want to get into speaking and I'm

860
00:52:19,121 --> 00:52:22,061
up to like98pages,so I don't
think I'm accidentally writing a

861
00:52:22,061 --> 00:52:27,010
book about that.Um,so we'll see
if that happens,but if it does,

862
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:27,920
maybe there will be another one.

863
00:52:28,856 --> 00:52:32,846
Bekah: That would be amazing.Uh,
and I'm gonna end with our last

864
00:52:32,846 --> 00:52:36,655
question,which is,what is one
word you would use to describe

865
00:52:36,655 --> 00:52:37,135
yourself?

866
00:52:38,456 --> 00:52:43,826
Arthur: I think my one word is
idiosyncratic.Um,I love that word

867
00:52:43,826 --> 00:52:47,726
because I think it describes like
it is just about being slightly

868
00:52:47,726 --> 00:52:51,565
different,about approaching
things a different way,about,um,

869
00:52:51,686 --> 00:52:54,746
not being what you would expect,
and that I feel like that

870
00:52:54,746 --> 00:52:56,606
summarizes a lot of my life.

871
00:52:58,525 --> 00:52:59,005
Dan: Pull up that.

872
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:02,021
Bekah: Yeah.I appreciate that.I
think it,it,that's a really nice

873
00:53:02,021 --> 00:53:07,661
way to.Word to pair up with the
concentric circles in the journey

874
00:53:07,661 --> 00:53:09,731
that you're talking about,
because it is that different

875
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:13,240
perspective.So thank you so much
for sharing that with us and for

876
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,311
sharing the time with us on the
podcast today.

877
00:53:15,806 --> 00:53:16,945
Arthur: Thanks very much for
having me.

878
00:53:17,425 --> 00:53:19,496
Dan: Yeah.Thank you Arthur.We'll
see you.Uh,see you soon.

879
00:53:19,976 --> 00:53:20,456
