00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,829
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to season 1, episode

2
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:23,160
6 of the Virtual Coffee
podcast. I'm Bekah, and this is

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,100
a podcast that features members
of the Virtual Coffee community.

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,820
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,850
stages of their coding journey.
And they're here on this podcast

6
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,030
sharing their stories and what
they've learned. And we're here

7
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,990
to share it with you. Here with
me today is my co-host, Dan.

8
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,759
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. In this
episode, you'll hear from Drew

9
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,539
Clements. Drew is a career
transitioner, a father of two

10
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,109
and full time developer. And he
spends his spare time building

11
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,799
protege.dev and hopes to become
a strong advocate for junior

12
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,130
developers everywhere. In this
episode, we talk about building

13
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,939
a career and also Drew's
experience building protege.dev

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,290
the platform curated with remote
jobs for junior developers. Drew

15
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,560
talks about the struggles of
junior level job searching, the

16
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,140
importance of supportive company
culture, and learning and

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,489
public, while building Protege.

18
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,340
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We start
every episode of the podcast

19
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,700
like we start every Virtual
Coffee. We introduce ourselves

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,939
with our name, where we're from,
what we do, and a random

21
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,079
check-in question. Today's
question is, what is the most

22
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,909
beautiful place near where you
live? We hope you enjoyed this

23
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:44,819
episode.
Hey, I'm Bekah, I'm a front end

24
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:49,140
developer from a small town in
Ohio and the most beautiful

25
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:53,040
place near me, I don't really
know. But it snowed a lot last

26
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,950
night. And so all of the pine
trees look really, really

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,170
beautiful. So I'm just gonna go
with pine trees covered with

28
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,170
snow.

29
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,930
Dan Ott: That's awesome. I love
how everything looks with snow

30
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,670
on it. Hi, I'm Dan. I am a
front end developer from

31
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,370
Cleveland, Ohio. I say Cleveland
every time I'm actually from

32
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:14,439
Lakewood, which is first city, West
of Cleveland. And so there is a

33
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:18,849
park called Lakewood Park that's
on the lake here. And it's very

34
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:21,400
beautiful. There's lots of,
it's big, and there's lots of

35
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,789
cool little spots to hang out.
So that's that.

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,449
Drew Clements: I'm Drew. I'm a
front end developer with Foster

37
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:36,750
Commerce. The most beautiful
place near where I live. I live

38
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,270
in the south. So my options are
limited here. So I'm like five

39
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,849
minutes from St. Simons Island.
But the beaches aren't

40
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:48,659
necessarily pretty. They just
have expensive resorts. And I'm

41
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:51,599
like, I'm just out to Savannah.
So they have a pretty rad

42
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,610
downtown. But okay, I got one. I
got one. On the other side of the

43
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,180
state from me, which is still
relatively close compared to you

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,500
guys. We have, they call it the
little Grand Canyon. It's a

45
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,349
little hiking trail. It really
does just look like a miniature

46
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,400
version of the Grand Canyon.

47
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,500
Dan Ott: Nice. That's cool. That
sounds cool. Yeah.

48
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,210
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Vacation
2021. Well, welcome, Drew, we

49
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,370
are very happy to have you and
fun fact about Drew, he designed

50
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,310
the Virtual Coffee logo. So
thanks for that.

51
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,680
Drew Clements: I do what I can.
(laugh)

52
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,819
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We always
like to start off with the

53
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:34,530
origin story of how you got into
tech. So can you give us a

54
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,129
little background?

55
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:41,000
Drew Clements: Yeah, that's, I
feel like my story into tech is

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,030
like a story linked to a story
linked to a story. So growing

57
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,719
up, I played in bunch of punk
rock bands. One of the last

58
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,770
bands I played in, I met a guy
from the local music scene named

59
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,729
Sean. Sean moved away to
California and became a

60
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:05,360
developer. Right before he did
that, I tattooed him. Me tattooing

61
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:10,400
landed me in apprenticeship as
a designer a few years later,

62
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,889
which then let me, that's where I
was kind of introduced to like

63
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:20,720
HTML and CSS. So I was like,
hey, I'm learning this stuff. I

64
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,819
remember Shawn was doing
something like this. So then I

65
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:25,250
reached back out to him. Me and
him started kind of talking

66
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:32,300
again. So from there, I was able
to kind of work into a developer

67
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:40,040
role with that same company. And
left tattooing. So it's, it's a

68
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,300
guy I met through the local
music scene in 2010 ended up

69
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,879
getting me into developing a
decade later. Yeah, so I spent

70
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,329
seven years as a tattoo artist,
transitioned to graphic design.

71
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:56,779
From graphic design, I used to
know that Sean, the old

72
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:02,930
connection, to get my way here.
And I don't think I could have

73
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,420
made that happen if I had all
the money in the world and 10

74
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,160
years to plan it, but here I am.

75
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,939
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That's
awesome. So if we ever have a

76
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:14,300
Virtual Coffee on-site
conference, are you going to

77
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,360
offer tattoos? All Virtual
Coffee logos?

78
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,300
Drew Clements: (laugh) Yes,
I will do that.

79
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,579
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: All right,
we have it recorded. So now you

80
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:29,300
can't back out. Okay, so I'm
also want to know about how you

81
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,939
found Virtual Coffee. I feel
like I have known you longer, a

82
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:38,990
lot longer than Virtual Coffee
has been going on. So. But how

83
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,850
did you end up at Virtual Coffee?

84
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,459
Drew Clements: How did I end up
with Virtual Coffee? It's funny

85
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,370
enough that we're recording this
on a podcast because I met you

86
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,879
through reaching out to find
people to interview for a

87
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,740
podcast I was going to start.
So, so I have the recording

88
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,720
actually. I don't know if it, I
don't know if it ever got

89
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,000
editing. I don't (laugh). I just had it right here on the
desk. No. So, I guess in 2019, I was going to start a

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,339
podcast, I reached out to you. We
connected on Twitter. That never

91
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:14,939
ended up happening. But we, when

92
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:18,420
I saw you posting, so at the
beginning of 2020, I was, I was

93
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:20,939
working two jobs. I was working
full time as a designer, part-time

94
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,550
as a developer. An
awesome, both of those job

95
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:27,839
within like 24 hours of each
other. And with a wife that was

96
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:31,800
five months pregnant,
that was kind of like a gut

97
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:35,639
check. But around that same time
was when you'd posted about

98
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:39,329
Virtual Coffee. So like, you
know, I have a lot of spare time

99
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,699
on my hands, Bekah posts a lot
of awesome stuff, we had a great

100
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:46,649
conversation when we recorded
our podcast episode together. So

101
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:51,689
I was like, yeah, let me, let me
check this out and see what

102
00:06:46,649 --> 00:07:01,800
happens. And now you can't get
rid of me. (laugh)

103
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,850
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think that podcast
episode that I recorded with you, I had just

104
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:09,029
been working with Dan for a
couple of months. And I like was

105
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:11,550
still trying to wrap my head
around things. And I remember

106
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:14,160
you asking me questions and I were
like, I don't even know the

107
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,259
words that I should use to
answer those questions. So... (laugh)

108
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,100
Drew Clements: If it's any
consolation, there's still a lot

109
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,709
of times I don't know the words
I should use to answer questions. (laugh)

110
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,449
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah,
that's for sure. Same.

111
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:29,100
Same. (laugh) But it was. It was
like, it was really great podcast

112
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,649
interview because you're just
some fun to be around, I guess.

113
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:39,300
So, I'm happy that you are here
with us today. And at Virtual

114
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:39,810
Coffee.

115
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,199
Drew Clements: Happy to be here.
Like I said you can't get rid of

116
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:43,379
me.

117
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:50,040
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: (laugh) Um, okay,
so fast forward a little bit,

118
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,660
you got another job, your career
changer. And you're like, oh hey,

119
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:01,139
I bought this domain called
protege.dev. So on top of all of

120
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,069
the other things that I'm doing,
I'm, I'm gonna start this

121
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,230
community building project. So,
why and how?

122
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,949
Drew Clements: Why and how?
Well, so, I originally bought the

123
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:19,720
Protege domain... To the back up just
a little bit. I had an old side

124
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,290
project called ColtXP. It's a
really bad name. Never name

125
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,800
anything that ever. But that's
what the original podcast that I

126
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,339
interviewed you for, was going
to kind of be in parallel with

127
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:36,789
that. And so I, I knew that it
was a bad name. So I was trying

128
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,570
to think of something, something
else I could call it. The idea of

129
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,840
that project was that it was
gonna be pretty much a place

130
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,429
where people could connect to
work on open source issues

131
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:51,730
together, kind of like a junior
finding a senior willing to, you

132
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,110
know, give them some time. So I
was just trying to think the,

133
00:08:56,139 --> 00:09:01,929
the name ColtXP, uhm... I think
I just used like a Thesaurus or

134
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:04,539
something like, what's another
word for someone that's learning

135
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:08,259
something or something like
that. And Colt was somehow on

136
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:10,539
that list. It was like an
inexperienced person or

137
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:15,190
something like that. Again,
horrible name. Don't ever call

138
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:21,909
anything yet. So I came across
the word protege, you know,

139
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,210
pretty obvious. I don't know why
I didn't think of it in the

140
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:29,230
first place. So I was looking
around on different domains.

141
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:32,139
Actually, no. I went to Netlify.
And I was like, let me see if

142
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,769
protege.com is available.
Obviously, it wasn't. So I was

143
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:39,580
like, let me see if protege.dev
is available. It was. For 15

144
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,590
bucks. I was like that's not bad
at all. So I hit the next button

145
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,460
expecting there to be like
insert payment information. And

146
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:54,970
it said, congratulations. I was
like uh... okay. I guess this is a

147
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,799
thing now. So I kind of went
back and forth on do I want to

148
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,669
make that something new with
that name, do I want to rebrand

149
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:09,399
the old project under Protege,
which was the original idea. But

150
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,669
then, but then COVID happened,
and I lost, I lost both of those

151
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:18,340
jobs. So I think, I think I
accidentally bought the domain

152
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:24,970
in February and then in March
was when I lost work. So, you

153
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,039
know, I was looking, I lost
work, so I was looking at all

154
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,470
the job boards all the time.
And it was, you know, you see

155
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,700
senior, senior, senior lead,
tech lead, bla bla bla bla. And

156
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,700
I was like, there's like,
there's nothing, it's so

157
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,360
hard to find anything for
someone at my skill level. So I

158
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,370
was like, you know what? I'm
just gonna build the job board

159
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,980
that I wish I had. And that's,
that's kind of how it ended up

160
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,710
getting started. I lost, I lost
my job and gave myself a new

161
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,159
one (laugh). A new one that
doesn't pay anything.

162
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,169
Dan Ott: I love that, I love the
idea of like, you just, you have

163
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:05,669
a problem, you know, and so you
just decided to fix it (laugh),

164
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:07,529
to fix it yourself, right?

165
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:09,239
Drew Clements: That's, that's
pretty much what happened.

166
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,568
Dan Ott: Yeah, it's amazing. And
then on top of that, you know,

167
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,639
you know you're going to gain
experience for yourself, you

168
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,308
know? And building it, right? We
were just talking to Vic. And

169
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:23,458
he's talking about a lot of this
sort of the same thing, right?

170
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,519
Like the, he frames it a little
differently. But the indie, you

171
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,418
know, indie hacking mentality,
right? Of, you have a problem.

172
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:34,019
And so instead of, I don't know,
wandering around, or just being

173
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,288
sad, you know, right? Like, you
just kind of go and, go and dive

174
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:41,788
into it, right? And hopefully,
it becomes a successful product.

175
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:44,609
And also, you know, you're
giving yourself like, experience

176
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:46,828
and scratching your own itch and
all that stuff. That's great.

177
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,549
Drew Clements: Yeah, the, when I
first started out on Protege, my

178
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:55,110
mindset was, you know, I'm going
to build this thing in React, I

179
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,429
need, I needed a React project
on my portfolio. So I told

180
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:03,120
myself, like, I'm gonna, I'm
gonna build this out. And if it

181
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,860
works, awesome. If not, then I
have something on a resume that

182
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,460
will maybe at least helped get
me hired, which it actually did,

183
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,129
fairly, fairly early on. So I
think I started building it in

184
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:19,440
March. And either at the end of
March or early April, I was

185
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,250
connected with a company called
Layer Frame out of Florida,

186
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,740
super awesome team. And the
workout done on Protege, even at

187
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,450
that point, before it was even
done. Just the fact that I was

188
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:36,870
doing that, you know, building
that product, but also the work

189
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:43,799
I'd put into it myself, pretty
much jumping in blind was one of,

190
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,529
one of the reasons that they
can even consider to bring me on

191
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:50,399
the team. So it saved me almost
immediately.

192
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,669
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think
that's so great. I think there's

193
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,919
a tendency when you are starting
out as an entry level dev to

194
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,620
just keep going through the
tutorials, right? And there's

195
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,039
nothing wrong with that. But
there's so many different people

196
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,399
that are doing those same
projects. So if you're able to

197
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,309
do something where you're
building something that you're

198
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:14,279
interested in, or something that
solves a problem for you, you're

199
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,490
a little bit invested in it, but
it also shows that, hey, look,

200
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,360
you know, I tackled this
problem, and I kept adding to it

201
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,259
and growing with it. And I think
that really shows, you know, a

202
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:28,049
really good representation of
who you are as a coder.

203
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,110
Dan Ott: Yeah, you mentioned
like, when you were describing

204
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,159
talking to the company who hired
you after that, that you went into

205
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,970
the, the Protege project going
in blind. And I was, I was

206
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,360
wondering, like, what you like,
in hindsight, like, what do you

207
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,879
think of when you say that,
like, what pieces were you

208
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,659
missing, you know? Now that
you've gone through the whole

209
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:56,019
process, and it's been a
product, you know, for however

210
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:58,929
long, I just looked at my watch
to see what month it was. I don't know

211
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:01,659
what I'm doing. But, you know,
it's, it's been a, you know, it's

212
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:03,789
been live for how many months?

213
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:05,440
Drew Clements: Coming up on a
year. I think March will be a year.

214
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,049
Dan Ott: Okay, yeah. So I guess
my question is (laugh), my

215
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:13,299
question is like, what, what do
you know, now that like, would

216
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:16,240
change your approach, if
anything, you know? If you would

217
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,210
start, if you were starting
protege.dev right now?

218
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:24,940
Drew Clements: How much time do you
have? (laugh) It was, so, the initial

219
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,679
build was just a regular Create
React App. That was intentional,

220
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,110
because I wanted to force myself
to learn some of the lower level

221
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:40,419
plumbing. I wish I would have
known more about state

222
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:45,850
management in React. Like I
kinda... So, right before this

223
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,710
episode, we were talking about
how some of the, some of the

224
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,370
parts of it are really just a
juggling act until, you know, it

225
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:58,419
either dies or does what it's
supposed to do. So I think, if I

226
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,370
would have known a little bit
more around that, that could

227
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:05,080
have been, I don't think it's an
unstable system. But it's not as

228
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,840
good as it can be. And I'm
actually in the process of

229
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:14,110
rewriting some of that work now.
And I expect I'm going to be

230
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,250
able to eliminate probably about
40% of what's there now, and

231
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,539
have something that works
better in, you know, with better

232
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:26,830
practices in place at the same
time. Also I didn't really know

233
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:31,539
much about, like component
systems, like I knew what components

234
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:35,200
were, but I didn't really have a
good idea of how to utilize them

235
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,539
correctly, which is another
thing I've been kind of cleaning

236
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:40,779
up as I've been doing this
rebuild. We're converting from

237
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:47,080
React, Create React App to Next
right now. So I mean, even just

238
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,149
last night, I was looking at
some stuff like why didn't I

239
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,299
just make this a component
rather than pasting it seven

240
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:57,519
times in the same place? Yeah.
So, just, just little stuff like

241
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:57,909
that.

242
00:15:58,678 --> 00:16:00,568
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: It's
interesting. I used to write

243
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:03,989
screenplays with my brother. And
one of the first bits of advice

244
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:07,828
someone told me or I heard, it
was write your whole screenplay,

245
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:11,818
and then cut 50% and then
rewrite it. And like, as you're

246
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:15,629
talking through this, that kind
of makes sense to me in terms of

247
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:18,778
like, okay, you have something
down and you learned a lot in

248
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:22,078
that first process. But what you
learn should enable you to

249
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:25,469
really tighten things up and
getting it working efficiently

250
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:28,649
or, or making it an effective
story and codes not that

251
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:29,548
different from that.

252
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,039
Drew Clements: Yeah, that was
what Andy's, the co-founder, he

253
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:38,059
came on really early on with me.
One, one thing we were very

254
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:41,299
adamant about when we were
starting up was that we're going

255
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:48,470
to try to build as much of this
as possible without a library,

256
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,129
if we can. So that's why,
that's why a lot of the state

257
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:55,009
management with some of the
forms are a bit of a juggling

258
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:57,919
act, because we knew there was,
you know, Redux and other things

259
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,570
like that out there. But we
wanted to kind of put ourselves

260
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,619
in the uncomfortable position
of having to build it, the only

261
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,670
having to build it with whatever
we had available to us then,

262
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:16,670
without grabbing something off 
the shelf. And... I mean, he would

263
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,900
probably agree, we both probably,
we learned, we learned

264
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,950
a lot of wrong ways to handle
state React. We learned a

265
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,890
lot of ways that you can do it,
but probably aren't ideal. And

266
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:34,160
now we're, now we're getting into
the phase of, you know, now, now

267
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,440
we can do it the right way with
an understanding of why it's the

268
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:36,950
right way.

269
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:43,109
Dan Ott: Yeah, that enable that,
that agreement at the beginning,

270
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,319
and between you and your partner
was is like, a very, very cool

271
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,500
thing to do. Especially, you
know, it's nice to have

272
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,910
alignment and that sort of thing,
you know? But I mean, I always,

273
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,180
always, always say the best way
to learn anything, on any sort

274
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,970
of deep level is to do it, just
like you guys have done. And

275
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,509
state management in particular, I
mean like, a lot of things are like

276
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:06,930
this. But state management is one
of those, where there's a million

277
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:12,750
ways to do it. None of them are
right or wrong, really. And the,

278
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,559
but you never really, you never
gonna have actual full insight

279
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,160
into why you, why to make one
choice or the other. Why to use

280
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,890
Redux versus, you know, anything
else. It, by reading tutorials,

281
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,900
you're never gonna figure it
out, right? Like, you're never

282
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,779
like, somebody could say use
Redux for this x, y and z, you

283
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:34,769
know? Don't use Redux here, you
know, and you could sort of try

284
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:37,859
to follow them. But you're never
gonna, you don't understand why

285
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,480
until you've gone down the road
of hacking it together, and then

286
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,180
getting to the spot where you're
like, okay, this, I see now.

287
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,609
Like, this is not working out,
or this is like more of a pain

288
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:50,400
than it should be, or, you know,
or whatever. Or I don't trust it

289
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,180
as much, which is, which is one
of the, like, one of the, one of

290
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,269
the things that's hard to
explain until you feel it,

291
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,730
right? So you have that, you're
talking about that form state.

292
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,900
And just not like, you know, it
can be better, you know, like,

293
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,180
it's working and stuff, but you
know, like, there's some,

294
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,720
there's some area where it's not
exactly sure what's going on or

295
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,930
can't track, you know, all the
different pieces of state or all

296
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,829
the different, you know, figures (??)
that go on. Like, that's really

297
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:17,190
great.

298
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,410
Drew Clements: Yeah, and even
when we're, even while I'm coming

299
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:26,880
through it now, I'm realizing,
I'm kind of reflecting back on

300
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,549
where I was last year, and like
I can kind of like see the

301
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:33,599
growth that I've had over the
last year. It's like, as I'm, as I

302
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,150
rebuilding part to this, I'm
looking at, I'm looking at some

303
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,940
of the state and I'm like, okay,
this, this definitely needs to

304
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,849
be, you know, handled somewhere
else in a more safer way. But

305
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,779
this is actually perfectly fine
to just be, you know, in this

306
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:50,039
one component, and that's all it
needs. And it's... I don't know. I,

307
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:54,569
me a year ago would be like
so jealous of me right now (laugh),

308
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:59,400
that I'm like able to set
them in a position to like to

309
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,890
know the difference of one
and why.

310
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:03,630
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think
that's a really good point too,

311
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,019
because there's always this
tricky thing where you feel

312
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:10,380
like, oh, I have not, I haven't
grown enough. But look, you're

313
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,349
talking about this one year
journey and how much you've

314
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:15,569
learned, you know? You've grown
a lot through that. And

315
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:19,079
sometimes it feels very slow.
But really, you're, you're

316
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:19,950
moving a ton.

317
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,160
Drew Clements: Yeah, and this is
actually my, this is my first

318
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,890
year as a full time developer. So
before this, I was either, um... I

319
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,380
was working part time, which
was, you know, like, maybe 15

320
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,289
hours after I got done with a
full time job. So like, you

321
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:38,049
know, I was already probably
coming in at, like, 60% mental (??)

322
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:45,940
capacity. And then the job I
had in the agency before that,

323
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,750
it was a developer role, but it
was, it was with a bunch of

324
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,950
proprietary stuff, and some
older languages. So like, a lot

325
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,279
of it didn't really... So I mean,
a lot of it was just customer

326
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:03,190
support to begin with. And the
smaller majority after that was,

327
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:09,039
you know, it was in, in such a
sandboxed and specific place

328
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,170
that a lot of it couldn't really
translate over. What I, one

329
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,420
thing I wanted to double back
on you said there, the, the

330
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,829
alignment between me and Andy, a
lot of that was able to happen

331
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:25,569
was because, I mean, I was, I was
very junior when I just decided

332
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:30,400
to go full tilt on this, but
Andy was the same way. Andy

333
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,549
was working full time as a
project manager, you know. He

334
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:35,619
had written some code before, I
don't know the full extent of

335
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:40,750
his, of his experience before
that. But when he approached me,

336
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,150
he was like, hey, I've had a
similar idea. I'm kind of in the

337
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:48,339
same spot. So when, when we were
kind of like spitballing ideas,

338
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:51,730
we were like, you know, let's
keep it simple, check. Let's

339
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,450
build as much as we can without
libraries, check. So I think, I

340
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,500
think part of the reason we were
able to align on so many things

341
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,609
in the beginning is that we
were, for the most part in

342
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:09,400
pretty much the exact same spot,
career wise. Shout out to Andy,

343
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,950
by the way. He just started full
time as a developer, I think,

344
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,250
within the last few weeks. So
congrats on that.

345
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:16,259
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, for
sure.

346
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:17,009
Dan Ott: Congrats to Andy.

347
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:25,529
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Andy is
also very awesome. Okay, so

348
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:29,250
simultaneously, you are
establishing a career as an

349
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:34,259
early career developer, and you
are tackling a big problem in

350
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:37,710
the industry, right? So can we
talk a little bit about the

351
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:38,430
challenges of balancing both
of those things?

352
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:44,029
Drew Clements: Um, I don't know
if there's a balance as much as

353
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:50,779
I just put as much weight on both
all the time (laugh). Which is why

354
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:55,069
I'm probably on like, a beeline to
burnout at some point (laugh). I

355
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:58,849
don't know. It's, I don't know,
I haven't really thought about

356
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:01,819
it. There's not much for
balance. Or I guess I don't

357
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:06,349
really have a process for
balancing it. So like, I'm

358
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:09,289
really bad about saying yes
when people ask me for stuff. So

359
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:14,089
like, I joined up with Layer
Frame. And then, thanks to a

360
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:17,089
tweet that you sent out Bekah, I
was propositioned for some other

361
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:20,809
contract work that ended up
happening like right alongside

362
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:25,700
that. That turned into the full
time role that I have now. So

363
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,730
I'm like, okay, cool. I won't
have two jobs anymore. Like a

364
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,819
month after that someone else was
like, hey, I got some contract,

365
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:34,819
or do you want to jump in on? I'm
like, absolutely (laugh). Let's do it.

366
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:42,289
So. I've had a bad habit of
keeping two jobs.

367
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:45,089
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah. It's so
hard to balance. I'm not, I'm

368
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:47,430
certainly not good at that
either. And that's one of the

369
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,549
things that I'm working at
figuring out I like go through

370
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:54,900
these cycles. I'm like, all in
for six weeks. And then for an

371
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,950
entire week I feel like I can't
move. And that's obviously not

372
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,279
healthy (laugh). I'm trying to find
better ways of doing that. But

373
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:05,069
also, there's just this weird, I
don't know, tech just move so

374
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:09,809
fast all the time. And you want
to level up as a new developer.

375
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:15,690
And at the same time, you're so
aware of the problems of, I don't

376
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,819
know, like being an entry level
developer position that you want

377
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:24,539
to tackle them when you have
that passion. So there is this

378
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:32,910
weird, you know, how do I do all
of these things and still take

379
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,079
care of myself.

380
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:36,579
Drew Clements: That's, that's
one thing I've planned to focus

381
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:40,450
on this year is getting the
stuff done that I want to in a

382
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:45,190
healthy way. I will say one
silver lining to taking on all

383
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,849
that extra contract work is I've,
I've walked away with probably

384
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:52,299
at least two to three things
that I didn't know before I

385
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:58,720
started the project. I really
forget where that sentence was

386
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,329
going (laugh). That was gonna
be a good one too.

387
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:04,000
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: (laugh)
And that's we, all the time.

388
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:04,900
Dan Ott: Yes.

389
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:09,190
Drew Clements: Oh, no, so, it allowed,
it allowed me to work with a couple

390
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:12,069
of different or, you know, just
developers with different

391
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:14,740
styles. So when I was with Layer
Frame, I was working with Rob.

392
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:20,710
And I feel like Rob was just
like a mastermind with

393
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,250
everything. So like, anytime I
had a, anytime I had a problem,

394
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,460
he had a solution for it. And he
was really good at walking me

395
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,500
through how he got to the
solution. So I walked away with

396
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,420
some really good troubleshooting
skills from that.

397
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,539
And then when I, on this last
contract role that I just, at the

398
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,819
end of last year, I was working
with a guy named Nick.

399
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,759
And he's just, he's just super
knowledgeable around React. And

400
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,569
like, some of, there's like so
many tools and methods in React

401
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:53,500
that I didn't even know were a
thing until I was able to work

402
00:25:53,500 --> 00:26:01,869
with him. So it, I overload
myself a lot, but so far, I've

403
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:05,440
walked away, I've walked away
in the green from it.

404
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,369
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I want to
come back to this idea of

405
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:13,960
talking about Rob and one, just
like learning in general. So, do

406
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,849
you have a measure or a point
where you think, okay, I have

407
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:22,599
been trying to figure out this
problem. And I know that this

408
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:25,480
other person knows the answer.
So at what point do you ask?

409
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,230
Like, how far down the rabbit
hole do you go before you ask

410
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:29,680
for help?

411
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:36,779
Drew Clements: So at my full
time job, we have a one hour

412
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:40,410
rule, if you get stuck for more
than an hour, then reach out to

413
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:45,089
someone. And I think that's kind
of been rubbing off on me, for

414
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:49,470
my side projects. I'm in a
couple of different communities,

415
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,609
that I kind of know which one
will probably more than likely

416
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:57,119
have the answers I need, or will
be, dependent on the time of day,

417
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:03,210
may just be more available. So I
usually try to hit it. If, you

418
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,569
know, right at the one hour
mark, depending on how hard I'm

419
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:09,359
spinning my wheels. Some,
sometimes, I know there's been a

420
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,049
few times, like I just, I hit a
wall and like I don't even know

421
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:15,450
how to start scaling this thing.
So I'm just gonna immediately

422
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,000
reach out, but then there's
sometimes like, you know, I go

423
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,720
through, I go through my
troubleshooting process. And if

424
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,339
I still can't really get
anywhere, I have a couple

425
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:29,849
different places I can reach out
to the... What I love about the

426
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:33,869
communities that I'm in is that
in most cases, it's rare that

427
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:37,380
they're just gonna give me the
answer, but they're more so

428
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,069
going to work through it with
me, and almost kind of rubber

429
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:45,029
duck me to the answer. So that's
always super awesome.

430
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:51,299
Dan Ott: Nice. Yeah. Like, I
mean, that one hour mark? Seems

431
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:54,539
like a good, like rule of thumb,
you know, for that sort of

432
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:58,529
thing. That question comes up a
lot, you know, and with, with

433
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:05,009
newer, early career developers,
you know, I mean, that exact

434
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:06,960
question comes up a lot. A lot
of people are wondering it, and

435
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,480
it's hard to sort of baseline
it. I feel like the answer can

436
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:15,480
sometimes change depending on
the company, if you're, I mean,

437
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,640
if you're working like this is
not for side projects, but you

438
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,549
know, at a job. And I've been
finding it very, like, it seems

439
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:27,000
like a good thing to have an
actual rule for, like you said,

440
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:30,599
that, that's where you learned
it from, have it written down,

441
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:34,349
you know, and make it make sure
it's okay for early career

442
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:37,019
developers to ask questions, you
know? And like, let them know

443
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:40,410
when to do it, right? Because
you know what? I mean, nobody

444
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,200
wants to ask a question right
away every time they don't know

445
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,349
anything, you know, but it
always is going to be like,

446
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,079
like, doing the rubber ducky
thing is just like such a useful

447
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,009
tool for any developer of any,
any skill or you know, learning

448
00:28:56,009 --> 00:29:01,200
level. It just that one hour mark
seems, seems cool. I don't know.

449
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,470
Drew Clements: Yeah. Speaking of
rubber ducks, my, we did uh... Two

450
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,650
years ago, we did Secret Santa
for the family. My sister got

451
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,190
me, she didn't know what, she
didn't know what to get me. So

452
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:17,819
she just googled like, coder
gift ideas. And she got me this.

453
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,890
It says, it says, Hi!
I'm Stu, your debugging friend.

454
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:26,970
Tell me your steps and we'll
find the bug together! It's, it's

455
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,710
right here on my desk. And he
does exactly that.

456
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,019
Dan Ott: That's amazing.

457
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:36,059
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I um, I have
a problem of, I think, early in

458
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:39,599
my career. It was I don't know
if I should ask a question. And

459
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:43,680
now that I'm a little bit in,
it's the stubbornness in me that

460
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,309
I have to tackle like, I can do
this, you know? (laugh) Like, I don't

461
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:51,119
have to ask a question. This is a real
check of, I don't know, what does

462
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,710
that like hubris or something? (laugh)

463
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:59,230
Drew Clements: (laugh) Yeah. No, I
have uh... The first kind of developer

464
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:04,240
role I was in, the senior dev I
worked with, he was, he was very

465
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,119
much trained the old-school way
and brought up with the

466
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:12,099
old-school mentality. So any,
anytime I would come to

467
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:15,190
questions with him, he would
assume that like, I got to the

468
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,190
question, or I got to the
problem and immediately ask the

469
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,210
question. And that's kind of how
he would react to me. Like,

470
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,019
there's a lot of tension there.
Like it got to the point where I

471
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:29,920
didn't want to ask him a
question, because I knew what, I

472
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,819
knew the vibe and what the
response was going to be. What

473
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:36,579
was actually happening is like,
I was spinning my wheels for

474
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:41,170
like, two hours trying to not
have to ask him a question. And

475
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,259
then when I did ask the
question, it was like, you know,

476
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:50,319
grief conflict? A whole bunch of
tension. So it's, I don't know,

477
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:55,900
it's, it's been like a breath of
fresh air, slash a huge relief that,

478
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:01,119
A, I've found the communities
that have found and have places

479
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:05,349
that I can ask questions, but B,
now with a company that like,

480
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,859
that had, that has their own
rule for when you should ask

481
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:12,700
questions, and a lot of times,
they're, they're gonna chop that

482
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,490
hour down to like, 30 minutes,
or like, any time I'm on a

483
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:19,390
project, they're like, hey, one hour
rule is actually 10 minutes here,

484
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,730
when our rules actually 20
minutes here, and they actually

485
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:25,119
want you to ask questions they
have, we have an entire thread (??)

486
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:27,819
in basecamp, where it's just
different developers asking

487
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:31,509
different questions. And
there's, it's just super awesome

488
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:32,380
thing to be a part of.

489
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,750
Dan Ott: That's really, that's
cool. That's really cool to

490
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:38,259
hear. Like the per project or
something, they'll, they'll just

491
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:40,359
say, okay, for this project, we
know it's like new or something,

492
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:43,420
or a lot of moving pieces. So change
the rule, you know? Based on that.

493
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:45,930
Drew Clements: Yeah. And they,
they're, they're really aware of

494
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:50,910
like, skill level and expertise
with the different, with

495
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:55,170
different tools and stuff. So if
they're bringing me on to a

496
00:31:55,170 --> 00:32:00,779
project that uses you know, like
a legacy build that they know, I

497
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:03,539
haven't really seen a whole lot,
then, then that's when they'll

498
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:08,730
say, hey, your, your windows 15
minutes for this, or if they're

499
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,059
moving, in some cases, even some
of the more experienced devs on

500
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:15,509
to something where it's a little
more intricate UI work, where

501
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:18,630
they're mostly, you know, data
backend stuff like, hey, okay,

502
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:22,589
well, now your windows 10
minutes, and met, but mine will

503
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:25,619
still be the full hour so that
they're, they're really aware of

504
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:29,970
like where everyone's at? And
like, adjusting their windows

505
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,539
accordingly.

506
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,380
Dan Ott: That's really cool
to hear. I feel like asking

507
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,369
questions is almost a skill to
learn as well. Sort of similar

508
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:42,960
to googling (laugh) is a skill as
a developer, you know? It sounds,

509
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,890
everybody who is been a
developer for long enough knows

510
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,230
what that means, like, knows
what a person means when they

511
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,509
say that googling is a skill,
and you have to learn how to

512
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:55,380
google. Do you feel like you
have become better at asking

513
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,130
questions? Once like, especially
once you start working with

514
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,430
maybe a company that value that,
you know, value that

515
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,630
interaction?

516
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,529
Drew Clements: Yeah, absolutely.
And, and I would even say, I got

517
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,440
better at asking questions, even
while I was in that environment.

518
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:18,150
Because uh... Well first, I want to
say, like me and that developer,

519
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,359
we, it was a really strange
relationship. Like, every, every

520
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:27,269
Friday, we would go grab lunch
together, we were best buds. And

521
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:31,140
we liked the same music. We were
both guitarist, and we would sit,

522
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,549
we would sit there, you know, we
shared an office. It feels weird

523
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:39,900
to say that I shared a room with anyone
right now (laugh). But you know, the

524
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,819
entire day, we would just sit
there and talk back and forth

525
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:47,279
like it was, we really were just
friends, friends inside, inside

526
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,910
the company. But when it, when it
came to that, that, that was

527
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,670
like, that was the only point of
friction in that relationship.

528
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,829
Which was, which was really
strange to me. But I think it's,

529
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,920
the only thing I can chalk it up
to is that that's just how he

530
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,039
was, that was the company
culture. He was, he was trained

531
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:05,910
in and brought up in himself. So
that's the only way he knows to

532
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:14,010
try to help others learn. Um,
but yeah, I think even in that

533
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,039
environment, I think I got
better at asking questions,

534
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,179
because I would, I would ask
something and his response

535
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:25,079
would be like, well, what is,
what is x mean? What is y mean?

536
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,090
I would use the wrong words all
the time, which is very frustrating.

537
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,349
Dan Ott: Can you give an example
of that?

538
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,760
Drew Clements: So like, I would
say something like, you know,

539
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,670
the this, I'm passing this
argument, but it's not coming

540
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:43,889
out the right way, when what I
meant was the method. But I was

541
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:46,530
using the word argument and his
response to be like, well,

542
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,539
obviously, that's not gonna
work. You don't need an argument

543
00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:53,730
there. That's the, I'd be pointing at
it on the screen like, that, right

544
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,639
there. That's what I'm trying to
do. He's like, what? That's not

545
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,619
an argument. I'm like, okay. Fair
enough. So (laugh), like that kind of

546
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:02,070
stuff.

547
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:02,969
Dan Ott: (laugh) Yeah.

548
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,940
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah. You
know, we also see like the issue

549
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:11,190
with entry level devs and the
problem of comfort level with

550
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,579
whoever they're working with.
And I have a lot of feelings

551
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,820
about that. But one of them also
is that not everybody is meant

552
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,210
to be a mentor, right? You know,
some people have like a natural

553
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,539
ability, some people can have
training and get good at it. But

554
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:28,380
some people, you know, they
don't desire it, or they feel

555
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,380
like it takes away from their
experience. And so they're

556
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:36,420
aggravated by it. But a company
not only has to make a space

557
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:40,860
welcoming for new developers,
but it also has to support the

558
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:45,000
upper level devs, who are
providing the mentorship and the

559
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,690
guidance and making sure that,
you know, that culture shows that

560
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,639
how you treat people and talk
to them.

561
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:56,119
Drew Clements: Yeah. That's the, um, so,
one of, Sean, the guy that I mentioned

562
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:00,289
earlier. He was always really
good at, if I ever came to him

563
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:05,030
with a question, he was, his
response was always, you know,

564
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,480
well, let's look at it together.
Or, you know, let's talk me

565
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,760
through the steps you're trying
to do and let's see if we can

566
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,869
find the hang up there. So I
think he's one of those people

567
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:19,219
that just naturally has like, well
I mean, he's, I know he's been a

568
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:22,070
guitar teacher for a while. So
maybe he's just developed those

569
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,820
teaching skills.

570
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,639
Dan Ott: Yeah. Going back to
having a company support the

571
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,239
senior devs in those roles, I
feel like that's an important

572
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:39,320
thing. I guess tying it back to
the framing of making it a rule,

573
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,769
like having the rule of the one
hour thing, for instance, right?

574
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:47,900
That gives the younger developer,
younger, the, you know, early

575
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:53,179
career, newer developer a
guideline to follow, right? But

576
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:57,590
it also implies that the
question should be asked, you

577
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,320
know, and that, and that the
question also should be, you

578
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,059
know, answered or whatever. So,
again, that has to become, I

579
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:07,940
mean, you can just hope that the
senior developer in whatever

580
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:14,929
position is good at it and
everything, but having it be

581
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:17,659
part of the company culture,
having it be expected, you know,

582
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:21,860
that's part of a developer's
role is supporting a junior

583
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,980
developer, or however it works
out. But that part of the

584
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,039
developer's job is doing that.
Not that answering a question,

585
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:34,010
or helping a developer through a
problem is taking time away from

586
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:37,400
doing your job, right? I feel
like that can be something that

587
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,780
can come up, right? Where if
it's not framed correctly, maybe

588
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:46,820
when you were asking a question,
he was just feeling like he had

589
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,550
stuff to do. And this was
getting in the way of doing his

590
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:53,539
stuff or something, you
know? And which is not actually

591
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:56,000
correct, right? Like, it's part
of his job. I mean, I don't know

592
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,610
what the exact situation was there.
But like, it should be part of...

593
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,010
Drew Clements: There was
definitely a lot a lot of moving

594
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:05,630
projects with only one
experienced and one learning

595
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:06,349
developer.

596
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:10,949
Dan Ott: Right. Right. Right.
You know, and not having it

597
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,980
explicit, is a recipe for that
sort of thing to happen, you

598
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:21,000
know? You could maybe have
be lucky. That's what I mean,

599
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,710
like, depending on just hoping (laugh),
hoping that it works out. It

600
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,800
doesn't, that doesn't seem like
the right call. And hiring

601
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:34,230
junior developers is important,
but they need like, the people

602
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,050
hiring them need to be, you
know, prepared, right? Need to be

603
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,550
prepared to support them, but
also prepared to, you know, have

604
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,460
a plan for the senior developers
too. Because it's hard. It's also

605
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:51,510
another whole skill to learn.
And, you know, having some

606
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:54,389
guidelines like that, I feel
like is such a good, such a good

607
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,480
thing to, and sort of almost
easy thing to pull off, right?

608
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,489
Like an easy way to really
improve the situation is just

609
00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:03,210
like, this is how it works. Ask a
question, you know? (laugh) Like, ask

610
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,239
a question after an hour, you
know? Answer the question after,

611
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,460
you know, that when the junior
developer helps like it, or

612
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,909
asks, you know? I just like
that. I like the clarity of

613
00:39:11,909 --> 00:39:12,539
that, you know? I think that's
really cool.

614
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,300
Drew Clements: Yeah. And that
actually reminds me one, one

615
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,019
thing before I knew about the
one hour rule, one thing Sean

616
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:22,590
always did to me that I didn't
know until I, you know, months

617
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:26,550
and months later, is that when
I would ask him a question, he

618
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:31,050
would, he would, he would set like
a timer, like he'll reply within

619
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:35,909
one hour if he doesn't hear
back from me. And I didn't know

620
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:38,250
that was the thing. So like, I,
I just asked him a question, I

621
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,980
keep trying to work on it. And
then there were a lot of times

622
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,900
where like, oh, nevermind. Got it.
And then like, at, what, I think it

623
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,559
was after I'd left the contract
role with him, he's like, yeah,

624
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,679
I used to give you like an hour
anytime you ask a question and

625
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,590
towards the end you got to where
you were responding back within

626
00:39:55,590 --> 00:40:00,570
like 10 minutes that nevermind,
you found the answer. But

627
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,329
touching back on what you were
saying about companies needing

628
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:09,570
to, you know, like proactively
support junior developers.

629
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:13,619
That's one of the things we're
doing on Protege. So all of our,

630
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:18,989
all the listings there are
curated and like, approved by

631
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:23,400
us. That's one thing, when, when
a company lists with us, one

632
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:29,460
thing we gotta do, one thing we
do is, you know, first we read

633
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,469
through the listing and make
sure it kind of lines up with,

634
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,260
with the goals we have for
Protege. But then we also kind

635
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,889
of like dig into the company's
website, and you know, maybe

636
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:41,130
their LinkedIn to try and get
an idea of the company culture

637
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:45,869
like. Are, are they posting
this role because they just

638
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:47,849
want to pay someone cheap? Or
are they posting this role

639
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:50,309
because they genuinely want to
find someone to build them up

640
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:56,550
into the best version that they
can be? And we try to, we try to

641
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,989
make sure we have a good idea
of, of, of the answer to that.

642
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,969
For, for every listing.

643
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,030
Dan Ott: That's really cool. I
mean, and that's like, I feel

644
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,960
like one of, one of the things
that makes Protege, you know,

645
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:15,809
special is the curation and the
sort of insight into the, the

646
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:21,630
junior developer mind, if you will
(laugh), you know? It's, like you

647
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:26,190
said, it's not just a, I don't
know, collection of, of things

648
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:29,130
that people want to find cheap
worker, you know, something like

649
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:29,849
that, right?

650
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:30,960
Drew Clements: Yeah. I'm a,

651
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:31,829
Dan Ott: It's really cool.

652
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,559
Drew Clements: I will always
refer to myself as perpetually,

653
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:38,489
perpetually junior developer. So
hopefully, I will always be able

654
00:41:38,489 --> 00:41:42,570
to keep that mindset. But we
have, I was actually just

655
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,639
talking to some people in the
Virtual Coffee group not too

656
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:49,619
long ago about, about some tools
and features we can add, to

657
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:53,760
hopefully help empower both
sides of the process in our

658
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,019
interface to build.

659
00:41:55,829 --> 00:41:59,429
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: So okay. So,
if you had a magic wand, and you

660
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:01,739
could get everything you want
for Protege, what does it look

661
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:02,099
like?

662
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:05,820
Drew Clements: If I get everything
I want, in terms of features or

663
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,480
success?

664
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:09,090
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Whatever
you want. Let's do it all.

665
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,829
You've got a magic wand. It's
your choice.

666
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:15,239
Drew Clements: If I had a magic wand,
there, there'd be accounts for

667
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:19,829
both candidates and companies,
there'd be, there'd be tools on

668
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:26,670
both ends to do both empower and
protect both sides. I don't

669
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,349
really feel like the companies
would really need much

670
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:32,969
protection. But in some cases,
like maybe the candidates do,

671
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:39,389
especially from, you know, like
ageism, or, or something like

672
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:43,289
that. Yeah, so some, some tools
around like empowering

673
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:45,659
candidates against
discrimination. So like, maybe

674
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:50,369
there, maybe only like their
work history and like, some kind

675
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:54,630
of like generic questions they
answered are available. And the

676
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:59,099
company can't really see what
their you know, name, name,

677
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:03,150
gender, age, or location or
anything like that is until, you

678
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:06,420
know, they schedule an interview
with them and have something

679
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,099
kinda like on the books or
something like that. Or even,

680
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,940
even a tool to where maybe
candidates can say like, you

681
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,300
know, I'm in this time zone, but
I'm willing to work in up to

682
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,480
these are you knows different
stuff like that. I haven't

683
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,250
looked at the, like the company
side of a lot of the job board

684
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:29,880
competitors, which I don't
really consider them

685
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,150
competitors. Because like, they,
they have their niche. They're

686
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,250
doing their thing, we're, we're
trying to solve a completely

687
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,219
different problem. So we'd
really just like all the tools

688
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:40,559
for everyone (laugh). And
that's it.

689
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,429
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: All right,
excellent. I mean, it is so hard

690
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:48,840
to search for a job as an entry
level or junior developer,

691
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,269
because they don't make it
clear. Or you do have those

692
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:54,750
problems where they're like,
yes, we want an entry level

693
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:58,710
developer, but you have to know
all of these things just because

694
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,909
they want to get you to do work
for less money. And that's such

695
00:44:02,909 --> 00:44:05,639
a problem. And we see people
over and over going into those

696
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:10,650
environments and just being, you
know, totally frustrated, and

697
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:13,530
it's affecting their health
because it's such a terrible

698
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:19,170
place to work. But then it's so
hard to find another job. But

699
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,960
it's jus, I don't know. It's
just this, this huge problem.

700
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:27,358
Drew Clements: Yeah. Ideally,
we want to build a network of

701
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:31,259
companies that we know without
a shadow of a doubt, like just

702
00:44:31,438 --> 00:44:34,949
support juniors, like from the
ground up in every direction.

703
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:39,958
And that's, that's really what
we want for it is just, oh,

704
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:42,059
you're, you're a new candidate,
you're looking for a job, okay.

705
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:46,048
Well, we know these 15 guys, or,
you know, these 15 companies

706
00:44:46,048 --> 00:44:50,159
are, are hiring and we have a
good working relationship with

707
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:53,458
all of them. And we know
regardless of where you end up,

708
00:44:53,909 --> 00:44:55,289
any of them are going to take
care of you.

709
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:58,630
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah,
that's so awesome. And it's nice

710
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:02,739
to have connections with
communities where you can see

711
00:45:02,949 --> 00:45:05,739
junior developers who need jobs,
and you know that you can vouch

712
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:09,460
for them too, right? Like,
there's a difference. You'll get

713
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,159
the, I'll get those Twitter
messages like, hey, I saw you

714
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:15,369
asked about your friend wanting
a dotnet job. I want one too.

715
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:19,360
Can you recommend me next? Like,
no (laugh), I don't know you.

716
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:24,369
Drew Clements: (laugh) I actually
just had a, I guess was kind of a

717
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:30,750
screening call last week
with a company that they just

718
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:35,489
like, they hit me up on Twitter,
like, out of nowhere. And I

719
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:39,150
spent like the last 10 minutes
of that interview, like talking

720
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:42,780
someone up from Virtual Coffee,
because that referred them to

721
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:47,400
apply to the application. So
like, the lady I was interviewing

722
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:49,409
with, she's like, okay,
she was about to do like her

723
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,159
little goodbye speech. And I was
like, wait, before you go. Let

724
00:45:49,409 --> 00:45:55,409
me tell you about this person.
And I was like, they do this,

725
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:59,309
they do this, they have this
experience. Look at their

726
00:45:55,409 --> 00:45:59,309
application. Forget about mine.

727
00:45:59,369 --> 00:45:59,940
Dan Ott: Nice.

728
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:04,530
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Okay, so
another thing I want to talk

729
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:08,159
about, because you are just
doing like stacks on stacks of

730
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,210
things. Okay, so you're building
a career, you're building a

731
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:17,309
community slash movement. And
it's an also an open source

732
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:20,369
project, and you're streaming
some of this. So you're like,

733
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:26,010
okay, let me make this even more
difficult (laugh). So I'm going to add

734
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:28,800
the open source maintainer
thing, and I'm going to stream

735
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,590
it. So what was the idea behind
adding those components? And,

736
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,860
you know, I, both I'm interested
in like, how has that been

737
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,880
challenging? But also like, how has
that helped you as well?

738
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:45,050
Drew Clements: Well, we decided
to make an open source, because

739
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:49,610
we wanted a way... Well, one of
the questions we kept asking

740
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:53,690
ourselves early on was like,
what can we do to let the

741
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,849
companies know that the
candidates they're considering

742
00:46:55,849 --> 00:47:01,699
here are, you know, worth, worth
the hire, and one of the ways

743
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:06,650
we thought we can do that was
make it an open source project

744
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:09,440
to where those candidates can
actually contribute to the

745
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,519
platform itself, you know, we,
we display anyone's who's

746
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:18,650
contributed to the project is on
our contributors page. And the

747
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:22,519
idea behind that was that
companies could, ideally in our

748
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:25,639
heads is that played out,
companies come here, they, they

749
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:28,909
want to post a job. And then
they see it on the contributors

750
00:47:28,909 --> 00:47:32,239
page that, oh, so there's
actually six applicants here

751
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,630
that have actively helped to
build the platform I'm listing

752
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:38,719
this job on, you know? Maybe,
maybe that'll help give them

753
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:42,440
some preference or something.
And even if it doesn't, then,

754
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:46,579
you know, we're doing our best
to, to help junior developers,

755
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:49,519
so even if it doesn't help in
that regard, it gives them the

756
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:55,369
opportunity to work on a real
world app that they can add to

757
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:58,820
their resume. I mean, even if
it's just, you know, I think

758
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,610
there's been some contributions
that were just accessibility

759
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:06,139
fixes. But, you know, that may
have just been, you know, from

760
00:48:06,139 --> 00:48:08,780
code perspective, all they did
was changed the Tailwind class, but,

761
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:13,909
you know, they also set up the
project locally, they also, they

762
00:48:13,909 --> 00:48:16,670
also, you know, at least have an
understanding of Git and how

763
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:21,920
that whole process works. So
that was, that was a lot of the

764
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,630
reasons why we decided to do
that. I decided to stream it,

765
00:48:26,659 --> 00:48:33,440
because... Partly because I was
unemployed and bored, partly

766
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,610
because I wanted to force myself
into some accountability. So

767
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:41,150
like, now, there's a lot of
people out there that know this

768
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:47,869
is a thing, so I don't want to
say they're depending on me, but

769
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:53,030
they know it's a thing. And if...
I'd feel really bad if I started

770
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,099
building this thing that was
gonna help the community and

771
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:59,000
then just like, let it go. So
now I have all these people that

772
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,550
know it's a thing and they can
just say, hey, how's, how's that

773
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:06,199
going? And my response can never
be, oh, I turned it off. So

774
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:07,880
that, that's, that's never
gonna be a thing.

775
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,780
Dan Ott: I like that idea of
the streaming for, for

776
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:16,099
accountability, you know? I
mean, the side project issue,

777
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:19,309
you know, of abandoning in or
not, or whatever, and you're

778
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:21,440
right. You're, you already have,
you have an audience of, you

779
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,820
know, you have people coming in,
but that the, the streaming, I

780
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:30,739
feel like is, is a interesting
bit to add, just for like the

781
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:33,800
accountability, part of it, you
know? I think that's really cool.

782
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,409
Drew Clements: Yeah, and
there's, there's actually parts

783
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:39,260
of the application now that
wouldn't exist if it wouldn't

784
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,829
have been for, for streaming
because I'd hit a bug or get

785
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:44,840
hung up on something that I
probably would have never found,

786
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:50,389
but there have been, there been
people in the chat that were,

787
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,420
you know, helping me debug some
stuff. And if you look on the

788
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:59,150
contributors page, the last
three entries on it, it actually

789
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:02,150
just says special commit. Those
are there because those are,

790
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:05,269
those are three people that were
consistently there for, I think

791
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,340
the first two months, I was
working on building a stream to

792
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:12,409
pretty much every day. So those
three people were there for

793
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,179
probably 85% of that streaming
process. And we're doing a lot

794
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:21,860
of like, you know, coaching or
problem solving with me through the

795
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:26,690
chat. So that's what, that's why
we put them up there. Yeah, and

796
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,199
we've had, we haven't really
done much marketing for Protege.

797
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:34,670
I feel, I feel weird trying to
market a thing I built, but it's

798
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:36,769
kind of, kind of through Twitter,
and through streaming, and

799
00:50:36,769 --> 00:50:40,340
through a couple of other
communities, we, we've somehow

800
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:45,679
managed to, we average around
400 users per month, which, you

801
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,789
know, in the, in the larger
scale of Google Analytics

802
00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:53,119
probably isn't a whole lot. But
for, for something I started

803
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,869
building out of nowhere last
year with no marketing, I think

804
00:50:56,869 --> 00:51:01,340
that's pretty good numbers. So
we're really, we have a phase

805
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,860
two, we're kind of like ramping
up for now, which is part of

806
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:10,070
next, the next migration as part
of that. So we want, we want to

807
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:14,389
get those numbers up not
because we want, you know, good

808
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:20,360
analytic points, or whatever the
business side of that is, but if

809
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,000
we can get that number up, then
that's more people that are,

810
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:26,420
that's just more people we're
helping or, you know, maybe it

811
00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:30,710
at least giving hope that you
know, someone's out there doing

812
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,019
something on, on the behalf of
them.

813
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:37,710
Dan Ott: Absolutely. And, you
know, the bigger community gets

814
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:42,449
like around that or audience or
whatever, you know, the more,

815
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,119
it's sort of exponentially
increases the exposure without

816
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:50,760
even doing ads, or you know,
anything specific did grow

817
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,400
it, you know, yeah. That's
really cool.

818
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:54,780
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: All right,
Drew,

819
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:58,739

00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:05,369
Protege and for your one year,

822
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:09,000
whatever you want to call it
going up. So where can our

824
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:16,409
Drew Clements: You can find me
on Twitter @drewclemcr8,

825
00:52:16,409 --> 00:52:21,119
drew-clem-c-r-8, because you know,
all the good handles are taken.

826
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:26,159
You can find me, I haven't been
streaming a lot lately, because

827
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:31,679
of, you know, work and two
kids. But I'm on Twitch at

828
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:36,719
twitch.tv/ducky_87. I used to
do some gaming

829
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:39,869
streaming like, four years ago,
and I just never changed the

830
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:46,559
handle. And now just kind of
like it, so... And you can also

831
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:51,119
find me, you can find me in the
Virtual Coffee sessions. Do you

832
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,760
ever want to pop in and join one
of those? Usually on Tuesdays. I

833
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,440
can't make, I usually can't
make Thursdays.

834
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,679
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah. And
also there's some open issues on

835
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:02,429
Protege. So if you're interested
in contributing, it's a great

836
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,730
project. It's got a great
community behind it. And there's

837
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:09,389
lots of people there too,
willing to help and answer

838
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:13,889
questions. So we're very glad
that you came here on this

839
