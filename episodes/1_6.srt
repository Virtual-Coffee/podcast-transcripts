00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,829
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 1, Episode

2
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:23,160
6 of the Virtual Coffee Podcast.
I'm Bekah, and this is

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,100
a podcast that features members
of the Virtual Coffee community.

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,820
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,335
stages of their coding journey.
And they're here, on this

6
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:32,850
podcast,

7
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,030
sharing their stories and what
they've learned. And we're here

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,990
to share it with you. Here with
me today is my co-host, Dan.

9
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,759
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. In this
episode, you'll hear from Drew

10
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,539
Clements. Drew is a career
transitioner, a father of two

11
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,109
and full time developer. And he
spends his spare time building

12
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,799
protege.dev and hopes to become
a strong advocate for junior

13
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,130
developers everywhere. In this
episode, we talk about building

14
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,939
a career, and also Drew's
experience building protege.dev

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,290
the platform curated with remote
jobs for junior developers. Drew

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,560
talks about the struggles of
junior level job searching, the

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,140
importance of supportive company
culture, and learning in

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,489
public while building Protege.

19
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,340
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,700
like we start every Virtual
Coffee. We introduce ourselves

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,939
with our name, where we're from,
what we do, and a random

22
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,079
check-in question. Today's
question is, what is the most

23
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,909
beautiful place near where you
live? We hope you enjoyed this

24
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:44,819
episode. Hey, I'm Bekah, I'm a
front-end

25
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:49,140
developer from a small town in
Ohio, and the most beautiful

26
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:53,040
place near me, I don't really
know. But it snowed a lot last

27
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,950
night. And so all of the pine
trees look really, really

28
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,170
beautiful. So I'm just gonna go
with pine trees covered with

29
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,170
snow.

30
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,930
Dan: That's awesome. I love how
everything looks with snow

31
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,670
on it. Hi, I'm Dan. I am a
front-end developer from

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,370
Cleveland, Ohio. I say Cleveland
every time. I'm actually from

33
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,904
Lakewood, which is first city
West of Cleveland. And so there

34
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:14,438
is a

35
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:18,849
park called Lakewood Park that's
on the lake here. And it's very

36
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:21,400
beautiful. There's lots of--
it's big, and there's lots of

37
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,789
cool little spots to hang out.
So that's that.

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,449
Drew Clements: I'm Drew. I'm a
front-end developer with Foster

39
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:36,750
Commerce. The most beautiful
place near where I live. I live

40
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,270
in the south, so my options are
limited here. So, I'm, like,

41
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,849
five minutes from St. Simons
Island. But the beaches aren't

42
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:48,659
necessarily pretty. They just
have expensive resorts. And I'm,

43
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:51,599
like-- I'm just out to Savannah.
So they have a pretty rad

44
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,104
downtown. But-- okay, I got one.
I got one. On the other side of

45
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:57,142
the state from me, which is
still relatively close compared

46
00:02:57,142 --> 00:03:00,180
to you

47
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,500
guys. We have-- they call it the
little Grand Canyon. It's a

48
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,349
little hiking trail. It really
does just look like a miniature

49
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,400
version of the Grand Canyon.

50
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,500
Dan: Nice. That's cool. That
sounds cool. Yeah.

51
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,210
Bekah: Vacation 2021. Well,
welcome, Drew. We

52
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,370
are very happy to have you. And
fun fact about Drew, he designed

53
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,310
the Virtual Coffee logo. So,
thanks for that.

54
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,680
Drew: I do what I can [laughs].

55
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,819
Bekah: We always like to start
off with the

56
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:34,530
origin story of how you got into
tech. So, can you give us a

57
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,129
little background?

58
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:41,000
Drew: Yeah, that's-- I feel like
my story into tech is

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,030
like a story linked to a story,
linked to a story. So, growing

60
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,719
up, I played in bunch of punk
rock bands. One of the last

61
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,770
bands I played in, I met a guy
from the local music scene named

62
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,729
Sean. Sean moved away to
California and became a

63
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:02,044
developer. Right before he did
that, I tattooed him. Me

64
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:05,359
tattooing

65
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:10,400
landed me in apprenticeship as a
designer a few years later,

66
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,579
which then led me-- that's where
I was kind of introduced to,

67
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:15,888
like,

68
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:20,720
HTML and CSS. So I was like,
"Hey, I'm learning this stuff."

69
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,819
I remember Sean was doing
something like this. So then, I

70
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:25,250
reached back out to him. Me and
him started kind of talking

71
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:32,300
again. So from there, I was able
to kind of work into a developer

72
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:40,040
role with that same company and
left tattooing. So it's- it's a

73
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,300
guy I met through the local
music scene in 2010 ended up

74
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,879
getting me into developing a
decade later. Yeah, so I spent

75
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,329
seven years as a tattoo artist,
transitioned to graphic design.

76
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:56,779
From graphic design, I used to
know that Sean—the old

77
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:02,930
connection—to get my way here.
And I don't think I could have

78
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,420
made that happen if I had all
the money in the world and 10

79
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,160
years to plan it, but here I am.

80
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,939
Bekah: That's awesome. So, if we
ever have a

81
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:14,300
Virtual Coffee on-site
conference, are you going to

82
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,360
offer tattoos? All Virtual
Coffee logos?

83
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,300
Drew: [Laughs] Yes, I will do
that.

84
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,579
Bekah: All right, we have it
recorded. So now you

85
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:29,300
can't back out. Okay. So, I'm
also want to know about how you

86
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,939
found Virtual Coffee. I feel
like I have known you longer, a

87
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:38,990
lot longer than Virtual Coffee
has been going on. So-- but how

88
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,850
did you end up at Virtual
Coffee?

89
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,459
Drew: How did I end up with
Virtual Coffee? It's funny

90
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,370
enough that we're recording this
on a podcast, because I met you

91
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,879
through reaching out to find
people to interview for a

92
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,740
podcast I was going to start.
So- so I have the recording

93
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,720
actually. I don't know if it- I
don't know if it ever got

94
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,860
editing. I don't [laughs]. I
just had it right here on the

95
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,000
desk. No. So, I guess in 2019, I
was going to start a

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,669
podcast, I reached out to you.
We connected on Twitter. That

97
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:14,939
never ended up happening. But
we-- when

98
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:18,420
I saw you posting-- so, at the
beginning of 2020, I was- I was

99
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:17,939
working two jobs. I was working
full time as a designer,

100
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:23,550
part-time as a developer. An
awesome-- both of those job

101
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:27,839
within, like, 24 hours of each
other. And with a wife that was

102
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:31,800
five months pregnant, that was
kind of like a gut

103
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:35,639
check. But around that same time
was when you'd posted about

104
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:39,329
Virtual Coffee. So, like, you
know, I have a lot of spare time

105
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,699
on my hands, Bekah posts a lot
of awesome stuff, we had a great

106
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:46,649
conversation when we recorded
our podcast episode together. So

107
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:51,689
I was like, "Yeah, let me- let
me check this out and see what

108
00:06:46,649 --> 00:07:01,800
happens." And now, you can't get
rid of me [laughs].

109
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,505
Bekah: I think that podcast
episode that I

110
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,850
recorded with you, I had just

111
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:09,029
been working with Dan for a
couple of months. And I, like,

112
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:11,550
was still trying to wrap my head
around things. And I remember

113
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:14,160
you asking me questions and I
were like, "I don't even know

114
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,904
the words that I should use to
answer those questions." So

115
00:07:13,904 --> 00:07:16,258
[laughs]--

116
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,100
Drew: If it's any consolation,
there's still a lot

117
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,404
of times I don't know the words
I should use to answer

118
00:07:21,404 --> 00:07:22,708
questions [laughs].

119
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,449
Bekah: Yeah, that's for sure.
Same.

120
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,774
Same. [Laughs] But it was- it
was, like, it was really great

121
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:29,099
podcast

122
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,649
interview because you're just
some fun to be around, I guess.

123
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:39,300
So, I'm happy that you are here
with us today. And at Virtual

124
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:39,810
Coffee.

125
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,379
Drew: Happy to be here. Like I
said, you can't get rid of me.

126
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:50,039
Bekah: [Laughs] Okay. So fast
forward a little bit,

127
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,380
you got another job, you're
career changer. And you're like,

128
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,660
"Oh, hey.

129
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:01,139
I bought this domain called
protege.dev. So on top of all of

130
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,069
the other things that I'm doing,
I'm- I'm gonna start this

131
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,230
community building project." So,
why and how?

132
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,948
Drew: Why and how? Well, so, I
originally bought the

133
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:17,334
Protege domain-- to the back up
just a little bit. I had an old

134
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:23,290
side project called ColtXP. It's
a really bad name. Never name

135
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,800
anything that, ever. But that's
what the original podcast that I

136
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,339
interviewed you for was going to
kind of be in parallel with

137
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:36,789
that. And so I- I knew that it
was a bad name. So I was trying

138
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,679
to think of something- something
else I could call it. The idea

139
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,840
of that project was that-- it
was gonna be pretty much a place

140
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,429
where people could connect to
work on open source issues

141
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:51,730
together, kind of like a junior
finding a senior willing to, you

142
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,110
know, give them some time. So I
was just trying to think the-

143
00:08:56,139 --> 00:09:01,929
the name ColtXP-- I think I just
used, like, a Thesaurus or

144
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:04,539
something. Like, what's another
word for someone that's learning

145
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:08,259
something or something like
that. And Colt was somehow on

146
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:10,539
that list. It was like an
inexperienced person or

147
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:15,190
something like that. Again,
horrible name. Don't ever call

148
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:21,909
anything yet. So I came across
the word protege, you know,

149
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,210
pretty obvious. I don't know why
I didn't think of it in the

150
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:29,230
first place. So I was looking
around on different domains.

151
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:32,139
Actually, no. I went to Netlify.
And I was like, "Let me see if

152
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,769
protege.com is available."
Obviously, it wasn't. So I was

153
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:39,580
like, "Let me see if protege.dev
is available." It was. For 15

154
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,085
bucks. I was like, "That's not
bad at all." So I hit the next

155
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:44,590
button,

156
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,460
expecting there to be, like,
insert payment information. And

157
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:54,970
it said "Congratulations". I was
like, "Okay. I guess this is a

158
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,799
thing now. So I kind of went
back and forth on, "Do I want to

159
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,669
make that something new with
that name? Do I want to rebrand

160
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,534
the old project under
Protege—which was the original

161
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:09,399
idea?" But

162
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,669
then- but then COVID happened,
and I lost- I lost both of those

163
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:18,340
jobs. So I think- I think I
accidentally bought the domain

164
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:24,970
in February, and then in March
was when I lost work. So, you

165
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,039
know, I was looking-- I lost
work, so I was looking at all

166
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,470
the job boards all the time. And
it was, you know, you see

167
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,700
senior, senior, senior lead,
tech lead, bla bla bla. And

168
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,700
I was like, "There's, like,
there's nothing-- it's so

169
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,360
hard to find anything for
someone at my skill level." So I

170
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,370
was like, "You know what? I'm
just gonna build the job board

171
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,980
that I wish I had." And that's-
that's kind of how it ended up

172
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,710
getting started. I lost- I lost
my job and gave myself a new

173
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,159
one [laughs]. A new one that
doesn't pay anything.

174
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,744
Dan: I love that. I love the
idea of, like, you just-- you

175
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:01,168
have

176
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:05,669
a problem, you know, and so you
just decided to fix it [laughs]-

177
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:07,529
to fix it yourself, right?

178
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:09,239
Drew: That's- that's pretty much
what happened.

179
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,568
Dan: Yeah, it's amazing. And
then, on top of that, you know-

180
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,639
you know you're going to gain
experience for yourself, you

181
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,308
know? And building it, right? We
were just talking to Vic. And

182
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:23,458
he's talking about a lot of this
sort of the same thing, right?

183
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,988
Like, the-- he frames it a
little differently. But the

184
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:26,518
indie, you

185
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,418
know, indie hacking mentality,
right, of you have a problem.

186
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:34,019
And so instead of, I don't know,
wandering around or just being

187
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,288
sad, you know? Right? Like, you
just kind of go and- go and dive

188
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:41,788
into it, right? And hopefully,
it becomes a successful product.

189
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,198
And also, you know, you're
giving yourself, like,

190
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:44,608
experience,

191
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:45,718
and scratching your own itch,
and all that stuff. That's

192
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:46,827
great.

193
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,549
Drew: Yeah, the-- when I first
started out on Protege, my

194
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:52,829
mindset was, you know, "I'm
going to build this thing in

195
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:55,109
React. I

196
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,429
need-- I needed a React project
on my portfolio." So I told

197
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:03,120
myself, like, "I'm gonna- I'm
gonna build this out. And if it

198
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,860
works, awesome. If not, then I
have something on a resume that

199
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,705
will maybe at least helped get
me hired," which it actually

200
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:11,460
did,

201
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,129
fairly- fairly early on. So I
think I started building it in

202
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:19,440
March. And either at the end of
March or early April, I was

203
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,250
connected with a company called
Layer Frame out of Florida.

204
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,740
Super awesome team. And the
workout done on Protege, even at

205
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,450
that point, before it was even
done. Just the fact that I was

206
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:36,870
doing that, you know, building
that product, but also the work

207
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:40,334
I'd put into it myself, pretty
much jumping in blind was one

208
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:43,798
of-

209
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,529
one of the reasons that they can
even consider to bring me on

210
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:50,399
the team. So it saved me almost
immediately.

211
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,669
Bekah: I think that's so great.
I think there's

212
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,919
a tendency when you are starting
out as an entry level dev to

213
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,620
just keep going through the
tutorials, right? And there's

214
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,039
nothing wrong with that. But
there's so many different people

215
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,399
that are doing those same
projects. So if you're able to

216
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,309
do something where you're
building something that you're

217
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:14,279
interested in or something that
solves a problem for you, you're

218
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,490
a little bit invested in it, but
it also shows that, "Hey, look,"

219
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,425
you know, "I tackled this
problem, and I kept adding to

220
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:21,360
it,

221
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,309
and growing with it." And I
think that really shows, you

222
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:25,258
know, a

223
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:28,049
really good representation of
who you are as a coder.

224
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,110
Dan: Yeah, you mentioned, like,
when you were describing

225
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,134
talking to the company who hired
you after that, that you went

226
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:39,158
into

227
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,970
the- the Protege project going
in blind. And I was- I was

228
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,665
wondering, like, what you--
like, in hindsight, like, what

229
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:46,360
do you

230
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,879
think of when you say that?
Like, what pieces were you

231
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,659
missing, you know? Now that
you've gone through the whole

232
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:56,019
process, and it's been a
product, you know, for however

233
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,474
long, I just looked at my watch
to see what month it was. I

234
00:13:57,474 --> 00:13:58,929
don't know

235
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:00,294
what I'm doing. But, you know,
it's- it's been a, you know,

236
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:03,789
it's been live for how many
months?

237
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:05,439
Drew: Coming up on a year. I
think March will be a year.

238
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,049
Dan: Okay, yeah. So, I guess, my
question is [laughs]- my

239
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:12,174
question is, like, what- what
do-- you know, now that, like,

240
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:13,299
would

241
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:14,769
change your approach, if
anything-- you know, if you

242
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:16,239
would

243
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,210
start-- if you were starting
protege.dev right now?

244
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,195
Drew: How much time do you have?
[Laughs] It was-- so,

245
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,940
the initial

246
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,679
build was just a regular Create
React App. That was intentional

247
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,110
because I wanted to force myself
to learn some of the lower level

248
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:40,419
plumbing. I wish I would have
known more about state

249
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:45,850
management in React. Like, I
kinda-- so, right before this

250
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,710
episode, we were talking about
how some of the- some of the

251
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,370
parts of it are really just a
juggling act until, you know, it

252
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:58,419
either dies or does what it's
supposed to do. So, I think, if

253
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,370
I would have known a little bit
more around that, that could

254
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,725
have been-- I don't think it's
an unstable system. But it's not

255
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:05,080
as

256
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,840
good as it can be. And I'm
actually in the process of

257
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:14,110
rewriting some of that work now.
And I expect I'm going to be

258
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,250
able to eliminate probably about
40% of what's there now, and

259
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,539
have something that works better
in, you know, with better

260
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:26,830
practices in place at the same
time. Also, I didn't really know

261
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,184
much about, like, component
systems. Like, I knew what

262
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:31,538
components

263
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:35,200
were, but I didn't really have a
good idea of how to utilize them

264
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,539
correctly, which is another
thing I've been kind of cleaning

265
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:40,779
up as I've been doing this
rebuild. We're converting from

266
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:47,080
React-- Create React App to Next
right now. So, I mean, even just

267
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,149
last night, I was looking at
some stuff, like, why didn't I

268
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,299
just make this a component
rather than pasting it seven

269
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:57,519
times in the same place? Yeah.
So, just- just little stuff like

270
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:57,909
that.

271
00:15:58,678 --> 00:16:00,568
Bekah: It's interesting. I used
to write

272
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:03,989
screenplays with my brother. And
one of the first bits of advice

273
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:05,908
someone told me—or I heard—it
was, "Write your whole

274
00:16:05,908 --> 00:16:07,827
screenplay,

275
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:09,838
and then cut 50%, and then
rewrite it." And, like, as

276
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:11,817
you're

277
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:13,723
talking through this, that kind
of makes sense to me in terms

278
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,628
of,

279
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:18,778
like, okay, you have something
down and you learned a lot in

280
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:22,078
that first process. But what you
learn should enable you to

281
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:25,469
really tighten things up and
getting it working efficiently

282
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:28,649
or- or making it an effective
story. And codes not that

283
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:29,548
different from that.

284
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,039
Drew: Yeah, that was what
Andy's—the co-founder—he

285
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:38,059
came on really early on with me.
One- one thing we were very

286
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:41,299
adamant about when we were
starting up was that we're going

287
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:48,470
to try to build as much of this
as possible without a library

288
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,129
if we can. So that's why- that's
why a lot of the state

289
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:55,009
management with some of the
forms are a bit of a juggling

290
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:57,919
act, because we knew there was,
you know, Redux and other things

291
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,570
like that out there. But we
wanted to kind of put ourselves

292
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,619
in the uncomfortable position of
having to build it, the only

293
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,670
having to build it with whatever
we had available to us then

294
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:13,849
without grabbing something off
the shelf. And-- I mean, he

295
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:17,374
would probably agree, we both
probably-- we learned- we

296
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:20,899
learned

297
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,950
a lot of wrong ways to handle
state React. We learned a

298
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,890
lot of ways that you can do it,
but probably aren't ideal. And

299
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,025
now we're- now we're getting
into the phase of, you know,

300
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:34,160
now- now

301
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,440
we can do it the right way with
an understanding of why it's the

302
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:36,950
right way.

303
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:43,109
Dan: Yeah, that enable that-
that agreement at the beginning,

304
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,729
and between you and your partner
was-- is, like, a very, very

305
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:46,318
cool

306
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,500
thing to do. Especially, you
know, it's nice to have

307
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,989
alignment and that sort of
thing, you know? But I mean, I

308
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,909
always-

309
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,180
always- always say the best way
to learn anything, on any sort

310
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,970
of deep level is to do it, just
like you guys have done. And

311
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,829
state management in particular,
I mean, like, a lot of things

312
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:03,508
are like

313
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:05,219
this. But state management is
one of those, where there's a

314
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:06,929
million

315
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,840
ways to do it. None of them are
right or wrong, really. And

316
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,750
the--

317
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,559
but you never really-- you never
gonna have actual full insight

318
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,160
into why you-- why to make one
choice or the other. Why to use

319
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,890
Redux versus, you know, anything
else. It-- by reading tutorials,

320
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,900
you're never gonna figure it
out, right? Like, you're never,

321
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,779
like, somebody could say, "Use
Redux for this x, y and z," you

322
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:32,774
know? "Don't use Redux here,"
you know? And you could sort of

323
00:18:32,774 --> 00:18:34,769
try

324
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:37,859
to follow them. But you're never
gonna-- you don't understand why

325
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,480
until you've gone down the road
of hacking it together, and then

326
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,180
getting to the spot where you're
like, "Okay, this-- I see now."

327
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,609
Like, "This is not working out,
or this is like more of a pain

328
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:49,004
than it should be, or," you
know, or whatever. Or, "I don't

329
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,399
trust it

330
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,290
as much," which is- which is one
of the-- like, one of the- one

331
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,180
of

332
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,269
the things that's hard to
explain until you feel it,

333
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,730
right? So you have that-- you're
talking about that form state.

334
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,900
And just not, like, you know, it
can be better, you know? Like,

335
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,180
it's working and stuff, but you
know, like, there's some-

336
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,720
there's some area where it's not
exactly sure what's going on or

337
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,930
can't track, you know, all the
different pieces of state or all

338
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,894
the different, you know, figures
[??] that go on. Like, that's

339
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:17,190
really great.

340
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,410
Drew: Yeah. And even when
we're-- even while I'm coming

341
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:26,880
through it now, I'm realizing,
I'm kind of reflecting back on

342
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,549
where I was last year, and,
like, I can kind of like see the

343
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:31,574
growth that I've had over the
last year. It's, like, as I'm--

344
00:19:31,574 --> 00:19:33,599
as I

345
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,150
rebuilding part to this, I'm
looking at- I'm looking at some

346
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,545
of the state, and I'm like,
"Okay, this- this definitely

347
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:38,940
needs to

348
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,849
be, you know, handled somewhere
else in a more safer way. But

349
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,779
this is actually perfectly fine
to just be, you know, in this

350
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:47,909
one component, and that's all it
needs." And it's-- I don't know.

351
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:50,039
I--

352
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:52,469
me, a year ago, would be, like,
so jealous of me right now

353
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:54,569
[laughs],

354
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:59,400
that I'm, like, able to set them
in a position to, like, to

355
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,890
know the difference of one and
why.

356
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:03,630
Bekah: I think that's a really
good point too,

357
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,019
because there's always this
tricky thing where you feel

358
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:08,699
like, "Oh, I have not-- I
haven't grown enough." But look,

359
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:10,379
you're

360
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,349
talking about this one year
journey and how much you've

361
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:15,569
learned, you know? You've grown
a lot through that. And

362
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:19,079
sometimes, it feels very slow.
But really, you're- you're

363
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:19,950
moving a ton.

364
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,160
Drew: Yeah. And this is actually
my-- this is my first

365
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,890
year as a full time developer.
So before this, I was either--

366
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,380
I was working part-time, which
was, you know, like, maybe 15

367
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,289
hours after I got done with a
full time job. So, like, you

368
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:38,049
know, I was already probably
coming in at, like, 60% mental

369
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:45,940
[??] capacity. And then, the job
I had in the agency before that,

370
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,750
it was a developer role, but it
was- it was with a bunch of

371
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,950
proprietary stuff, and some
older languages. So, like, a lot

372
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,614
of it didn't really-- so, I
mean, a lot of it was just

373
00:20:55,614 --> 00:20:57,278
customer

374
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:03,190
support to begin with. And the
smaller majority after that was,

375
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:09,039
you know, it was in- in such a
sandboxed and specific place

376
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,170
that a lot of it couldn't really
translate over. What I-- one

377
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,420
thing I wanted to double back on
you said there, the- the

378
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,829
alignment between me and Andy, a
lot of that was able to happen

379
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:23,199
was because-- I mean, I was- I
was very junior when I just

380
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,569
decided

381
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:30,400
to go full tilt on this, but
Andy was the same way. Andy

382
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,549
was working full time as a
project manager, you know? He

383
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:35,619
had written some code before. I
don't know the full extent of

384
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:40,750
his- of his experience before
that, but when he approached me,

385
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,150
he was like, "Hey, I've had a
similar idea. I'm kind of in the

386
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,744
same spot." So when- when we
were kind of like spitballing

387
00:21:45,744 --> 00:21:48,338
ideas,

388
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:51,730
we were like, you know, "Let's
keep it simple. Check. Let's

389
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,450
build as much as we can without
libraries. Check." So I think- I

390
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,500
think part of the reason we were
able to align on so many things

391
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,609
in the beginning is that we
were—for the most part—in

392
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:09,400
pretty much the exact same spot,
career wise. Shoutout to Andy,

393
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,950
by the way. He just started full
time as a developer, I think,

394
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,250
within the last few weeks. So,
congrats on that.

395
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:16,259
Bekah: Yeah, for sure.

396
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:17,009
Dan: Congrats to Andy.

397
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:25,529
Bekah: Andy is also very
awesome. Okay. So,

398
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:29,250
simultaneously, you are
establishing a career as an

399
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:34,259
early career developer, and you
are tackling a big problem in

400
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:37,710
the industry, right? So, can we
talk a little bit about the

401
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:38,430
challenges of balancing both of
those things?

402
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:44,029
Drew: I don't know if there's a
balance as much as I just

403
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:47,419
put as much weight on both all
the time [laughs]. Which

404
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:50,779
is why

405
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:52,924
I'm probably on, like, a beeline
to burnout at some point

406
00:22:52,924 --> 00:22:55,069
[laughs]. I

407
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:58,849
don't know. It's-- I don't know.
I haven't really thought about

408
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:01,819
it. There's not much for
balance. Or I guess, I don't

409
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:06,349
really have a process for
balancing it. So, like, I'm

410
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:09,289
really bad about saying yes when
people ask me for stuff. So,

411
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:14,089
like, I joined up with Layer
Frame. And then—thanks to a

412
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:17,089
tweet that you sent out, Bekah—I
was propositioned for some other

413
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:20,809
contract work that ended up
happening, like, right alongside

414
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:25,700
that that turned into the full
time role that I have now. So,

415
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,730
I'm like, "Okay, cool. I won't
have two jobs anymore." Like, a

416
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,274
month after that, someone else
was like, "Hey, I got some

417
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:31,818
contract--

418
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:33,319
or do you want to jump in on?"
I'm like, "Absolutely! [Laughs]

419
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,819
Let's do it."

420
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:42,289
So, I've had a bad habit of
keeping two jobs.

421
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:45,089
Bekah: Yeah. It's so hard to
balance. I'm not-- I'm

422
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:47,430
certainly not good at that
either. And that's one of the

423
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,549
things that I'm working at,
figuring out I like go through

424
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:54,900
these cycles. I'm, like, all in
for six weeks. And then, for an

425
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,950
entire week, I feel like I can't
move. And that's obviously not

426
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,614
healthy [laughs]. I'm trying to
find better ways of doing that.

427
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:02,278
But

428
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:05,069
also, there's just this weird--
I don't know. Tech just move so

429
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:09,809
fast all the time. And you want
to level up as a new developer.

430
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:12,749
And at the same time, you're so
aware of the problems of, I

431
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:15,689
don't

432
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,819
know, like, being an entry level
developer position that you want

433
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:24,539
to tackle them when you have
that passion. So there is this

434
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:32,910
weird, you know, how do I do all
of these things and still take

435
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,079
care of myself.

436
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:36,579
Drew: That's- that's one thing
I've planned to focus

437
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:40,450
on this year is getting the
stuff done that I want to, in a

438
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:45,190
healthy way. I will say, one
silver lining to taking on all

439
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,019
that extra contract work is
I've- I've walked away with

440
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,848
probably

441
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:52,299
at least two to three things
that I didn't know before I

442
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:58,720
started the project. I really
forget where that sentence was

443
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,329
going [laughs]. That was gonna
be a good one too.

444
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:04,000
Bekah: [Laughs] And that's we,
all the time.

445
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:04,900
Dan: Yes.

446
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:08,229
Drew: Oh, no. So, it allowed- it
allowed me to work

447
00:25:08,229 --> 00:25:09,189
with a couple

448
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:12,069
of different-- or, you know,
just developers with different

449
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:13,404
styles. So, when I was with
Layer Frame, I was working with

450
00:25:13,404 --> 00:25:14,739
Rob.

451
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:20,710
And I feel like Rob was just,
like, a mastermind with

452
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,250
everything. So, like, anytime I
had a- anytime I had a problem,

453
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,460
he had a solution for it. And he
was really good at walking me

454
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,500
through how he got to the
solution. So I walked away with

455
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,420
some really good troubleshooting
skills from that.

456
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,289
And then, when I-- on this last
contract role that I just-- at

457
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:39,819
the end of last year, I was
working with a guy named Nick.

458
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,759
And he's just- he's just super
knowledgeable around React. And,

459
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,664
like, some of-- there's, like,
so many tools and methods in

460
00:25:47,664 --> 00:25:49,569
React

461
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:53,500
that I didn't even know were a
thing until I was able to work

462
00:25:53,500 --> 00:26:01,869
with him. So it-- I overload
myself a lot. But so far, I've

463
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:05,440
walked away- I've walked away in
the green from it.

464
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,369
Bekah: I want to come back to
this idea of

465
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:13,960
talking about Rob, and one, just
like, learning in general. So,

466
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,849
do you have a measure or a point
where you think, "Okay, I have

467
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:22,599
been trying to figure out this
problem. And I know that this

468
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:25,480
other person knows the answer."
So, at what point do you ask?

469
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,230
Like, how far down the rabbit
hole do you go before you ask

470
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:29,680
for help?

471
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:36,779
Drew: So, at my full time job,
we have a one hour

472
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:40,410
rule. If you get stuck for more
than an hour, then reach out to

473
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:45,089
someone. And I think that's kind
of been rubbing off on me for

474
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:49,470
my side projects. I'm in a
couple of different communities

475
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,609
that I kind of know which one
will probably more than likely

476
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:55,364
have the answers I need or will
be—dependent on the time of

477
00:26:55,364 --> 00:27:03,210
day—may just be more available.
So I usually try to hit it if,

478
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,569
you know, right at the one hour
mark, depending on how hard I'm

479
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:09,359
spinning my wheels. Some--
sometimes, I know there's been a

480
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,204
few times, like, I just-- I hit
a wall and, like, I don't even

481
00:27:11,204 --> 00:27:13,049
know

482
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:15,450
how to start scaling this thing.
So I'm just gonna immediately

483
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,000
reach out. But then, there's
sometimes, like, you know, I go

484
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,720
through- I go through my
troubleshooting process. And if

485
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,339
I still can't really get
anywhere, I have a couple

486
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:29,849
different places I can reach out
to the-- what I love about the

487
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:33,869
communities that I'm in is that
in most cases, it's rare that

488
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:37,380
they're just gonna give me the
answer. But they're more so

489
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,069
going to work through it with me
and almost kind of rubber

490
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:45,029
duck me to the answer. So that's
always super awesome.

491
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:51,299
Dan: Nice. Yeah. Like, I mean,
that one hour mark? Seems

492
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:54,539
like a good, like, rule of
thumb, you know, for that sort

493
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:58,529
of thing. That question comes up
a lot, you know? And with- with

494
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:05,009
newer-- early career developers,
you know? I mean, that exact

495
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:06,960
question comes up a lot. A lot
of people are wondering it, and

496
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,480
it's hard to sort of baseline
it. I feel like the answer can

497
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:15,480
sometimes change depending on
the company, if you're-- I mean,

498
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,560
if you're working-- like, this
is not for side projects, but

499
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,640
you

500
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,549
know, at a job. And I've been
finding it very-- like, it seems

501
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:25,529
like a good thing to have an
actual rule for—like you said—

502
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:26,999
that.

503
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:30,599
That's where you learned it
from, have it written down,

504
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:34,349
you know, and make it-- make
sure it's okay for early career

505
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:37,019
developers to ask questions, you
know? And, like, let them know

506
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:40,410
when to do it, right? Because
you know what? I mean, nobody

507
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,200
wants to ask a question right
away every time they don't know

508
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,349
anything, you know? But it
always is going to be like-

509
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:50,984
like doing the rubber ducky
thing is just, like, such a

510
00:28:50,984 --> 00:28:52,078
useful

511
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,009
tool for any developer of any-
any skill or, you know, learning

512
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:58,604
level. It just that one hour
mark seems- seems cool. I don't

513
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:01,199
know.

514
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,470
Drew: Yeah. Speaking of rubber
ducks, my-- we did-- two

515
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,650
years ago, we did Secret Santa
for the family. My sister got

516
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,190
me-- she didn't know what- she
didn't know what to get me. So

517
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:17,819
she just googled, like, coder
gift ideas. And she got me this.

518
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,890
It says- it says, "Hi! I'm Stu,
your debugging friend.

519
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,930
Tell me your steps, and we'll
find the bug together!" It's-

520
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,710
it's right here, on my desk. And
he does exactly that.

521
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,019
Dan: That's amazing.

522
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:36,059
Bekah: I- I have a problem of, I
think, early in

523
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:39,599
my career. It was I don't know
if I should ask a question. And

524
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:43,680
now that I'm a little bit in,
it's the stubbornness in me that

525
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,587
I have to tackle, like, "I can
do this," you know? [Laughs]

526
00:29:44,587 --> 00:29:45,494
Like, "I

527
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:47,308
don't

528
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:49,214
have to ask a question." This is
a real check of, I don't know,

529
00:29:49,214 --> 00:29:51,119
what does

530
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,710
that, like, hubris or something?
[Laughs]

531
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,350
Drew: [Laughs] Yeah. No, I
have-- the first kind of

532
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,230
developer

533
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:04,240
role I was in, the senior dev I
worked with, he was- he was very

534
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,119
much trained the old-school way
and brought up with the

535
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:12,099
old-school mentality. So, any--
anytime I would come to

536
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:15,190
questions with him, he would
assume that, like, I got to the

537
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,190
question or I got to the problem
and immediately ask the

538
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,210
question. And that's kind of how
he would react to me. Like,

539
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,474
there's a lot of tension there.
Like, it got to the point where

540
00:30:24,474 --> 00:30:26,018
I

541
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:29,920
didn't want to ask him a
question because I knew what-- I

542
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,819
knew the vibe and what the
response was going to be. What

543
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:36,579
was actually happening is, like,
I was spinning my wheels for,

544
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:41,170
like, two hours trying to not
have to ask him a question. And

545
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,714
then, when I did ask the
question, it was, like, you

546
00:30:42,714 --> 00:30:44,258
know,

547
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:50,319
grief conflict? A whole bunch of
tension. So it's-- I don't know.

548
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:53,109
It's- it's been like a breath of
fresh air slash a huge relief

549
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:55,899
that,

550
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:01,119
A, I've found the communities
that have found and have places

551
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:05,349
that I can ask questions, but B,
now, with a company that, like--

552
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,859
that had-- that has their own
rule for when you should ask

553
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:12,700
questions, and a lot of times,
they're- they're gonna chop that

554
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,490
hour down to, like, 30 minutes
or, like, any time I'm on a

555
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,440
project, they're like, "Hey, one
hour rule is actually 10 minutes

556
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,390
here,"

557
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,730
when our rules actually 20
minutes here. And they actually

558
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,424
want you to ask questions. They
have-- we have an entire thread

559
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:27,819
[??] in basecamp where it's just
different developers asking

560
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:31,509
different questions. And
there's-- it's just super

561
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:32,380
awesome thing to be a part of.

562
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,750
Dan: That's really-- that's
cool. That's really cool to

563
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:38,259
hear. Like, the-- per project or
something, they'll- they'll just

564
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:39,309
say, "Okay, for this project, we
know it's, like, new or

565
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:40,359
something,

566
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,147
or a lot of moving pieces. So
change the rule," you know?

567
00:31:41,147 --> 00:31:41,904
Based

568
00:31:41,905 --> 00:31:43,420
on that.

569
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:45,930
Drew: Yeah. And they-- they're-
they're really aware of,

570
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:50,910
like, skill level and expertise
with the different-- with

571
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:55,170
different tools and stuff. So if
they're bringing me on to a

572
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,974
project that uses, you know,
like, a legacy build that they

573
00:31:57,974 --> 00:32:00,778
know I

574
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:03,539
haven't really seen a whole lot,
then- then that's when they'll

575
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,134
say, "Hey, your- your window's
15 minutes for this." Or if

576
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:08,729
they're

577
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,059
moving, in some cases, even some
of the more experienced devs on

578
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:15,509
to something where it's a little
more intricate UI work, where

579
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:17,069
they're mostly, you know, data
back-end stuff, like, "Hey,

580
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:18,629
okay.

581
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,609
Well, now your window's 10
minutes," and met-- but mine

582
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:22,588
will

583
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:24,104
still be the full hour so that
they're- they're really aware

584
00:32:24,104 --> 00:32:25,619
of,

585
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:29,970
like, where everyone's at. And,
like, adjusting their windows

586
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,539
accordingly.

587
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,380
Dan: That's really cool to hear.
I feel like asking

588
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,369
questions is almost a skill to
learn as well. Sort of similar

589
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:40,664
to googling [laughs] is a skill
as a developer, you know? It

590
00:32:40,664 --> 00:32:42,959
sounds

591
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,890
everybody who is been a
developer for long enough knows

592
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,230
what that means, like, knows
what a person means when they

593
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,509
say that googling is a skill,
and you have to learn how to

594
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:55,380
google. Do you feel like you
have become better at asking

595
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,255
questions? Once, like--
especially once you start

596
00:32:57,255 --> 00:32:59,130
working with

597
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,430
maybe a company that value that,
you know, value that

598
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,630
interaction?

599
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,529
Drew: Yeah, absolutely. And- and
I would even say, I got

600
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,440
better at asking questions, even
while I was in that environment.

601
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,775
Because-- well, first, I want to
say, like me and that

602
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:18,150
developer,

603
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,359
we-- it was a really strange
relationship. Like, every- every

604
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:27,269
Friday, we would go grab lunch
together, we were best buds. And

605
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:29,204
we liked the same music. We were
both guitarist, and we would

606
00:33:29,204 --> 00:33:31,139
sit-

607
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,374
we would sit there-- you know,
we shared an office. It feels

608
00:33:33,374 --> 00:33:35,548
weird

609
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:37,724
to say that I shared a room with
anyone right now [laughs]. But,

610
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,899
you know, the

611
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,819
entire day, we would just sit
there and talk back and forth

612
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:44,549
like it was-- we really were
just friends. Friends inside-

613
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:47,279
inside

614
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,910
the company. But when it- when
it came to that, that- that was,

615
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,670
like, that was the only point of
friction in that relationship.

616
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,749
Which was- which was really
strange to me. But I think,

617
00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:55,828
it's--

618
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,920
the only thing I can chalk it up
to is that that's just how he

619
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,039
was. That was the company
culture. He was- he was trained

620
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:05,910
in and brought up in himself. So
that's the only way he knows to

621
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:14,010
try to help others learn. But,
yeah, I think even in that

622
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,039
environment, I think I got
better at asking questions.

623
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,179
Because I would- I would ask
something, and his response

624
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:25,079
would be like, "Well, what is-
what is x mean? What is y mean?"

625
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,245
I would use the wrong words all
the time, which is very

626
00:34:28,245 --> 00:34:30,090
frustrating.

627
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,349
Dan: Can you give an example of
that?

628
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,760
Drew: So, like, I would say
something like, you know,

629
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,670
"The-- this-- I'm passing this
argument, but it's not coming

630
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:43,889
out the right way," when what I
meant was the method, but I was

631
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:46,530
using the word argument. And his
response to be like, "Well,

632
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,539
obviously, that's not gonna
work. You don't need an argument

633
00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:51,134
there." "That's the--" I'd be
pointing at it on the screen,

634
00:34:51,134 --> 00:34:53,729
like, "That, right

635
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,184
there. That's what I'm trying to
do." He's like, "What? That's

636
00:34:55,184 --> 00:34:56,638
not

637
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,129
an argument." I'm like, "Okay.
Fair enough." So [laughs], like,

638
00:34:59,129 --> 00:35:02,070
that kind of stuff.

639
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:02,969
Dan: [Laughs] Yeah.

640
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,940
Bekah: Yeah. You know, we also
see, like, the issue

641
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:11,190
with entry level devs and the
problem of comfort level with

642
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,579
whoever they're working with.
And I have a lot of feelings

643
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,820
about that. But one of them also
is that not everybody is meant

644
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,515
to be a mentor, right? You know,
some people have, like, a

645
00:35:19,515 --> 00:35:21,210
natural

646
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,539
ability, some people can have
training and get good at it. But

647
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:28,380
some people, you know, they
don't desire it or they feel

648
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,380
like it takes away from their
experience. And so, they're

649
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:36,420
aggravated by it. But a company
not only has to make a space

650
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:40,860
welcoming for new developers,
but it also has to support the

651
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:45,000
upper level devs who are
providing the mentorship and the

652
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,845
guidance, and making sure that,
you know, that culture shows

653
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:50,639
that how you treat people and
talk to them.

654
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:54,349
Drew: Yeah. That's the-- so, one
of-- Sean, the guy

655
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:56,119
that I mentioned

656
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:00,289
earlier, he was always really
good at. If I ever came to him

657
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:05,030
with a question, he was-- his
response was always, you know,

658
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,815
"Well, let's look at it
together." Or, you know, "Let's

659
00:36:06,815 --> 00:36:08,480
talk me

660
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,760
through the steps you're trying
to do, and let's see if we can

661
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,869
find the hang up there." So I
think, he's one of those people

662
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:17,044
that just naturally has, like--
well, I mean, he's-- I know he's

663
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:19,219
been a

664
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:22,070
guitar teacher for a while. So
maybe he's just developed those

665
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,820
teaching skills.

666
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,639
Dan: Yeah. Going back to having
a company support the

667
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,239
senior devs in those roles, I
feel like that's an important

668
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:39,320
thing. I guess tying it back to
the framing of making it a rule,

669
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,769
like, having the rule of the one
hour thing, for instance, right?

670
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,545
That gives the younger
developer-- younger-- the-- you

671
00:36:45,545 --> 00:36:47,900
know, early

672
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:53,179
career, newer developer a
guideline to follow, right? But

673
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:57,590
it also implies that the
question should be asked, you

674
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,320
know? And that- and that the
question also should be, you

675
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,059
know, answered or whatever. So,
again, that has to become-- I

676
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:07,940
mean, you can just hope that the
senior developer in whatever

677
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:14,929
position is good at it and
everything, but having it be

678
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:17,659
part of the company culture,
having it be expected, you know,

679
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:21,860
that's part of a developer's
role is supporting a junior

680
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,980
developer or however it works
out. But that part of the

681
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,039
developer's job is doing that.
Not that answering a question

682
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:34,010
or helping a developer through a
problem is taking time away from

683
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:37,400
doing your job, right? I feel
like that can be something that

684
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,780
can come up, right? Where—if
it's not framed correctly—maybe

685
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:46,820
when you were asking a question,
he was just feeling like he had

686
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,550
stuff to do. And this was
getting in the way of doing his

687
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:53,539
stuff or something, you know?
And which is not actually

688
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:56,000
correct, right? Like, it's part
of his job. I mean, I don't know

689
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,305
what the exact situation was
there. But, like, it should be

690
00:37:57,305 --> 00:37:58,610
part of--

691
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,010
Drew: There was definitely a
lot- a lot of moving

692
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:05,630
projects with only one
experienced and one learning

693
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:06,349
developer.

694
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:10,949
Dan: Right. Right. Right. You
know, and not having it

695
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,980
explicit is a recipe for that
sort of thing to happen, you

696
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:21,000
know? You could maybe have be
lucky. That's what I mean,

697
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,355
like, depending on just hoping
[laughs]- hoping that it works

698
00:38:23,355 --> 00:38:25,710
out. It

699
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,800
doesn't-- that doesn't seem like
the right call. And hiring

700
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:34,230
junior developers is important.
But they need-- like, the people

701
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,640
hiring them need to be, you
know, prepared, right? Need to

702
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:41,550
be prepared to support them, but
also prepared to, you know, have

703
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,005
a plan for the senior developers
too. Because it's hard. It's

704
00:38:43,005 --> 00:38:44,460
also

705
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:51,510
another whole skill to learn.
And, you know, having some

706
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:54,389
guidelines like that, I feel
like is such a good- such a good

707
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,480
thing to, and sort of almost
easy thing to pull off, right?

708
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,489
Like, an easy way to really
improve the situation is just,

709
00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:01,349
like, this is how it works. Ask
a question, you know? [Laughs]

710
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:03,209
Like, ask

711
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,239
a question after an hour, you
know? Answer the question after,

712
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,460
you know, that when the junior
developer helps like it or

713
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,909
asks, you know? I just like
that. I like the clarity of

714
00:39:11,909 --> 00:39:12,539
that, you know? I think that's
really cool.

715
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,300
Drew: Yeah. And that actually
reminds me one- one

716
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,019
thing—before I knew about the
one hour rule—one thing Sean

717
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:22,590
always did to me that I didn't
know until I-- you know, months

718
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:26,550
and months later is that when I
would ask him a question, he

719
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,800
would- he would- he would set,
like, a timer, like, he'll reply

720
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,050
within

721
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:35,909
one hour if he doesn't hear back
from me. And I didn't know

722
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:38,250
that was the thing. So, like, I-
I just asked him a question, I

723
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,980
keep trying to work on it. And
then, there were a lot of times

724
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,440
where like, "Oh, nevermind. Got
it." And then, like, at-- what--

725
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,900
I think it

726
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,559
was after I'd left the contract
role with him, he's like, "Yeah,

727
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:51,119
I used to give you, like, an
hour anytime you ask a question.

728
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,679
And

729
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,150
towards the end, you got to
where you were responding back

730
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,590
within,

731
00:39:55,590 --> 00:40:00,570
like, 10 minutes that nevermind,
you found the answer." But

732
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,329
touching back on what you were
saying about companies needing

733
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:09,570
to, you know, like, proactively
support junior developers.

734
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,594
That's one of the things we're
doing on Protege. So, all of

735
00:40:11,594 --> 00:40:13,618
our--

736
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:18,989
all the listings there are
curated and, like, approved by

737
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:21,194
us. That's one thing-- when-
when a company lists with us,

738
00:40:21,194 --> 00:40:23,399
one

739
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:29,460
thing we gotta do-- one thing we
do is, you know, first, we read

740
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,469
through the listing and make
sure it kind of lines up with-

741
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,260
with the goals we have for
Protege. But then, we also kind

742
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,889
of like dig into the company's
website, and, you know, maybe

743
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:41,130
their LinkedIn, to try and get
an idea of the company culture

744
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:45,869
like. Are- are they posting this
role because they just

745
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:47,849
want to pay someone cheap? Or
are they posting this role

746
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:50,309
because they genuinely want to
find someone to build them up

747
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:56,550
into the best version that they
can be? And we try to- we try to

748
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,989
make sure we have a good idea
of- of- of the answer to that.

749
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,969
For- for every listing.

750
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,030
Dan: That's really cool. I
mean-- and that's, like-- I feel

751
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,960
like one of- one of the things
that makes Protege, you know,

752
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:15,809
special is the curation and the
sort of insight into the- the

753
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:18,719
junior developer mind, if you
will [laughs], you know?

754
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:21,629
It's—like you

755
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:26,190
said—it's not just a-- I don't
know, collection of- of things

756
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:29,130
that people want to find cheap
worker, you know, something like

757
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:29,849
that, right?

758
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:30,960
Drew: Yeah. I'm a--

759
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:31,829
Dan: It's really cool.

760
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,559
Drew: I will always refer to
myself as perpetually-

761
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,539
perpetually junior developer.
So, hopefully, I will always be

762
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:38,488
able

763
00:41:38,489 --> 00:41:42,570
to keep that mindset. But we
have-- I was actually just

764
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,639
talking to some people in the
Virtual Coffee group not too

765
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:49,619
long ago about- about some tools
and features we can add to,

766
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:53,760
hopefully, help empower both
sides of the process in our

767
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,019
interface to build.

768
00:41:55,829 --> 00:41:59,429
Bekah: So-- okay. So, if you had
a magic wand, and you

769
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:01,739
could get everything you want
for Protege, what does it look

770
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:02,099
like?

771
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:05,819
Drew: If I get everything I
want, in terms of features or

772
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,480
success?

773
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:09,090
Bekah: Whatever you want. Let's
do it all.

774
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,829
You've got a magic wand. It's
your choice.

775
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:15,239
Drew: If I had a magic wand,
there-- there'd be accounts for

776
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:19,829
both candidates and companies,
there'd be- there'd be tools on

777
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:26,670
both ends to do both empower and
protect both sides. I don't

778
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,349
really feel like the companies
would really need much

779
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:32,969
protection. But in some cases,
like, maybe the candidates do.

780
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:39,389
Especially from, you know, like,
ageism, or- or something like

781
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:43,289
that. Yeah, so some- some tools
around, like, empowering

782
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:45,659
candidates against
discrimination. So, like, maybe

783
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:48,014
there-- maybe only-- like, their
work history and, like, some

784
00:42:48,014 --> 00:42:50,369
kind

785
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:54,630
of like generic questions they
answered are available. And the

786
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:59,099
company can't really see what
their, you know, name- name,

787
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:03,150
gender, age, or location, or
anything like that is until, you

788
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:06,420
know, they schedule an interview
with them and have something

789
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,099
kinda like on the books or
something like that. Or even-

790
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,940
even a tool to where maybe
candidates can say, like, you

791
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,300
know, "I'm in this time zone,
but I'm willing to work in up to

792
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,890
these," are-- you know,
different stuff like that. I

793
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,480
haven't

794
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,250
looked at the, like, the company
side of a lot of the job board

795
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:29,880
competitors—which I don't really
consider them

796
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,515
competitors. Because, like,
they- they have their niche.

797
00:43:31,515 --> 00:43:33,150
They're

798
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,250
doing their thing, we're- we're
trying to solve a completely

799
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,219
different problem. So we'd
really just, like, all the tools

800
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:40,559
for everyone [laughs]. And
that's it.

801
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,429
Bekah: All right, excellent. I
mean, it is so hard

802
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:48,840
to search for a job as an entry
level or junior developer

803
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,269
because they don't make it
clear. Or you do have those

804
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:54,750
problems where they're like,
"Yes, we want an entry level

805
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,730
developer, but you have to know
all of these things," just

806
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,710
because

807
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,909
they want to get you to do work
for less money. And that's such

808
00:44:02,909 --> 00:44:05,639
a problem. And we see people
over and over going into those

809
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:10,650
environments and just being, you
know, totally frustrated, and

810
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:13,530
it's affecting their health
because it's such a terrible

811
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:19,170
place to work. But then, it's so
hard to find another job. But

812
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,960
it's just-- I don't know. It's
just this- this huge problem.

813
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:27,358
Drew: Yeah. Ideally, we want to
build a network of

814
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:31,259
companies that we know without a
shadow of a doubt, like, just

815
00:44:31,438 --> 00:44:34,949
support juniors, like, from the
ground up in every direction.

816
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:39,958
And that's- that's really what
we want for it is just, "Oh,

817
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:42,059
you're- you're a new candidate,
you're looking for a job. Okay.

818
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:46,048
Well, we know these 15 guys or,
you know, these 15 companies

819
00:44:46,048 --> 00:44:50,159
are- are hiring, and we have a
good working relationship with

820
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:53,458
all of them. And we know
regardless of where you end up,

821
00:44:53,909 --> 00:44:55,289
any of them are going to take
care of you."

822
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:58,630
Bekah: Yeah, that's so awesome.
And it's nice

823
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:02,739
to have connections with
communities where you can see

824
00:45:02,949 --> 00:45:05,739
junior developers who need jobs,
and you know that you can vouch

825
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:09,460
for them too, right? Like,
there's a difference. You'll get

826
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,159
the-- I'll get those Twitter
messages like, "Hey, I saw you

827
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:15,369
asked about your friend wanting
a dotnet job. I want one too.

828
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:17,364
Can you recommend me next?"
Like, "No [laughs]. I don't know

829
00:45:17,364 --> 00:45:19,359
you."

830
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:24,369
Drew: [Laughs] I actually just
had a-- I guess was kind of a

831
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:30,750
screening call last week with a
company that they just,

832
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:35,489
like, they hit me up on Twitter,
like, out of nowhere. And I

833
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:39,150
spent, like, the last 10 minutes
of that interview, like, talking

834
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:42,780
someone up from Virtual Coffee
because that referred them to

835
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:43,275
apply to the application. So,
like, the lady I was

836
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:47,400
interviewing

837
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:49,409
with, she's like, "Okay," she
was about to do, like, her

838
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,159
little goodbye speech. And I was
like, "Wait, before you go. Let

839
00:45:49,409 --> 00:45:55,409
me tell you about this person."
And I was like, "They do this,

840
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:59,309
they do this, they have this
experience. Look at their

841
00:45:55,409 --> 00:45:59,309
application. Forget about mine."

842
00:45:59,369 --> 00:45:59,940
Dan: Nice.

843
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:04,530
Bekah: Okay, so another thing I
want to talk

844
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:08,159
about-- because you are just
doing, like, stacks on stacks of

845
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:10,184
things. Okay. So, you're
building a career, you're

846
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,209
building a

847
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:17,309
community slash movement. And
it's an-- also an open source

848
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:20,369
project, and you're streaming
some of this. So you're, like--

849
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:23,249
okay, let me make this even more
difficult [laughs]. So, I'm

850
00:46:23,249 --> 00:46:26,009
going to add

851
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:28,800
the open source maintainer
thing, and I'm going to stream

852
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,590
it. So what was the idea behind
adding those components? And,

853
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,360
you know, I-- both I'm
interested in, like, how has

854
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,860
that been

855
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,880
challenging? But also, like, how
has that helped you as well?

856
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:45,050
Drew: Well, we decided to make
an open source because

857
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:49,610
we wanted a way-- well, one of
the questions we kept asking

858
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:53,690
ourselves early on was, like,
what can we do to let the

859
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,849
companies know that the
candidates they're considering

860
00:46:55,849 --> 00:47:01,699
here are, you know, worth- worth
the hire. And one of the ways

861
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:06,650
we thought we can do that was
make it an open source project

862
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:09,440
to where those candidates can
actually contribute to the

863
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,519
platform itself, you know? We-
we display anyone's who's

864
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:18,650
contributed to the project is--
on our contributors page. And

865
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:22,519
the idea behind that was that
companies could-- ideally, in

866
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:25,639
our heads is that played out,
companies come here, they- they

867
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:28,909
want to post a job. And then,
they see it on the contributors

868
00:47:28,909 --> 00:47:32,239
page that, "Oh, so there's
actually six applicants here

869
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,630
that have actively helped to
build the platform I'm listing

870
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:38,719
this job on," you know? Maybe-
maybe that'll help give them

871
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:42,440
some preference or something.
And even if it doesn't, then,

872
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:46,579
you know, we're doing our best
to- to help junior developers.

873
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:49,519
So even if it doesn't help in
that regard, it gives them the

874
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:55,369
opportunity to work on a real
world app that they can add to

875
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:58,820
their resume. I mean, even if
it's just, you know, I think

876
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,610
there's been some contributions
that were just accessibility

877
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:06,139
fixes. But, you know, that may
have just been, you know, from

878
00:48:06,139 --> 00:48:07,459
code perspective, all they did
was changed the Tailwind class.

879
00:48:07,459 --> 00:48:08,779
But,

880
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:13,909
you know, they also set up the
project locally, they also- they

881
00:48:13,909 --> 00:48:16,670
also, you know, at least have an
understanding of Git and how

882
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:21,920
that whole process works. So
that was- that was a lot of the

883
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,630
reasons why we decided to do
that. I decided to stream it

884
00:48:26,659 --> 00:48:33,440
because-- partly because I was
unemployed and bored, partly

885
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,610
because I wanted to force myself
into some accountability. So,

886
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:41,150
like, now, there's a lot of
people out there that know this

887
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:47,869
is a thing, so-- I don't want to
say they're depending on me, but

888
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,465
they know it's a thing. And if--
I'd feel really bad if I

889
00:48:50,465 --> 00:48:53,030
started

890
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,099
building this thing that was
gonna help the community and

891
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,049
then just, like, let it go. So
now, I have all these people

892
00:48:57,049 --> 00:48:58,999
that

893
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,275
know it's a thing, and they can
just say, "Hey, how's- how's

894
00:49:00,275 --> 00:49:01,550
that

895
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:03,874
going?" And my response can
never be, "Oh, I turned it off."

896
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,198
So,

897
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:07,880
that-- that's- that's never
gonna be a thing.

898
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,780
Dan: I like that idea of the
streaming for- for

899
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:16,099
accountability, you know? I
mean, the side project issue,

900
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:19,309
you know, of abandoning in or
not, or whatever. And you're

901
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:20,374
right. You're-- you already
have-- you have an audience of--

902
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,439
you

903
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,820
know, you have people coming in,
but that-- the- the streaming, I

904
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:30,739
feel like is- is a interesting
bit to add, just for, like, the

905
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:32,269
accountability part of it, you
know? I think that's really

906
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,799
cool.

907
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,409
Drew: Yeah, and there's- there's
actually parts

908
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:39,260
of the application now that
wouldn't exist if it wouldn't

909
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,829
have been for- for streaming
because I'd hit a bug or get

910
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:44,840
hung up on something that I
probably would have never found.

911
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:50,389
But there have been-- there been
people in the chat that were,

912
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,420
you know, helping me debug some
stuff. And if you look on the

913
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:59,150
contributors page, the last
three entries on it, it actually

914
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:02,150
just says special commit. Those
are there because those are-

915
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:05,269
those are three people that were
consistently there for, I think

916
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,340
the first two months. I was
working on building a stream to

917
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:12,409
pretty much every day. So those
three people were there for

918
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,179
probably 85% of that streaming
process. And we're doing a lot

919
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:19,519
of, like, you know, coaching or
problem solving with me through

920
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,859
the

921
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,275
chat. So that's what-- that's
why we put them up there. Yeah.

922
00:50:24,275 --> 00:50:26,690
And

923
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,199
we've had-- we haven't really
done much marketing for Protege.

924
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:34,670
I feel- I feel weird trying to
market a thing I built, but it's

925
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:35,734
kind of- kind of through
Twitter, and through streaming,

926
00:50:35,734 --> 00:50:40,340
and through a couple of other
communities. We-- we've somehow

927
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:45,679
managed to-- we average around
400 users per month, which, you

928
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,789
know, in the- in the larger
scale of Google Analytics

929
00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:53,119
probably isn't a whole lot. But
for- for something I started

930
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,869
building out of nowhere last
year with no marketing, I think

931
00:50:56,869 --> 00:51:01,340
that's pretty good numbers. So
we're really-- we have a phase

932
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,860
two. We're kind of like ramping
up for now, which is part of

933
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,995
next-- the next migration as
part of that. So we want- we

934
00:51:06,995 --> 00:51:10,070
want to

935
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:14,389
get those numbers up not because
we want, you know, good

936
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:20,360
analytic points or whatever the
business side of that is. But if

937
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,000
we can get that number up, then
that's more people that are--

938
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:26,420
that's just more people we're
helping or, you know, maybe it

939
00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:30,710
at least giving hope that, you
know, someone's out there doing

940
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,019
something on- on the behalf of
them.

941
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:37,710
Dan: Absolutely. And, you know,
the bigger community gets,

942
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:42,449
like, around that or audience or
whatever, you know? The more--

943
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,119
it's sort of exponentially
increases the exposure without

944
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:50,760
even doing ads or, you know,
anything specific did grow

945
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,400
it, you know? Yeah. That's
really cool.

946
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:54,780
Bekah: All right, Drew,

947
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:58,739
thanks for being here with us.
We really enjoyed having you.

948
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,739
And congratulations on
everything that you've done with

949
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:05,369
Protege, and for your one year
anniversary, or birthday, or

950
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:09,000
whatever you want to call it
going up. So, where can our

951
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,900
listeners find you?

952
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:16,409
Drew: You can find me on Twitter
@drewclemcr8,

953
00:52:16,409 --> 00:52:18,764
drew-clem-c-r-8 because, you
know, all the good handles are

954
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:21,119
taken.

955
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:26,159
You can find me-- I haven't been
streaming a lot lately because

956
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:31,679
of, you know, work and two kids.
But I'm on Twitch at

957
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:36,719
twitch.tv/ducky_87. I used to do
some gaming

958
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:39,869
streaming, like, four years ago,
and I just never changed the

959
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:46,559
handle. And now just kind of
like it. So-- and you can also

960
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:51,119
find me-- you can find me in the
Virtual Coffee sessions. Do you

961
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,760
ever want to pop in and join one
of those? Usually on Tuesdays. I

962
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,440
can't make-- I usually can't
make Thursdays.

963
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,679
Bekah: Yeah. And also there's
some open issues on Protege.

964
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:02,429
So, if you're interested in
contributing, it's a great

965
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,730
project. It's got a great
community behind it. And there's

966
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:09,389
lots of people there too,
willing to help and answer

967
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:13,889
questions. So, we're very glad
that you came here on this

968
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:16,260
podcast and that you've been
working on this project. So,
