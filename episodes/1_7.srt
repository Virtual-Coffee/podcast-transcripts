00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,710
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 1, Episode

2
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,859
7 of the Virtual Coffee podcast.
I'm Bekah, and this is

3
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,010
a podcast that features members
of the Virtual Coffee community.

4
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,519
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,989
stages of their coding journey.
And they're here, on this

6
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,459
podcast,

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,670
sharing their stories and what
they've learned. And we're here

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,750
to share it with you. Here with
me today is my co-host, Dan.

9
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:43,469
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. In this
episode, we talked to Colleen

10
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,100
Schnettler. Colleen is a Ruby on
Rails consultant who recently

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,670
launched her first product
called Simple File Upload. She's

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,719
also a career changer and a mom.
We discussed the challenges of

13
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,600
being a woman in the workplace,
the benefits of working for

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,170
yourself, and how difficult it
can be to learn to code in the

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,709
first place. It can take time
and commitment, but when you get

16
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,060
there, it will all be worth it.

17
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:08,819
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast

18
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,640
like we start every Virtual
Coffee. We introduce ourselves

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,604
with our name, where we're from,
what we do, and a random

20
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:15,568
check-in

21
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:20,280
question. Today's question is,
what movie can you watch

22
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,859
over and over without ever
getting tired of? We hope you

23
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:40,890
enjoy this episode. Hey, I'm
Bekah, I'm a front-end

24
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:45,659
developer from a small town in
Ohio. And if I could watch any

25
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:50,400
movie over and over, it would
depend on my mood and the genre.

26
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,884
But "The Sandlot and The
Princess Bride" are solid

27
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:52,109
choices.

28
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:54,120
Dan: Oh, yeah. Princess Bride,
it's really good.

29
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,324
I'm not-- Sandlot, I've never
been a huge fan of. Which

30
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:00,929
is, like-- I know, I

31
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,822
know it's-- I know. But it's
just, like, there's a mean dog.

32
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:02,714
And, I

33
00:02:02,715 --> 00:02:04,500
don't

34
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,549
know. It's just too much for me.

35
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,038
Bekah: The dog's not really
mean. Spoiler alert. [Laughs]

36
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,385
Dan: All right, well, [laughs]
maybe I should watch it

37
00:02:10,385 --> 00:02:11,120
again.

38
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:16,639
Hi, I'm Dan, I do front-end
development from Cleveland,

39
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:19,624
Ohio. My movie that I watch--
can pretty much watch anytime is

40
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:22,549
"The

41
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,130
Matrix", I guess. And also,
"Thor Ragnarok" more recently.

42
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,710
But

43
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,839
I've-- that movie came out,
what, four years ago? I don't

44
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:31,938
know

45
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:33,860
when it came out exactly. But I
think, I've watched it, like, 20

46
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,330
times, so [laughs]-- that's-- I
mean, it's a good-- I don't

47
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,800
know,

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,740
like, watched every

49
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,120
second of it. But I like it.

50
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:45,590
Colleen Schnettler: I'm Colleen.
I'm a Rails developer. I am

51
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,289
right now on the East Coast, but
about to move to the West Coast.

52
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:55,039
And a movie I could watch over
and over would be "Moana". I

53
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,520
mean, it's just like the perfect
movie. The music is amazing. The

54
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,449
story is amazing. It's funny. I
know I'm giving myself a way as

55
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,780
like having to have watched it a
million times. But I never get

56
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,229
sick of it.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,319
Dan: It is the perfect movie. My
kids have gotten sick of it.

58
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,889
Because I'm-- and yeah, we could
have a whole podcast about

59
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,034
movies that I've unwillingly
watched a million times

60
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:18,179
[laughs]. That's

61
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,130
a whole separate- separate
question. But "Moana" is

62
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,080
awesome.

63
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,460
Bekah: I feel like I need to go
back and watch

64
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,110
"Moana" again, cuz I think, I
fell asleep or got bored.

65
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:30,360
Dan: It's just so good. And, you
know, happy and-- I don't

66
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,800
know. It's good. I like it.

67
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,250
Bekah: I like the soundtrack. "I
am Mo..." Okay. We can cut

68
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,954
that. I don't mean-- I'm not
gonna sing. [Laughs] Anyway,

69
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:42,658
thanks for being here,

70
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:48,000
Colleen. We are super happy to
have you on the podcast. And

71
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,599
when we start off the podcast,
we just always like to

72
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,650
get the origin story of our
guests. So, you have quite an

73
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,560
origin story. You're a career
changer as well. But let's just

74
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,699
kind of start there. How'd you
get into software engineering?

75
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,250
Colleen: Sure. So my background
is actually in

76
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,990
electrical engineering. So, very
hard work, hardware focused. And

77
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,829
the first half of my career, I
worked at the shipyard-- at a

78
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,370
shipyard in Newport News, where
we were working on some of the

79
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,040
electronic systems surrounding
naval aircraft carriers. And I

80
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,870
ended up leaving that job to
stay home with my children. And

81
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,670
then I stayed home with the kids
for three or four years. And it

82
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,639
was around that time when I was
staying home when I was getting

83
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,290
ready to go back to work, that I
really, really wanted flexible

84
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:49,560
and remote work. And it's so
hard to find that. Even with an

85
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,689
engineering background. My
previous work had been so hands

86
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:57,959
on that there was no
opportunity—especially in

87
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,290
defense contracting—there was no
opportunity for me to do

88
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,670
that work remotely. And so I
started looking for other

89
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:10,379
opportunities. And I started
trying to teach myself to learn

90
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:14,870
to code. I released an iOS app,
which I

91
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:18,740
don't know that I've mentioned
before-- maybe I have. Anyway,

92
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:22,579
in, like, 2012—and it was a
disaster—and, like, the thing

93
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:27,139
hardly worked. I mean, you have
to pay Apple $100 a month to be

94
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:28,114
in their developer program. So--
yeah, right? [Laughs] So, it

95
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:33,649
was-- it didn't work

96
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:36,560
out the way I had hoped. I did
everything wrong. Like, I did

97
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:41,779
everything wrong with this iOS
app. But what I realized what

98
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:46,910
was-- there was a way I could
stay in my house, and work, and

99
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:50,569
get paid. And so, the process
took many, many, many years to

100
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:54,920
get where I am today, but I just
kind of started chipping away at

101
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:57,709
learning web development because
I saw that as an

102
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,129
opportunity for flexible remote
work.

103
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:04,240
Bekah: Yeah, that is awesome. I
think the

104
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:09,160
first CodeNewbie podcast I ever
listened to was your episode.

105
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,639
And it was so great because I
was like, "Okay," like, "Look,

106
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,860
look, she did this." And-- I
don't know. It gave me a lot of

107
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:17,049
confidence to keep moving
forward with my journey. So,

108
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:18,969
very

109
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,269
much appreciate you sharing your
story and being willing to talk

110
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:26,860
through that journey.

111
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,459
Colleen: That's awesome. I'm
glad you got

112
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:29,209
something out of it.

113
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,769
Bekah: I also like to ask
everybody their history

114
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:39,149
with Virtual Coffee. So, how did
you come to Virtual Coffee?

115
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,589
Colleen: So, I have forever been
looking for a

116
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:49,170
community with- with people on
the internet, right? Like, I'm-

117
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,980
I'm not great in big groups. I
love people. And I love

118
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,709
interacting with people. But,
like, if you put me in a Zoom

119
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,419
room with, like, 10 people or
more, I'm out. Like, I'm

120
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,129
mentally

121
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:01,319
checked out. Like, I just can't
really wrap my brain around

122
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,929
that. And so, I've actually
joined several groups--

123
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:06,539
internet,

124
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,830
internet groups. I don't know
what you call this [laughs].

125
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,120
Community is a better

126
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,290
word. I've joined several
communities. But the ones I've

127
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,889
joined, I've had two really
distinct problems. The first

128
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:20,699
problem is that it's just so
hard to foster authentic

129
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,259
connection on the internet with
large groups of people. It

130
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,819
just--

131
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,364
is, like, if you don't get to
know someone-- it's, just, I

132
00:07:25,364 --> 00:07:26,878
really

133
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,810
struggle with that. And the
second thing is I have joined

134
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,470
some paid communities. And
they're paid for, like-- because

135
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm trying to-- I'm starting a
business. So I've joined some of

136
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,709
those communities. And those are
more like highlight reels of

137
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,139
everyone's success. So it's
almost, like, people are just,

138
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,470
like, dropping in to tell you
how awesome they are and to

139
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,050
promote their product. And- and,
of course, we're all trying to

140
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,580
protect ourselves, right? I get
it. But it doesn't-- that

141
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,110
doesn't

142
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,329
do anything for me. I'm sure
you're doing great. That's

143
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:57,480
wonderful. But it's hard for me
to find-- really, until I found

144
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,240
you guys. You know, it was
just-- I didn't find a community

145
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,000
where

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,230
people were honest. And I think
we have pandemic. We're all at

147
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,730
home. We got our kids running
around, like, we need a space to

148
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,930
be honest.

149
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:17,850
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. And I
feel like I also

150
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,699
recruited you. I was like, "Oh,
you're super cool."

151
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,020
Colleen: Oh, yeah. That's too.
You actually did.

152
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,310
Like, I hate that I'm so

153
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,220
high maintenance that you had to
recruit me. Like- like, I saw

154
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,709
you on Twitter talking about it.
And I was like, "I should do

155
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,620
that." But, like, I was just so
overwhelmed by the current

156
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,435
demands on my time. Like, it was
just, like-- I cannot-- I can't

157
00:08:33,435 --> 00:08:35,250
do

158
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,345
another-- I was like, "I can't
do another Slack group. I can't

159
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:37,440
do

160
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,110
another fake community." No
offense. I didn't know at the

161
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,500
time. It was, like, I can't do
another group of people that

162
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,220
don't really, like- like,
connect. And you did. You sent

163
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,730
me a message and asked me
specifically. So, again, I'm

164
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,025
sorry. I'm such a pain that you
had to told me in. But after you

165
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:55,320
did,

166
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,600
it's been really great. And I
really appreciate you reaching

167
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:59,309
out and inviting me.

168
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:02,038
Bekah: Yeah, no. I'm very glad
you're here,

169
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:06,328
obviously, because I reached out
and made sure that you came

170
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:12,479
because I wanted you here too.
So, yeah. I'm glad that I did

171
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:12,839
that.

172

173
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,649
Dan: That's- that's really
interesting. The point you were

174
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:19,860
making about there was the
private community where, you

175
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,370
know, the highlight reel thing,
you know, as you termed it,

176
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,696
right? The-- everybody's
always-- I don't know. They--

177
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:25,993
motivation

178
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:28,589
for sharing your

179
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:38,220
successes is I suppose fairly
clear, you know? But the-- you

180
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,419
know, I found- I found similar--
I've found-- I've had similar

181
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,879
issues with community—online
communities—where I've just

182
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,089
never really connected, you
know, as well. And the highlight

183
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,299
reel

184
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,179
thing is aspect that I-- I've
never liked, framed it that way.

185
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,554
Like, the-- you want to be able
to share your wins, you know,

186
00:09:57,554 --> 00:10:00,388
and

187
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:04,919
get high fives or whatever. But-
but the fact that, like, you'd,

188
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,074
like, being very honest and
shared-- being able to share,

189
00:10:06,074 --> 00:10:07,168
you

190
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:10,769
know? I don't know. I don't like
saying failures, you know? But,

191
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:15,990
like, not wins, you know?
Hardships and struggles, you

192
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,805
know, things like that, I see
it's something that sort of

193
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:19,620
happened

194
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,159
naturally here. But it is-- I
mean, it is one of the, like,

195
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:26,669
things that we- we very much
value, and I think, really does,

196
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,429
you know, make Virtual Coffee
unique [laughs].

197
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,549
Colleen: Well, I think the thing
that's- that's

198
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:33,919
important to remember is, it's
because of the leadership team.

199
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,350
Which is you guys. I mean,
Bekah'll drop in some, like,

200
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,450
super

201
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,010
personal stuff. And I'm like,
"Whoa." Like, your midweek

202
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,570
check-in.

203
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,000
It was, like, a couple months
ago, you, like, drop this, like,

204
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,844
super personal midweek check-in.
And I was like, "Oh," like,

205
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,629
"This

206
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:49,084
is a real midweek check-in,"
like, "We're actually gonna be

207
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:50,539
honest.

208
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,444
Okay, I can do that." But I'm
just not-- I think, guys, too,

209
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,288
for

210
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:57,409
me, like, I've been a woman in
engineering for, like, 20 years

211
00:10:57,409 --> 00:10:59,644
now. Minus the four years I was
home. And so, I am super,

212
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:01,879
super--

213
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:04,250
because the way I've been
treated in the past, like, just

214
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:10,220
honestly, I'm super protective
of myself and my abilities. And

215
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,240
I think that mostly I—because of
that—I always try to present

216
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,019
myself a very specific way
because I feel so judged all the

217
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:22,669
time. And that's just a
culmination of 10 years working

218
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:26,539
in an office and just having to
deal with that. And so, I have

219
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:28,174
this really-- like, I don't know
if you say chip on my shoulder,

220
00:11:28,174 --> 00:11:29,809
I'd

221
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:33,139
rather say defense mechanism.
But I have this, like, really

222
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:36,259
serious shield in front of me.
So I'm not going to go into a

223
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:38,059
group. And these groups I'm in
are all men, too, mostly. Like,

224
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:39,859
the

225
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,345
paid community I'm in [laughs],
there's, like, maybe five other

226
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:42,830
women.

227
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:48,080
And so, you know, I really
always have those shields up,

228
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,220
because I feel like I'm just
judged differently. Whether it's

229
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,289
true or not, I don't know. But
it's just my perception.

230
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,018
Bekah: No, I feel that so much.
And I think it-- for

231
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,299
me, this is [laughs] a very new
experience sharing very open

232
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,529
things about myself. Because I
spent a lot of years, like, with

233
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:10,470
the shield up and doing exactly
what you're saying. And then, at

234
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,409
one point, I just-- I couldn't
anymore because of what I had

235
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:16,529
gone through, like, it was a
breaking point. And so, I was

236
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:19,049
like, well, you know, I went
from sharing nothing to, like,

237
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,679
here, here is everything. Like,
I will just hand you my heart

238
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:26,370
and do what you want with it.
And I'm gonna keep moving on.

239
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,269
But, you know, you said
something too about, like,

240
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:33,210
communities can be really
exhausting online as well,

241
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,509
right? Like, it's one more thing
to do, right? And I think that

242
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:38,999
you find the good community when
you are like, "Okay, this

243
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:41,489
isn't--

244
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,539
These are- these are people who
support me as a person. And

245
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:48,194
they- they are interested in me
as a human being, not as-- like

246
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:50,579
a

247
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,519
possible consumer," or, you
know, as this- this one thing

248
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,918
that

249
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,830
separates you from your
humanity. And it's really hard

250
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,845
to find, but really great when
you do find it. That kind of

251
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:04,860
like

252
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:07,470
you touched on some of the
things I wanted to get started

253
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,470
with, too. It's like the--
you're doing a lot of things,

254
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,470
right?

255
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,649
You are an independent
contractor, you're a podcaster,

256
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:21,149
you're building this- this tool.
You're a career changer, you're

257
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:25,710
a mom, like, first of all,
that's amazing. Second of all,

258
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,580
how do you stay motivated to do
all of these things?

259
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:35,610
Colleen: I don't know. Honestly,
I don't know if

260
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,940
I'm doing the right thing. Like,
I wonder about it all the time.

261
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,450
A different community I'm in,
which is has been great as a

262
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,809
group of consultants. And we
talked about this a lot because

263
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:49,200
there's a lot of consultants who
have moved to full time

264
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,330
employment, because I'm sure you
guys have had this experience as

265
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,759
well. Like, you contract for
someone, and then they offer you

266
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,844
a job. And every time, I'm like,
"Do I want to take it, or not

267
00:13:55,844 --> 00:13:57,929
want

268
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:01,019
to take it?" Like, it just seems
so comfortable to have a regular

269
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:03,749
job. And then, I'm like, "Oh,
but flexibility." And so I, you

270
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:06,479
know,

271
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,009
I do question these decisions. I
think about a year ago, I really

272
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:15,330
got focused on trying to figure
out what I wanted, like, long

273
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,110
term. "What do I want?" Not what
do I want next year, but, like,

274
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,429
"what do I want for the rest of
my life as a career?" And when I

275
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:28,440
go back to wanting that flexible
remote work, the real reason I

276
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,220
started coding, flexible, remote
work, obviously. But I've always

277
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,740
wanted my own business. Like,
I've always wanted to be

278
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,570
completely independent. So the--
starting a product is really

279
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,809
hard because it's slow, and you
don't know what you're doing,

280
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:46,379
and, like, it's just a whole
thing [laughs]. So I have one--

281
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,529
Bekah: So you have a podcast on
it.

282
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:49,639
Colleen: Literally, the reason
we started the

283
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,804
podcast was so I would not quit.
Like [laughs], that's the only

284
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:55,969
reason. But that's always been
my

285
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,960
goal and I know why I want that.
And once I was able to really

286
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,460
define for myself what my goal
was, it made staying

287
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,899
motivated so much easier.
Because before, my goal was kind

288
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:11,990
of nebulous. It was like, "Oh, I
just want to work flexibly and

289
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,860
remote." Okay. And then, it was
like, "Oh, I just want to," you

290
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,485
know, "make money." And
something Saron Yitbarek—the

291
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:21,110
founder of

292
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:27,350
CodeNewbie—said to me once was,
"What are you optimizing for?"

293
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,690
And that's my favorite question.
Because, like, long term, this

294
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,919
is our life. So, what are you
optimizing for? So I know that

295
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,379
my goal is to get a product off
the ground. I know the only way

296
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:40,129
to get a product off the ground
is to do all these things. I

297
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:42,319
mean, obviously, it'll be great
if my product made enough money,

298
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,350
I didn't have to consult. But
that's, like, many years off. So

299
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,740
[laughs], you know, just trying
to get through it.

300
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,470
Dan: That- that idea of
optimizing, thinking about

301
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,090
things in that- in that
framework is something that I

302
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,539
came across, I don't know, a
while ago. But it helped me the

303
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:07,100
same way. I've been independent
for a long time. And there have

304
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,030
been times- there have been
times where I've considered

305
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,960
either

306
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,200
applying or taking jobs. And
it's the same thing. I'm not

307
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,700
optimized for making money, you
know, like, for instance, right?

308
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,730
That is not my main-- I need to
make money, like, I need to

309
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,539
support my family, you know? Or
help, you know, help support my

310
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:27,769
family. And I need to pay bills,
and things like that. But- but

311
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:31,039
the- the main thing I'm
optimizing for is that-- making

312
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,340
money, right? Otherwise, there's
other decisions, you know, I

313
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,439
could have made, right? And
there was-- there came a time in

314
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:38,538
my-- I

315
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,600
think, in my mid- late 20s or
something where I had one of

316
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,934
those, "What am I doing with my
life," you know? "What am I

317
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:44,268
doing

318
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,320
with my career moments?" And I
think that- that question helped

319
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,519
me a lot to help me become
comfortable with staying

320
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,759
independent, you know, keeping
the flexibility. I like the

321
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,729
flexibility and the-- you know,
both in- in time, and allow me

322
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:01,699
to

323
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,159
follow my nose. Sort of
[laughs]- sort of a strange

324
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:06,618
phrase, but, like, you

325
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:13,700
know-- I lost track of what I
was saying. The-- what are you

326
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,980
optimizing for is a great
question to ask yourself

327
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,329
though, in pretty much any- any
decision you're trying to make.

328
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,130
I think it's a great way to
think about it.

329
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:24,910
Bekah: So, that's where I'm
going to be the rest

330
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,724
of the day. Trying to figure out
what I'm optimizing for

331
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:28,538
[laughs]. Like, "What am I

332
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:35,529
doing?" Can we even do the rest
of the podcast now? The other

333
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:38,769
thing, too, about being
independent is, it allows you to

334
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:42,400
avoid some-- so many workplace
challenges, right? Like, I don't

335
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,630
know, I don't really like
playing politics in the office.

336
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,380
That's been a challenge for me
in past jobs. And it's been nice

337
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,250
to not have to deal with that
kind of stuff. So, have you

338
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,440
found that as a perk?

339
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,880
Colleen: Oh, yeah. I have so
much to say about this.

340
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,509
Okay. I promise I won't
[laughs]- I won't go too long.

341
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:04,009
But-- so, when I was young-- so,
I'm at a college, you know? I'm

342
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:05,509
the

343
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:10,609
only woman working at this
company. I learned quickly that

344
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,289
at- at any big business—this was
a fortune 500 company—so a

345
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:13,848
big

346
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:16,609
business. There are people who
get the good work, and people

347
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:19,849
who get the crappy work. And the
people who get the good work are

348
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,379
typically the people who are in
the in-crowd, right? There's

349
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:22,909
all-

350
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,309
there's all this, like, the
in-crowd of the smart people,

351
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,359
and then the hanger-oners. So I
quickly learned, like, the way

352
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,460
to get into the in-crowd is to
be liked. And this ended up

353
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,720
serving me poorly for, like, the
next 10 years. Because somehow

354
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,160
throughout my career, I learned,
"Okay. So my goal is to get in

355
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,190
the in-crowd, so I get the good
work." But there was a lot of

356
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,970
other weirdness that came with
that being the only woman on my

357
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,920
team. Just a lot of weird, you
know, uncomfortable things that

358
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,109
came with that. Trying to always
be nice. And trying to laugh at,

359
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:02,359
like, the microaggression. I
didn't even know those were

360
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:05,029
microaggressions. I don't think
we had a word for it 15 years

361
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:08,599
ago. But, like, just so much of
that. And what I didn't

362
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:11,089
realize while I was going
through this, like, playing work

363
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:14,180
politics, trying to be like,
laughing at the jokes that, you

364
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,180
know, about some woman who got
promoted cuz she was a woman.

365
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:20,509
Like, what I didn't realize is
that was slowly chipping away

366
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:25,549
at, like, my self-worth. And I
didn't- I didn't even realize

367
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:28,430
that until- until now. Like,
looking back, like, 15 years

368
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,649
later, right? And so, I really
think I hate office politics

369
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:32,868
[laughs].

370
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,849
I mean, like, so I'm out. Like,
I'm not doing that anymore. If I

371
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:36,318
went

372
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,470
back to a job, like, I would
never put up with that now,

373
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,529
right? Like, I would never laugh
at those jokes. I would never,

374
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,935
like, take-- not respond to some
of the ways I was treated now,

375
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,160
you

376
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,930
know, in my late 30s. But in my
20s, I just didn't know. So

377
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,494
this combination of, like,
office politics and gender

378
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:59,058
politics is

379
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:01,910
like-- oh, it was awful. And I
hope it's better. But I think

380
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,890
it probably depends on where you
work, you know, in terms of how

381
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,059
that how that goes.

382
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:14,150
Bekah: Oh, for sure [laughs].
Got so much to say about

383
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,589
that too. But that is, you know,
that's super frustrating, and

384
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,028
too--

385
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,450
you're younger coming into this
industry as well. And I know,

386
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,289
like, that was also an issue.
Being a young woman in an

387
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,799
industry, it can be really
challenging. I don't know how

388
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,430
many times I got comments that
were super inappropriate. You

389
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,900
wouldn't say to a man in that
same situation. But I always had

390
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,309
to deal with, you know, me being
young and me being a woman. And

391
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:44,630
that was just—for a long time—it
was-- well, that's just the

392
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,829
way things are, so you do kind
of laugh it off or whatever. But

393
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:52,549
now-- yeah. There's- there's no
way that I stand for that now.

394
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,859
But also, I've been through
enough situations where I feel

395
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:03,559
like, "You know what? I don't
care what happens if I respond

396
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,689
to this strongly because I'm
done. And it- and it doesn't

397
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:07,819
matter."

398
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:10,084
But certainly, 10 years ago,
that's-- I was not nearly in

399
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:12,349
this place.

400
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,380
Colleen: Yeah.

401
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,670
Dan: Yeah. That-- the- the
question of, like, how to

402
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,569
respond with things like that,
what I was gonna say was the

403
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:26,314
advice-- like, if you have
advice for somebody who is

404
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:28,369
young, new

405
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:30,034
career, and can't afford to,
maybe burn bridges-- not burn

406
00:21:30,034 --> 00:21:31,699
bridges,

407
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,059
but can't afford to just quit
their job, right? Because

408
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:36,784
they're supporting their family
or their-- you know, the only

409
00:21:36,784 --> 00:21:38,509
one

410
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:40,309
making money, you know, with
their family and stuff like

411
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:45,440
that. Like, what-- how do you--
how would you try to give your

412
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,075
past selves advice, I guess,
maybe in this- in this

413
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:48,710
situation?

414
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,920
Or how would you give somebody
who is coming out of college

415
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,400
and joining the industry here,
or coming out of high school

416
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,549
even, you know, as a young
woman, like, entering this? And

417
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:00,574
if they have these-- if they end
up having experiences like

418
00:22:00,574 --> 00:22:02,599
this,

419
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,280
you know? Because I'm sure that
plenty of women still are-- I

420
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,930
know

421
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,900
that plenty of women still are.
What would you tell-- like, what

422
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,940
would be your advice to- to
somebody who's found themselves

423
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,970
in a situation like that, as a
young- as a young developer? If

424
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,359
anything [laughs].

425
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,630
Colleen: I don't really know,
honestly. Which is

426
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,180
terrible. Like, you know, I just
feel like-- my thoughts are, if

427
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,730
I

428
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,455
could go back and talk to
myself, right? It's, like, you

429
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:29,180
think

430
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,769
it's okay. Like, you think these
are small. But, like, these-

431
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:32,358
these

432
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:35,630
microaggressions, like, they
compound, and they will impact

433
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,680
you long term so much more than
you can realize now at 22/23

434
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,609
years old. So, you know, you're
not going to get fired for

435
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:45,169
standing up to that person. It
could end-- I mean, it could

436
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:46,729
not--

437
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:51,859
it might not end great for you.
I ended up in one job with a

438
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:55,819
company I won't name. I
complained about my mentor,

439
00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:00,589
mentor who was treating me
poorly. And I got reassigned,

440
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:03,049
and he got promoted. Like, it
was terrible [laughs]. So, you

441
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,509
know, when I

442
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:09,829
finally stood up for myself,
that's what happened. And so

443
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:13,609
that obviously left a terrible
taste in my mouth. But I would-

444
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,250
I would also say that, like, you
think it's okay to let them go,

445
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,430
don't- don't let it go. Because
it's gonna compound, and it's

446
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,549
gonna come back to bite you, and
you're not gonna get fired.

447
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:24,440
Like, you might have something,
like, happen to me where you

448
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,369
might get reassigned. Look for a
new job. Like, keep looking,

449
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:33,500
like, don't give up. And just-
just fight back because that BS

450
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,680
is exhausting. And it will just-
it will just eat it-- you over

451
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,039
time.

452
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,839
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. I would--
I totally agree

453
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:43,809
with that. And I think that, you
know, that look for a new job

454
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:45,249
thing is super important.
Because I know people that--

455
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:46,689
well,

456
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,750
it wasn't that big of a deal, or
these other things about this

457
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,049
company are good, or it's hard
to find work. But, like, the

458
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:56,049
minute that something like that
happens, and if you reported to

459
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:59,349
HR to a supervisor, and they
blow you off, then you know what

460
00:23:59,349 --> 00:24:02,650
kind of company you're working
for, right? It's not just one

461
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,195
thing. This is a company
culture. And so, it is

462
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:05,740
definitely

463
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,579
time to start looking for
something new. And I don't-- I

464
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:15,670
think I have a couple of
thoughts, too. But one is,

465
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:21,819
having somebody who is an ally
or a support person at your

466
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:27,309
company can be really useful.
So, you know, I was on this

467
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:32,170
committee, and I-- every time I
spoke, I was interrupted by one

468
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:37,569
of the older men in the meeting.
It was frequently happened. And

469
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:39,129
I didn't even realize that it
was happening. And then,

470
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:40,689
somebody

471
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,690
else pointed out to me that,
"Hey, he doesn't interrupt any

472
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,119
of the men when they speak. He
only interrupts you and the

473
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,419
other women." And having the-
the man who pointed this out to

474
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:52,719
me

475
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,950
say something, then it was
recognized, right? And it's a

476
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,430
shame. It should not have to
happen that way. But definitely

477
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,905
having, like, allies who can
stand up for you and say, like,

478
00:25:02,905 --> 00:25:05,380
"Let's

479
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,910
not do this," is really, really
important too.

480
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:13,900
Dan: So you have been ... I'm
sorry. Can you remind me how

481
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,119
long you've been-- you've been
independent now for--

482
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:16,960
Colleen: Four years.

483
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,250
Dan: Four years now? Have you
run into any, like, similar

484
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,779
issues since you've been
independent? Or--

485
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:28,389
Colleen: Nope. So, one thing I
have to say ... that is

486
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:33,069
awesome. Yeah. I have had no
problems working for myself. I

487
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:36,490
think, it's a combination of a
few things. I think, you know,

488
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,119
the world and the conversation
is changing around this issue.

489
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:44,079
I'm in the Rails community. And
I can't speak to the other

490
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,779
communities, but, like, the Ruby
and the Rails community is

491
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:51,910
spectacular. Just the most
inclusive, welcoming community.

492
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,690
I mean, I will never forget. I
went to my first Rails meetup

493
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,529
several years ago. And the guy
who was running the meetup is

494
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:04,269
like a super senior developer.
And I was coming off of my

495
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:07,299
previous experience, so that
story I told you about the guy

496
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,359
getting promoted and me getting
reassigned, that's when I quit

497
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,709
my job to stay home with my kids
[laughs]. Cuz I was like, "I'm

498
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:13,059
done.

499
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:16,960
I can't do this anymore." So I'm
coming off of, you know, that

500
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,539
bad work experience. I was
coming off of being a stay at

501
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:22,509
home mom. I was really, like,
just struggling. I didn't know

502
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:28,029
what I was doing. Self teaching
is hard. And I remember I met

503
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:29,319
him, and he's, like, super
senior, like, kind of well known

504
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,609
in the

505
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:36,160
community. And, like, he treated
me like an equal. And that

506
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,359
hadn't happened to me in so
long. And then people just kept

507
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,819
doing that to me. Like, they
just treated me like a human.

508
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:44,769
And it was this-- it was- it
was, like, it was amazing. Like,

509
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,719
it

510
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,309
was just so amazing. And that
community is amazing. And I

511
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,670
think also being independent,
like, I don't have to work on

512
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,655
your team if I don't like you.
So [laughs] that's been really

513
00:26:57,655 --> 00:27:00,940
great too. So, yeah.

514
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,259
Dan: Yeah, just another- another
bonus for being

515
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,099
independent, right?

516
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,599
Colleen Yeah. You have so much
freedom. You can

517
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,839
pick your clients, you can pick
your teams. I mean, I've worked

518
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:15,940
on some spectacular teams. And
it's because I have a lot of

519
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,940
choice. I can hire people or I
can work with my friends who are

520
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,769
hiring people, like, it's a
win-win.

521
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:25,460
Bekah: Yeah. So, you mentioned
Saron earlier, and

522
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,258
I had a tweet from her pulled up
because she said something--

523
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:31,939
she tweeted this recently, on
February 1st. But she said, "I

524
00:27:31,939 --> 00:27:33,619
was

525
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,900
reflecting on my experience." I
shouldn't even read this aloud

526
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,210
because she's got such a great
voice. And I hear it in my head,

527
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,605
and I'm gonna read it. Anyway
[laughs]-- I'm not gonna read

528
00:27:39,605 --> 00:27:41,000
them to

529
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,230
summarize. She was reflecting on
her experience in tech and

530
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,980
saying how positive it's been,
right? And she knows that

531
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,910
there's toxicity and problems
out there. And then, she

532
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,910
realized "I've spent most of my
career working for myself" is

533
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:00,589
what she said. And I think, it
does make a huge difference.

534
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:05,900
Because you- you don't have to
play those- those politics. You

535
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:12,380
have the ability to be flexible
and to change things. And-- I

536
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:18,380
don't know. I- I have this
feeling when something is

537
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,239
unfair or unjust at this point
in my life, I'd like to-- just,

538
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:22,038
like,

539
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:26,420
yell about it really loud until,
like, somebody responds to me.

540
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,240
And I know people feel weird,
like, "Well, you shouldn't name

541
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,190
names," or whatever, like, I
have the- I have the ability to

542
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,140
name

543
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,420
names. And- and I will, you
know? It's not-- and I think

544
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,700
that

545
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,630
also, you know, people who have
that ability and can do that,

546
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,130
that's also really helpful for
everybody else trying to, you

547
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:49,160
know, make their way and falling
into these situations.

548
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,240
Colleen: Yeah.

549
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:54,170
Bekah: So, I think, can we just
jump back a little

550
00:28:54,170 --> 00:29:00,650
bit to your career? So, you've
worked into male dominated

551
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:06,470
industries. And that's got to be
a challenge. Like, did you think

552
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:10,519
about that at all when you were
moving from engineering to tech?

553
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:13,910
Like, "Oh, well. I'm moving from
this industry, and maybe the

554
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,859
experience will be similar in
this other one?"

555
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,460
Colleen: So, there is no other
job where you can make

556
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,609
the kind of money we can make. I
mean, think of what we do, guys.

557
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:26,630
We have paid, like, a kind of
absurd amount of money to, like,

558
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,230
work six hours a day in our home
office, you know? Like, when you

559
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,269
hit this point, it is just,
like, I cannot-- I remember

560
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:34,308
trying to

561
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:36,199
build-- so, I tried, I didn't
ever get a job. So, I was

562
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:38,089
self-taught.

563
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,409
I applied for that Flatiron
scholarship, like, three years

564
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:40,699
in

565
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,779
a row. I never got it. I still
love you, Bekah. Even though you

566
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:45,980
got my scholarship, it's fine
[laughs]. It worked out.

567
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,470
Bekah: Sorry [laughs].

568
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:51,869
Colleen: I remember when I was
trying to get

569
00:29:51,869 --> 00:29:56,339
started, it was just so hard.
And then I remember talking to

570
00:29:56,339 --> 00:29:58,859
people, and they were like, "You
should get a job before you go

571
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:01,980
independent." And they were
totally right. My advice would

572
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,670
be whether you're a bootcamp
student or you are self-taught,

573
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,575
your number one goal should be
to get, like, a real- a real

574
00:30:07,575 --> 00:30:09,450
job.

575
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,480
Get a full time job. Because
that's how you're going to get

576
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,619
the growth and the mentorship.
But I was never in a position to

577
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:19,589
do that. Like, my husband's gone
all the time, I had three

578
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:23,339
little kids, like, I have to be-
I have to be available. I didn't

579
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:28,650
have 40 hours a week to work. So
trying to, like, build- build

580
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,609
this business to where I am now,
like, was so hard. And if I look

581
00:30:32,609 --> 00:30:35,789
back to, like, five years ago,
like, I literally cannot even

582
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:40,289
imagine myself in this position.
But despite it being a male

583
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:43,829
dominated field and like it—you
know, I like men just fine.

584
00:30:43,829 --> 00:30:46,019
Like, I don't mean to, like,
hate on men. I've just had some

585
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:51,869
really bad experiences. I mean,
our job is amazing. Like, we- we

586
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:55,980
can work from home, we get paid
really well, we do things that,

587
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,080
like- like, impact the entire
world. Like, not to sound

588
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,180
cheesy,

589
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,269
but, like, the internet runs the
world, and we control the

590
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:05,834
internet. It's amazing [laughs].
Oh, my gosh. I showed, like--

591
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:08,399
so, my

592
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,660
family is not at all excited
about web development. I don't

593
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,700
know why. But I showed- I showed
them the other day, like, one of

594
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,289
their- one of their friends was
having a problem with his, like,

595
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,440
e-commerce site or something.
And I, like-- I just pulled up a

596
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,104
console and change the CSS,
like, in the console so they

597
00:31:27,104 --> 00:31:28,768
could see

598
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:30,314
it live. And they were just
like, "Oh, my gosh. This is

599
00:31:30,314 --> 00:31:31,859
amazing!" [Laughs]

600
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,869
I was like, "You're welcome."
Like, this is fun [laughs].

601
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:39,869
Bekah: I felt like I made it
once when my dad

602
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:43,529
called me and he was like, "Is
this the expected behavior of

603
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:46,094
this form?" [Laughs] That is
not-- that should not be

604
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:48,659
happening.

605
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:57,210
It's validated. [Laughs] Yeah.
Okay. So you have this

606
00:31:53,849 --> 00:32:01,230
really long process that you've
gone through. And it sounds like

607
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,529
you're- you're- you're happy
with where you are. But, you

608
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:05,818
know, is

609
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:07,410
it worth it for such a long
process to get there?

610
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:10,359
Colleen: I just wish-- okay. So,
my thoughts on

611
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,859
this, I

612
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:15,640
just wish the messaging was
better on how to become a

613
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,210
software developer. I think that
I'm going through the same thing

614
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:22,660
now that I'm trying to start a
software business, like, the

615
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,529
messaging is just bad on the
internet. And I feel like, five

616
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:29,890
years ago, like, it was the same
way when you're trying to learn

617
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,714
to code. So, yes. The answer--
the TL;DR is yes. It's 100%

618
00:32:33,714 --> 00:32:37,538
worth it.

619
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,430
But it is a slog. Like, when you
are either working full time or

620
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,250
whatever you're doing, like,
especially if you have kids at

621
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,890
home, and of course, we're in a
pandemic, so that makes it all

622
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:52,390
the more complicated, it's just
a slog. I used to have this

623
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:55,539
process where while I was doing
the dishes, I would listen to

624
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:59,049
the CodeNewbie podcasts, like,
to get me pumped to go work all

625
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:04,329
night, right? To try to learn
something. And I-- like, I was

626
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:07,750
trying to learn something. And,
you know, I thought I was good

627
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,258
enough. And then, I tried to do
open source, and I realized that

628
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:14,529
I was not good enough. And, you
know, what happened to me is I

629
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:18,579
just, like, there was this one
issue I could not sorted out.

630
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:24,519
And I probably just- just, like,
sat on it for, like, six months.

631
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:27,069
Like, I just stopped, and, like,
didn't-- you know, it's open

632
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:31,119
source. No one's asking me. And
this guy, like, who was one of

633
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,619
the maintainers just-- all he
did was send me, like, an email.

634
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:34,119
And

635
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:37,059
he was like, "Hey, do you need
some help on this issue?" And

636
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:39,459
that? That changed everything
for me. Like, one person reach

637
00:33:39,459 --> 00:33:41,859
out, I

638
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:45,700
would not have made it. Like, I
was- I was out. Like, one person

639
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,960
reaching out, like, change the
trajectory of my whole life.

640
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,835
Like, it's so cool. So, I'm
ranting a little bit, [laughs]

641
00:33:51,835 --> 00:33:53,710
but I

642
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,644
guess my-- what I'm trying to
say here is, like, it's a slog.

643
00:33:55,644 --> 00:33:57,578
So

644
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:00,430
don't believe-- there's so many
stories on the internet that are

645
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:03,970
like, "I learned to code in six
months, and now I make $130,000

646
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,079
a year." No. Lies. It's lies.
Like, no. It's a slog. It takes

647
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,158
a long

648
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,829
time. But when you are on the
other side, like, it's amazing.

649
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,610
Because we are-- we have-- I can
work from home, I can back when

650
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:25,030
there was a bus, I could take my
kids to the bus, like, I can

651
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:29,889
pick them up, like, I can do all
those things. And, you know,

652
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,980
you're gonna make pretty good
money doing it. So, absolutely

653
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,619
worth it. But be prepared for it
to take years.

654
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:41,019
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, that's-- I
mean, the- the self-taught path,

655
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,894
you know ... that's always-- the
one when I say to you, it's

656
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:44,709
really hard to

657
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:49,449
say, I think, out loud. It's
nice to hear you say that. It is

658
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:52,269
hard. It's hard, no matter what
path you're taking, and if

659
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:55,599
you're not doing it full time,
like, you know, if you have kids

660
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,050
or another job you trying to
change. It does. It takes a long

661
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,715
time, but you'll get there and
then it's, like, once you get

662
00:35:00,715 --> 00:35:02,380
to--

663
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:07,239
I don't know, as I imagined, the
time is different. But there's--

664
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:11,920
I feel like one spot when you're
becoming a web-- or a developer,

665
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,119
I guess, where everything else
becomes much easier. Like-- it's

666
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,650
like there's this thought
process, you have to, like,

667
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:19,584
change your brain to, like,
learn how to code almost. And

668
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,429
that's,

669
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:23,860
like, hard. And I think it's--
it doesn't really matter what

670
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:29,980
language you pick or what, you
know? If it's web or probably

671
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,079
the same for [laughs] not web
stuff-- I don't know. I can't

672
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,178
even think

673
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:35,799
of-- oh, C++. That was what I
learned, C++ in college for a

674
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:37,419
little bit

675
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:41,230
before I dropped out. But once
we learn how to become a

676
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,825
developer, you know, then--
maybe I'm making this up, but I

677
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:46,420
feel

678
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,130
like everything else becomes
ease- like, it becomes easier

679
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:52,119
to jump, like, from different
languages, you know? The--

680
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,940
if you're moving-- you know, if
you're moving from

681
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,454
JavaScript to Ruby, you know,
that-- there's going to be,

682
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:57,968
like,

683
00:35:57,969 --> 00:35:59,334
a bunch of differences. You'll
be confused for a second, for a

684
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:00,699
little bit. But,

685
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:03,070
like, it'll- it'll click a lot
faster, you know? You'll ask the

686
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,344
right questions, you like,
"Okay, I know how to do this."

687
00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:05,618
And, you

688
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:07,014
know, "I know how I would do
this. But that approach doesn't

689
00:36:07,014 --> 00:36:08,409
seem to

690
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:11,349
work," you know, "in Rails." "So
here's--" you know, "Okay, well,

691
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:13,300
I can Google for that. And
probably there'll be an answer,"

692
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:17,380
you know? Like, that kind of
thing. The- the hard part,

693
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,705
the beginning is just, like-- I
don't know. Re- I don't know--

694
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:22,030
resetting

695
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,119
all the, you know, the paths in
your brain, you know? I feel

696
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:25,449
like--

697
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,539
Colleen: Yeah. And I think, once
we've come through

698
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:31,019
it, it's hard to remember how
hard it was. Like, now,

699
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,599
it's, like- like you said, Dan.
Like, taking on a new language,

700
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,610
yeah, it's kind of hard. And
it's, like, I gotta learn all

701
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,670
this new stuff. But you mostly
get it, right? Like, you can

702
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,489
mostly make it work. But, like,
I think it's- it's hard to

703
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:43,454
remember, like-- it's really
hard when you start. Like, with

704
00:36:43,454 --> 00:36:45,419
no

705
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,250
context, like, it's really hard.

706
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:54,719
Dan: Yeah. No, I totally get it.
It was-- sorry [laughs], I

707
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:57,389
was just gonna say that that was
something that, actually,

708
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,989
Virtual Coffee helped me
remember or realize, you know?

709
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:03,659
Because it had been a long time
since I was there. But I do. I

710
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:07,050
mean, I- I remember struggling
and having no idea, you know,

711
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:10,710
what I was doing. But it is.
It's hard. Like, the kind of

712
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,989
questions you ask are much
different when you're

713
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:17,820
starting out, versus one year
whatever-- a year or two under,

714
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:23,610
you know, under your- under your
belt. And hanging out with a lot

715
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,800
of people who are learning for
the first time is- is

716
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,110
instructive, you know, and cool
to see.

717
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:31,949
Bekah: Yeah, I don't know if
this- if this

718
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:36,960
tracks—because I'm not really a
musician—but we see a lot of

719
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,489
musicians moving into tech. But
I know- I know, my brother plays

720
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:43,920
a lot of instruments, right? And
learning to play an instrument

721
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,480
can be really hard. But if you
get a good understanding of how

722
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,480
to play that instrument and a
good concept of music, then it's

723
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,449
easier to pick up the next
instrument and to learn that one

724
00:37:54,449 --> 00:37:58,260
too, right? Because there's this
idea of, like, how you approach

725
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,079
it and the pattern matching that
happens, too. And there is

726
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,440
going to be some overlap with
these different things. And in

727
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,230
your brain is kind of like,
"Okay. I see that there's a

728
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,780
pattern here. It's not exactly
the same, but I can get there a

729
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,769
little bit quicker."

730
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:19,739
Dan: I think that's a great
metaphor-- or is it an analogy?

731
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:27,090
What is difference? Doesn't
matter? Oh, well, all right. Are

732
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,070
we in a metaphor right now? Or
are we in an analogy?

733
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:30,838
Bekah: I think we're in an
analogy.

734
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,749
Dan: Okay. Cool. [Laughs] So
that's a great analogy, Bekah.

735
00:38:33,749 --> 00:38:36,538
And I

736
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:39,840
think that kind of ties back--
or in my head, it's- it's time--

737
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,760
what I was- what I was saying
was- was the thing that you're

738
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,219
teaching yourself is music.
Your- your asset, like, you have

739
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:47,699
to be teaching yourself piano or
x at the same time, but really,

740
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:51,030
you're teaching your brain how
to music, you know? And so,

741
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,940
moving from instrument to
instrument, you don't have to

742
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,650
relearn how music works, you
know? You have to learn-- you

743
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,460
know, you have to learn some new
intricacies or whatever. Like,

744
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,769
I- I played a lot of
instruments, but I never really

745
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:07,109
played any string instruments
because they're different

746
00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:09,449
[laughs]. Like,

747
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:11,280
you have to use two hands to be
used in different ways, you

748
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,809
know? And, I mean, I'm
sure—probably could have—but,

749
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:19,710
you know, I played, like, every
single brass instrument and

750
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:21,179
could just pick them up
because-- I don't know, it's

751
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:22,619
like- it's

752
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,404
like all and when you're in
JavaScript or something, you

753
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,189
know? Like,

754
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:30,150
React, Vue, and all these things
are much more similar. But even

755
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:34,409
if I jumped to violin, I-- my
brain still knows music, you

756
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:36,074
know? You know, so-- I don't
know. I like-- I'd very much

757
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,739
like that

758
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:42,239
analogy, Bekah. We're collecting
a series of, like, really good

759
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,210
develop-- like, programming
developer journey

760
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:49,559
analogies. So because Marie had
the really good one about- about

761
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,440
cooking, you know, about being a
chef, and recipes, and stuff

762
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,510
like that. So I like it.

763
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:03,300
Bekah: Okay. So, you're doing
consulting. And so,

764
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,230
you're primarily a Rails
developer, right? But then,

765
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:11,219
you've decided to tackle React,
and you're building this

766
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:13,184
product, right? And so, you're,
like, trying to balance all

767
00:40:13,184 --> 00:40:15,149
these

768
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,530
complicated things.

769
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,084
Colleen: [Laughs] It's too much.
So, yes. So, first

770
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:24,788
things first. I am

771
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:28,510
committing to taking-- okay. I
didn't take this Sunday off. But

772
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,619
I am committing to taking
Sundays off. And I started doing

773
00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:35,109
that a couple months ago. And
that has been really good for

774
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:37,599
myself.

775
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:41,710
So, basically, I'm trying to-
I'm trying to commit to

776
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:45,280
balancing these things in a way
where I can take the weekends

777
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:48,010
off. And it's funny. So, I've
started, like-- this is so sad I

778
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,460
have to do this, guys. But on
Friday, I delete Twitter. Like,

779
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,829
I just delete it from my phone.
It's, like, because I can't have

780
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:57,130
it on my phone. I just can't.
Like, it's terrible. But then--

781
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:59,440
and so, I don't have Slack on my
phone, I don't have Twitter on

782
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,760
my phone, which is really good.
So I think that's been really

783
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,949
good at helping me balance. It's
just like, finding the time,

784
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:08,138
like,

785
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:12,010
trying to really take a step
away on the weekends. But then,

786
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,809
I come back on Monday and
everyone's been hanging out all

787
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:16,314
weekend. And I'm like, "Oh, I
miss all these things." [Laughs]

788
00:41:16,314 --> 00:41:18,819
So there's that. But for

789
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,175
me, like, balancing these
things-- so, the consulting, I

790
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:23,530
have one

791
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,630
kind of long-term client, which
isn't too bad. It's like

792
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,090
maintenance. And that right now,
I have a pretty intense project,

793
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:30,670
which is taking up all my time.
But it's nice, because I can do

794
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,460
it in short bursts. So I can
work really hard for three

795
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,539
months, have enough money for
six months. And then, for the

796
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:41,889
next three months, focus on my
product. Or at least that is my

797
00:41:41,889 --> 00:41:46,059
master plan. I started to learn
React, and

798
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:50,829
then I just stopped because,
like, I ain't got time for that.

799
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:50,349
So maybe in the future [laughs]
I'll sort that out. But--

800
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:54,639
yeah. The

801
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:57,009
reason I started to try to learn
React is because I'm building

802
00:41:57,009 --> 00:42:01,329
this product, and I was getting
a lot of requests for a React

803
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:00,475
component. And then, one of,
like, my internet friends built

804
00:42:00,475 --> 00:42:03,940
a

805
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:06,940
React component because he
wanted it—which is awesome. But

806
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,819
I tell you what. I sure don't
know how to maintain it. And now

807
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:09,698
I'm [laughs]

808
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,930
trying to make changes. And I'm,
like, [gasps]. So, yeah. That's

809
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:14,920
a bridge

810
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:13,719
I'm going to cross in the
future. Like, that- that was

811
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:17,739
just too

812
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:18,339
much. Like, trying to learn
that, and try to do the product,

813
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:21,729
and

814
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:25,239
trying to work, and do the
podcast, and all the things was

815
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:27,909
too much. So I'm tabling that
till I have some more time. I

816
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:31,869
mean, this is like a life, like,
as we talked about earlier,

817
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:34,630
like, this is our life. So if
we're constantly in sprint mode,

818
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:36,039
like, how are we going to
recover? And how are we going

819
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:40,209
to--

820
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:38,890
like, this is my life. Something
that occurred to me, like, when

821
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:43,150
I

822
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:47,199
was starting the product and it
was really intense. It sounds

823
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,509
like- like, "What is my goal
here?" Like, "Yes, I want to

824
00:42:46,509 --> 00:42:49,868
have a

825
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:54,610
product. But if I spent the next
10 years, like, heads down on

826
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:53,334
this product every weekend ..."
Like, the reason I want to have

827
00:42:53,334 --> 00:42:56,558
a

828
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:59,619
successful product is because I
want to buy a house. Like, it's

829
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:59,799
real simple. Like, I want a
house with a backyard, and I

830
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:03,039
want my

831
00:42:59,769 --> 00:43:03,354
kids to have their own bedrooms.
Like, that's [laughs], you know,

832
00:43:03,354 --> 00:43:06,939
that's-

833
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:09,489
that's why. And it occurred to
me, I was like, "If I spent 10

834
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:12,940
years, like, heads down on this
product and then sold it, even

835
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:15,250
if I sell it for $10 million, it
doesn't matter because my kids

836
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:18,730
will almost be out of the house
by that point. And I'll have

837
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:22,030
missed what they really want
more than a house, which is to

838
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:24,699
hang out with me." So I know
that's, like, kind of cliche to

839
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,179
say, but it's true. Like, it
just kind of hit me, like, even

840
00:43:25,179 --> 00:43:28,328
if I

841
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:31,210
make $10 million, and it takes
me 10 years, it does not matter

842
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:34,630
because there'll be teenagers,
and they won't wanna hang out

843
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:37,300
with me anymore. So, hence the--
I'm always taking weekends off.

844
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:40,599
I'm always gonna focus on my
priorities, and I'll fit in

845
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,599
everything else as I can fit it
in.

846
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,190
Dan: I think that's awesome. I--
it's so hard to do, too. I mean,

847
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:50,949
I'm-- it's really hard. I'm
jealous, like, of your-- I

848
00:43:50,949 --> 00:43:53,829
don't know. It seems like--
what's the right word? There

849
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:56,709
[??]-- it seems

850
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,840
like you're doing it, you know?
Like, you're doing the weekends

851
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,050
off, and, you know, everything.
And-- I don't know. Jealous is a

852
798
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,690
silly word. Because I know that
I could just say, "Oh, I'll just

853
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,717
take weekends off too," you
know? [Laughs] Right? Yeah, it's

854
00:44:05,717 --> 00:44:06,744
hard.

855
00:44:06,745 --> 00:44:08,800
It's hard

856
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,140
to- it's hard to, like, let go.
I also started with the-- like

857
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,480
the--

858
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:15,519
like you said, coming back on
Mondays and ... I don't know.

859
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,499
Everything--

860
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:22,210
everybody was hanging out, doing
cool stuff. Also, like, it's

861
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:25,960
like, I got a bunch of stuff I
want to do, you know? And it's

862
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,589
hard to tell myself not to
[laughs], you know? That's

863
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:34,179
really awesome to hear you talk
about that.

864
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,670
Bekah: Yeah, it's my husband was
talking to me

865
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:40,960
this morning. And he was like,
"You can't just ..." I can't-- I

866
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,579
don't know how I put it, but,
"You can't just sprint all the

867
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:44,124
time," right? Like, "You need a
rest. Everybody needs to rest."

868
00:44:44,124 --> 00:44:45,669
And I was like,

869
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:48,564
"But no, I don't [laughs], you
know? I can just keep going. I

870
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:50,679
can power through it,"

871
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:53,409
right? Eventually you get a
second win. But how many times

872
00:44:53,409 --> 00:44:57,309
you get a second win? I mean,
you don't want one-- you don't

873
00:44:57,309 --> 00:44:58,030
have one-- second one.

874
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:02,979
Colleen: [Laughs] And then, you
collapse from exhaustion. That's

875
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:03,699
how that goes.

876
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:07,359
Bekah: Yeah. It is like
balancing what-- the kids

877
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,909
too, you know?

878
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:12,819
It's-- there's just so much to
try and figure out, and you want

879
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:15,729
to

880
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:18,280
stay up on things, you want to
learn things, and you want to do

881
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,429
work, and you want to grow. And
then, you want to hang out with

882
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:28,329
your kids. And it is just
really, really challenging to be

883
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:31,360
able to do that. And like you're
saying. You miss out on what

884
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:34,630
people are doing or somebody
like, "I learned 17 languages

885
00:45:34,659 --> 00:45:36,250
during the pandemic. What did
you learn?" Like [laughs]--

886
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:41,530
Colleen: Yeah. When I started
doing React, I bought a

887
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,929
book and I know the author
really well. So that's cool. So

888
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:47,769
I literally have the author on,
like, speed dial. And one of my

889
00:45:47,769 --> 00:45:49,960
friends was like, "Oh, I bought
this book and I read it in a

890
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,029
weekend." And I was like, "Ugh,
I don't want to read a React

891
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:54,098
book all

892
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:55,794
weekend." Like, I just don't.
But people are doing that so you

893
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,489
feel like you're getting ahead.

894
00:45:57,579 --> 00:46:00,939
Bekah: I juggling that. I can
juggling at the

895
00:46:00,939 --> 00:46:04,299
book. Yeah. Maybe that's how

896
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:10,448
I'll start putting myself to
sleep. [Laughs] Sorry. I just--

897
00:46:10,449 --> 00:46:13,210
coding books are not my--
they're not my thing.

898
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,159
Dan: I stopped buying them a
while ago. I have like-- oh,

899
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:16,975
yeah. You can see some of them
behind me. But I have, like, a

900
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:18,400
pile of

901
00:46:18,429 --> 00:46:23,590
books and I- I can never get
through them, you know? It's

902
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,800
like my free time, if I'm
actually having free time. I

903
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,380
don't want to be doing anything
related to my computer anymore,

904
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:33,369
or development, or, you know.
It's, like, there are all this

905
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:38,110
stuff, books, and podcasts, and
everything that I want to

906
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,659
consume because I want to know
them and, you know, know the

907
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,170
material and all that stuff. But
it's just so hard. It's--

908
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:46,719
there's not enough hours,
really, in the day, you know?

909
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:48,729
Colleen: Yeah, well, I think
we're socialized to one of

910
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,619
work all the time. So we should
figure out a way to socialize

911
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:54,300
like- like gold star, every
Sunday you don't work. And then,

912
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,469
you can, like, move it to Sunday
and Saturday. Double gold

913
00:46:56,469 --> 00:46:58,524
stars [laughs]. Like, we need to
find a way to incentivize

914
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,579
ourselves

915
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,489
not to work all the time.
Because there's so much pressure

916
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:04,269
to work all the time.

917
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:09,340
Dan: That's-- I like that idea--
that gold stars in your--

918
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:11,574
yeah. The- the-- like,
incentives are your health, but

919
00:47:11,574 --> 00:47:13,779
it, like--

920
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,539
it's like a long term thing,
right? So you're never gonna

921
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:18,714
know until-- the incentives will
not show up until- until

922
00:47:18,714 --> 00:47:20,889
much later [laughs]. Yeah.

923
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,280
Colleen: Yeah, you're totally
right. Like, it's-- you

924
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,260
really won't know until it's too
late, right? Because then you'll

925
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,900
just get a pass out from
exhaustion or whatever. However,

926
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,880
everyone deals with a different
way, right? But I'm sure we've

927
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,929
all done that where we work way
too much. And then, you know, we

928
00:47:33,929 --> 00:47:35,610
have to deal with the
ramifications of that.

929
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:39,809
Dan: Yes [laughs]. Yes, that
sounds familiar, vaguely.

930
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,750
Bekah: I want to jump back just
for a second. So,

931
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,079
you know, we talked about, like,
the benefits of working for

932
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:52,139
yourself and community support.
But also-- so, I'm, like,

933
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:55,199
interested

934
00:47:55,199 --> 00:48:02,280
in this question of what
qualities are important in the

935
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,070
people that you work with? So,
you know, it might be your

936
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:07,710
clients or if you can reimagine
yourself going back into the

937
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,704
workforce, like-- what- what are
those things that make you

938
00:48:09,704 --> 00:48:11,698
want

939
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:14,820
to work with that person? Or
make it a safe space, a safe

940
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,690
environment for you?

941
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:18,150
Colleen: Yeah, sure. I've worked
with a lot of people

942
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,760
doing that because I do like a
combination of contracting and

943
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,670
consulting. So I'll drum, jump
on, and augment a team for six

944
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:28,590
months to a year, or I'll work,
you know, in a smaller group. So

945
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:36,179
what I look for in people I work
with, I really like people

946
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:41,880
who are honest, obviously, who
are-- I don't want to say--

947
00:48:41,909 --> 00:48:44,880
well, like, empathetic and
understanding, like my very

948
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,690
first contract job. And it was,
like, really exciting to get

949
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:53,429
this because I was, like, really
new. It was a team. They were VC

950
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:56,039
backed. So they had a lot of
money. It was a team of, like,

951
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:58,649
a bunch of, like, 22-year-old
guys [laughs]. I mean, guys,

952
00:48:58,649 --> 00:49:01,259
this was, like, me

953
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:06,119
coming off of being a stay at
home mom. I'm what? Like, 32.

954
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:08,309
And they're, like, on Slack. And
they would type things like-

955
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:10,499
like--

956
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,460
they would just type all these
acronyms I didn't even know. It

957
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,039
was hilarious. But, okay. So
these guys-- and these guys did

958
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:19,530
work all the time, which was
negative. So things I look for--

959
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:23,400
my point of bringing these--
bringing this up is despite the

960
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,230
fact that, like, they were kind
of young, and they were really

961
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:29,039
excited, and they had money,
they were also, like, really

962
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,190
okay and kind of empathetic to
the fact that, like, my life

963
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:36,179
situation was really different
than theirs. And so, when I

964
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:37,754
couldn't turn around a feature
superfast or, like, when I

965
00:49:37,754 --> 00:49:39,329
wasn't

966
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:42,960
online on the weekends, like,
they got it. And so, that's

967
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,220
really important. Like- like,
the people you work with don't

968
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,480
have

969
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,110
to be in the same life stage
you're in. But if they can at

970
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:52,860
least understand and not
penalize you for having to stop

971
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,110
work because you got to go pick
the kids up from daycare or

972
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:56,849
whatever it is, that's really
important.

973
00:49:57,809 --> 00:50:00,149
I just like people who are
honest and, you know, really

974
00:50:00,149 --> 00:50:02,489
open

975
00:50:02,489 --> 00:50:05,429
to learning. I think no matter
where you are in your coding

976
00:50:05,429 --> 00:50:09,809
journey, you can-- there can be
a lot of give and take. I worked

977
00:50:09,809 --> 00:50:13,380
with someone else who was, like,
really militant—I don't know if

978
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,245
that's the right word about a
specific style of coding. And

979
00:50:16,245 --> 00:50:19,110
I--

980
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:21,300
if I were to work with that
person again, I would push back

981
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,309
a little more on that-- even the
way, you know, when people

982
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:26,730
review PRs, like, there's so
much you can tell. By the way,

983
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:30,179
people review your PRs. But--
yeah. I mean, just people who

984
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:32,969
treat you equally and fairly
like part of the team, and there

985
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:36,630
doesn't have to be a team
hierarchy, and our-- you know,

986
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,119
give and take, like, you can
teach them something and they

987
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,079
can teach you something.

988
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,670
Bekah: Yeah, that's so great. I
think, in one

989
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:48,030
of my previous jobs, I was there
for many, many years. And I

990
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:51,210
don't know that anyone ever told
me good job. And I don't think

991
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:54,570
I ever realized it until Dan and
I started working together. And

992
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:58,110
he said, "Good job." And I was
like, "Oh." Like, that was nice,

993
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:01,650
right? Like [laughs]-- I don't
know. Just

994
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:03,569
feels good to-- I don't know.
It's an- it's an

995
00:51:03,569 --> 00:51:08,309
acknowledgement, and it's
simple, right? And--

996
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,650
Dan: Yeah, I think- I think one
of the things I tried to

997
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:15,590
look out for is yet the sort of
a two way communication, you

998
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:19,940
know? Like, that's something I
value personally. It kind of

999
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:22,235
ties into everything you were
saying. But, you know, being

1000
00:51:22,235 --> 00:51:23,780
more

1001
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,989
of an equal footing, even if
it-- even, like-- yes, there's a

1002
00:51:26,989 --> 00:51:29,344
client, you know, relationship,
you know? I sensibly-- I'm doing

1003
00:51:29,344 --> 00:51:31,699
work for a

1004
00:51:31,699 --> 00:51:35,569
person, you know? Like-- I don't
know. The client's always

1005
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:37,099
right or whatever, you know? But
it's, like--

1006
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:39,829
Colleen: Well, I have hired--
yeah. I have hired a

1007
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:43,159
contractor who's a better
developer than I am. I hired him

1008
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:47,659
to review my PRs. And, like, I
loved his style because he

1009
00:51:47,659 --> 00:51:51,110
would pull out something, he'd
be like, "Hey, this is really

1010
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,269
cool. How you did this?" Or, "I
really liked the way this is

1011
00:51:53,269 --> 00:51:54,874
structured." And then, he would
bring in, "But did you know

1012
00:51:54,874 --> 00:51:56,479
about

1013
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,360
this resource? Have you read
this article?" Like-- and it

1014
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,610
was just so cool, like, yay!

1015
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:06,619
Dan: I mean, that is awesome.
But also, just the idea

1016
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:08,929
that-- I don't know, being
comfortable with hiring somebody

1017
00:52:08,929 --> 00:52:11,239
that you know

1018
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:13,849
is very much better than you or
whatever-- like, that situation,

1019
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:16,579
like, the fact that you did that
is, like, just such a cool thing

1020
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:19,760
to me. Just as a business owner,
and as, like, a developer, and

1021
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,989
somebody who, you know, wants to
keep learning. But maybe this

1022
00:52:23,989 --> 00:52:27,679
is-- maybe it's only strange to
me? I don't know.

1023
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,434
That's strange, but, like,
surprising, or-- that's not

1024
00:52:29,434 --> 00:52:31,158
even

1025
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:35,300
the right word. But the-- that,
like, you did it on purpose,

1026
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,574
right? Like, that tactical
thing. You're like, "I want to

1027
00:52:36,574 --> 00:52:37,848
go hire

1028
00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:39,439
somebody to-- that is, like,
much better than me to help me

1029
00:52:39,439 --> 00:52:41,029
and my

1030
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,250
business." And that's also-- I
just think that's so cool.

1031
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,530
Colleen: Yeah. Honestly, it went
so well. Now

1032
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,019
I'm looking for, like,
opportunities to do it, again.

1033
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,564
I'm like, "How can I hire him
again?" [Laughs] Like, "How do

1034
00:52:49,564 --> 00:52:51,049
we do this again?"

1035
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:52,460
Dan: That's really cool.

1036
00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:57,170
Bekah: Yeah, that is super
awesome. Okay, Colleen,

1037
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:00,650
it's been really great having
you here. And so, we really

1038
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:04,849
appreciate you talking about
these things. And where can our

1039
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:05,960
listeners find you?

1040
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,019
Colleen: I am on Twitter. My
handle is

1041
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:12,559
@leenyburger. You can also check
out my podcast, the Software

1044
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:21,649
Bekah: Like and hit subscribe. I
think, actually,

1045
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:26,630
the first time I ever met you,
we were doing, like, co-working

1046
00:53:26,659 --> 00:53:31,400
in the Moms Can Code and your
handle was leenyburger. And I'm

1047
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,960
pretty sure I called you Leeny.
So [laughs]--

1048
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:36,394
Colleen: [Laughs] It's a
terrible handle. Like, I had

1049
00:53:36,394 --> 00:53:37,698
no idea that,

1050
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,000
like, Twitter was a real thing
when I signed up. And now, it's,

1051
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,130
like, I'm stuck with it for
life. So-- oh, well [laughs].

1052
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:45,650
Bekah: You can't get away from
it [laughs].

1053
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,069
Dan: I think it's great handle,
by the way. I think it's

1054
00:53:49,069 --> 00:53:49,698
awesome.

1055
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:51,559
Colleen: Thanks [laughs].

1056
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:52,849
Bekah: I'm sorry I called you
Leeny [laughs].

1057
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,909
Colleen: I don't even remember.
I do remember you were,

1058
00:53:55,909 --> 00:53:58,550
like, on the treadmill or
something while we were- we were

1059
00:53:58,550 --> 00:53:59,210
co-working.

1060
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:00,800
Bekah: Exercise bike. Yeah.

1061
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,019
Colleen: I was pretty impressed.
I was like, "Oh, nice."

1062
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:06,089
Bekah: [Laughs] Trying to-
trying to get it all in.

1063
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,219
Colleen, it's been great having
you here. And we're really

1064
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:15,960
excited to see what comes next
and to listen to your podcast

1065
