00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,710
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to season 1, episode

2
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,859
7 of the Virtual Coffee
podcast. I'm Bekah, and this is

3
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,010
a podcast that features members
of the Virtual Coffee community.

4
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,519
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,460
stages of their coding journey.
And they're here on this podcast

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,670
sharing their stories and what
they've learned. And we're here

7
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,750
to share it with you. Here with
me today is my co-host, Dan.

8
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:43,469
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. In this
episode, we talked to Colleen

9
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,100
Schnettler. Colleen is a Ruby on
Rails consultant who recently

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,670
launched her first product
called Simple File Upload. She's

11
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,719
also a career changer and a mom.
We discussed the challenges of

12
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,600
being a woman in the workplace,
the benefits of working for

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,170
yourself, and how difficult it
can be to learn to code in the

14
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,709
first place. It can take time
and commitment, but when you get

15
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,060
there, it will all be worth it.

16
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:08,819
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We start
every episode of the podcast

17
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,640
like we start every Virtual
Coffee. We introduce ourselves

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,569
with our name, where we're from,
what we do, and a random check-in

19
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:20,280
question. Today's question
is what movie can you watch

20
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,859
over and over without ever
getting tired of? We hope you

21
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:40,890
enjoy this episode.
Hey, I'm Bekah, I'm a front end

22
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:45,659
developer from a small town in
Ohio. And if I could watch any

23
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:50,400
movie over and over, it would
depend on my mood and the genre.

24
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:52,109
But The Sandlot and The Princess
Bride are solid choices.

25
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:54,120
Dan Ott: Oh, yeah. Princess
Bride, it's really good.

26
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,930
Um, I'm not... Sandlot, I've never been
a huge fan of. Which is like, I know, I

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,500
know it's, I know. But it's just like
there's a mean dog. And I don't

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,549
know, it's just too much for me.

29
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,039
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: The dog's not
really mean. Spoiler alert. (laugh)

30
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,120
Dan Ott: All right, well, (laugh)
maybe I should watch it again.

31
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:16,639
Hi, I'm Dan, I do front end
development from Cleveland,

32
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:22,550
Ohio. My movie that I watch, can
pretty much watch anytime is The

33
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:27,710
Matrix, I guess. And also, Thor
Ragnarok more recently. But

34
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,939
I've, that movie came out, what,
four years ago? I don't know

35
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:33,860
when it came out exactly. But I
think I've watched it like 20

36
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,740
times, so... (laugh) That's, I mean, it's
a good, I don't know, like watched every

37
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,120
second of it. But I like it.

38
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:45,590
Colleen Schnettler: I'm Colleen.
I'm a Rails developer. I am

39
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,289
right now on the East Coast, but
about to move to the West Coast.

40
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:55,039
And a movie I could watch over
and over would be Moana. I mean,

41
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,520
it's just like the perfect
movie. The music is amazing. The

42
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,449
story is amazing. It's funny. I
know I'm giving myself a way as

43
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,780
like having to have watched it a
million times. But I never get

44
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,229
sick of it.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,319
Dan Ott: It is the perfect
movie. My kids have gotten sick

46
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,889
of it. Because I'm, and yeah, we
could have a whole podcast about

47
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:18,180
movies that I've unwillingly watched
a million times (laugh). That's

48
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,080
a whole separate, separate
question. But Moana is awesome.

49
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,460
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I feel like
I need to go back and watch

50
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,110
Moana again, coz I think I fell
asleep or got bored.

51
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:30,360
Dan Ott: It's just so good. And
you know, happy and, I don't

52
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,800
know. It's good. I like it.

53
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,250
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I like the
soundtrack. "I am Mo..." Okay. We can cut

54
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:42,659
that. I don't mean, I'm not gonna sing.
(laugh) Anyway, thanks for being here,

55
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:48,000
Colleen. We are super happy to
have you on the podcast. And,

56
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,599
um, when we start off the
podcast, we just always like to

57
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,650
get the origin story of our
guests. So you have quite an

58
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,560
origin story. You're a career
changer as well. But let's just

59
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,699
kind of start there. How'd you
get into software engineering?

60
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,250
Colleen Schnettler: Sure. So my
background is actually in

61
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,990
electrical engineering. So very
hard work, hardware focused. And

62
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,829
the first half of my career I
worked at the shipyard, at a

63
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,370
shipyard in Newport News, where
we were working on some of the

64
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,040
electronic systems surrounding
naval aircraft carriers. And I

65
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,870
ended up leaving that job to
stay home with my children. And

66
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,670
then I stayed home with the kids
for three or four years. And it

67
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,639
was around that time when I was
staying home when I was getting

68
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,290
ready to go back to work, that I
really, really wanted flexible

69
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:49,560
and remote work. And it's so
hard to find that. Even with an

70
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,689
engineering background. My
previous work had been so hands

71
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:57,959
on that there was no
opportunity, especially in

72
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,290
defense contracting, there was
no opportunity for me to do

73
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,670
that work remotely. And so I
started looking for other

74
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:10,379
opportunities. And I started
trying to teach myself to learn

75
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:14,870
to code.
I released an iOS app, which I

76
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:18,740
don't know that I've mentioned
before, maybe I have. Anyway, in

77
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:22,579
like, 2012, and it was a
disaster and like, the thing

78
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:27,139
hardly worked. I mean, you have
to pay Apple $100 a month to be

79
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:33,649
in their developer program. So, yeah, right?
(laugh) So, it was, um, it didn't work

80
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:36,560
out the way I had hoped. I did
everything wrong. Like, I did

81
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:41,779
everything wrong with this iOS
app. But what I realized what

82
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:46,910
was, there was a way I could
stay in my house and work and

83
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:50,569
get paid. And so the process
took many, many, many years to

84
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:54,920
get where I am today, but I just
kind of started chipping away at

85
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:57,709
learning web development,
because I saw that as an

86
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,129
opportunity for flexible remote
work.

87
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:04,240
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, that
is awesome. I think the

88
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:09,160
first CodeNewbie podcast I ever
listened to was your episode.

89
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,639
And it was so great, because I
was like, okay, like, look,

90
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,860
look, she did this. And I don't
know, it gave me a lot of

91
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:18,970
confidence to keep moving
forward with my journey. So very

92
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,269
much appreciate you sharing your
story and being willing to talk

93
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:26,860
through that journey.

94
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,459
Colleen Schnettler: That's
awesome. I'm glad you got

95
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:29,209
something out of it.

96
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,769
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I also like
to ask everybody, their history

97
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:39,149
with Virtual Coffee. So how did
you come to Virtual Coffee?

98
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,589
Colleen Schnettler: So I have
forever been looking for a

99
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:49,170
community, with, with people on
the internet, right? Like, I'm,

100
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,980
I'm not great in big groups. I
love people. And I love

101
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,709
interacting with people. But
like, if you put me in a Zoom

102
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:59,129
room with like, 10 people or
more, I'm out. Like, I'm mentally

103
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:01,319
checked out. Like, I just can't
really wrap my brain around

104
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,540
that. And so I've actually
joined several groups. Internet,

105
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,120
internet groups, I don't know what you
call this (laugh). Community is a better

106
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,290
word. I've joined several
communities. But the ones I've

107
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,889
joined, I've had two really
distinct problems. The first

108
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:20,699
problem is that it's just so
hard to foster authentic

109
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,819
connection on the internet with
large groups of people. It just

110
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,879
is like, if you don't get to
know someone, it's just I really

111
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,810
struggle with that. And the
second thing is I have joined

112
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,470
some paid communities. And
they're paid for like, because

113
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm trying to, I'm starting a
business. So I've joined some of

114
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,709
those communities. And those are
more like highlight reels of

115
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,139
everyone's success. So it's
almost like people are just

116
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,470
like, dropping in to tell you
how awesome they are and to

117
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,050
promote their product. And, and
of course, we're all trying to

118
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,110
protect ourselves, right? I get
it. But it doesn't, that doesn't

119
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,329
do anything for me. I'm sure
you're doing great. That's

120
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:57,480
wonderful. But it's hard for me
to find, really until I found

121
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,000
you guys. You know, it was just,
I didn't find a community where

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,230
people were honest. And I think
we have pandemic. We're all at

123
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,730
home. We got our kids running
around like, we need a space to

124
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,930
be honest.

125
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:17,850
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, for
sure. And I feel like I also

126
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,699
recruited you. I was like, oh,
you're super cool.

127
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,310
Colleen Schnettler: Oh yeah. That's too.
You actually did. Like, I hate that I'm so

128
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,220
high maintenance that you had to
recruit me. Like, like, I saw

129
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,709
you on Twitter talking about it.
And I was like, I should do

130
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,620
that. But like, I was just so
overwhelmed by the current

131
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,250
demands on my time. Like, it was
just like, I cannot, I can't do

132
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,440
another, I was like, I can't do
another Slack group. I can't do

133
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,110
another fake community. No
offense. I didn't know at the

134
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,500
time, it was like, I can't do
another group of people that

135
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,220
don't really like, like,
connect. And you did. You sent me

136
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,730
a message and asked me
specifically. So again, I'm

137
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,320
sorry, I'm such a pain that you had
to told me in. But after you did,

138
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,600
it's been really great. And I
really appreciate you reaching

139
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:59,309
out and inviting me.

140
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:02,038
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, no,
I'm very glad you're here,

141
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:06,328
obviously, because I reached out
and made sure that you came

142
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:12,479
because I wanted you here too.
So yeah, I'm glad that I did

143
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:12,839
that.

144
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,649
Dan Ott: That's, that's really
interesting. The point you were

145
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:19,860
making about there was the
private community where, you

146
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,370
know, the highlight real thing,
you know, as you termed it,

147
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,590
right? The, everybody's always, I don't
know, they, motivation for sharing your

148
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:38,220
successes is I suppose fairly
clear, you know? But the, you

149
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,419
know, I found, I found similar,
I've found, I've had similar

150
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,879
issues with community, online
communities where I've just

151
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:51,299
never really connected, you know,
as well. And the highlight real

152
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,179
thing is aspect that I, I've
never liked, framed it that way.

153
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,389
Like the... you want to be able to
share your wins, you know, and

154
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:04,919
get high fives or whatever. But,
but the fact that like you'd,

155
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,169
like being very honest and
shared, being able to share, you

156
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:10,769
know, I don't know. I don't like
saying failures, you know, but

157
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:15,990
like, not wins, you know?
Hardships and struggles, you

158
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,620
know, things like that, I see it's
something that sort of happened

159
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,159
naturally here. But it is, I
mean, it is one of the like,

160
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:26,669
things that we, we very much
value and I think, really does,

161
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,429
you know, make Virtual Coffee
unique. (laugh)

162
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,549
Colleen Schnettler: Well, I
think the thing that's, that's

163
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:33,919
important to remember is it's
because of the leadership team.

164
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,450
Which is you guys. I mean,
Bekah'll drop in some like super

165
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,570
personal stuff. And I'm like,
whoa, like your midweek check-in,

166
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,000
it was like a couple months
ago, you like drop this, like,

167
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:47,629
super personal midweek check-in.
And I was like, oh, like, this

168
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:50,539
is a real midweek check-in like,
we're actually gonna be honest.

169
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,289
Okay, I can do that. But I'm
just not, I think guys, too, for

170
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:57,409
me, like, I've been a woman in
engineering for like, 20 years

171
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:01,879
now. Minus the four years I was
home. And so I am super, super,

172
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:04,250
because the way I've been
treated in the past, like, just

173
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:10,220
honestly, I'm super protective
of myself and my abilities. And

174
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,240
I think that mostly I, because
of that, I always try to present

175
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,019
myself a very specific way,
because I feel so judged all the

176
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:22,669
time. And that's just a
culmination of 10 years working

177
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:26,539
in an office and just having to
deal with that. And so I have

178
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:29,809
this really like, I don't know if
you say chip on my shoulder, I'd

179
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:33,139
rather say defense mechanism.
But I have this like, really

180
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:36,259
serious shield in front of me.
So I'm not going to go into a

181
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:39,860
group. And these groups I'm in
are all men, too, mostly. Like the

182
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,830
paid community I'm in (laugh), there's
like, maybe five other women.

183
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:48,080
And so, you know, I really
always have those shields up,

184
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,220
because I feel like I'm just
judged differently. Whether it's

185
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,289
true or not, I don't know. But
it's just my perception.

186
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,019
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: No, I feel
that so much. And I think it, for

187
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,299
me, this is (laugh) a very new
experience sharing very open

188
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,529
things about myself. Because I
spent a lot of years like with

189
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:10,470
the shield up and doing exactly
what you're saying. And then at

190
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,409
one point, I just, I couldn't
anymore because of what I had

191
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:16,529
gone through, like it was a
breaking point. And so I was

192
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:19,049
like, well, you know, I went
from sharing nothing to like,

193
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,679
here, here is everything, like,
I will just hand you my heart

194
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:26,370
and do what you want with it.
And I'm gonna keep moving on.

195
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,269
But, you know, you said
something too about, like,

196
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:33,210
communities can be really
exhausting online as well,

197
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,509
right? Like it's one more thing
to do, right? And I think that

198
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:41,490
you find the good community when
you are like, okay, this isn't.

199
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,539
These are, these are people who
support me as a person. And

200
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:50,580
they, they are interested in me
as a human being not as like a

201
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,919
possible consumer, or, you know,
as this, this one thing that

202
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,830
separates you from your
humanity. And it's really hard

203
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:04,860
to find, but really great when
you do find it. That kind of like

204
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:07,470
you touched on some of the
things I wanted to get started

205
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,470
with, too. It's like the, you're
doing a lot of things, right?

206
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,649
You are an independent
contractor, you're a podcaster,

207
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:21,149
you're building this, this tool.
You're a career changer, you're

208
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:25,710
a mom, like, first of all,
that's amazing. Second of all,

209
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,580
how do you stay motivated to do
all of these things?

210
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:35,610
Colleen Schnettler: Uh, I don't
know. Honestly, I don't know if

211
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,940
I'm doing the right thing. Like,
I wonder about it all the time.

212
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,450
A different community I'm in,
which is has been great as a

213
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,809
group of consultants. And we
talked about this a lot, because

214
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:49,200
there's a lot of consultants who
have moved to full time

215
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,330
employment, because I'm sure you
guys have had this experience as

216
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,759
well, like you contract for
someone, and then they offer you

217
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,929
a job. And every time, I'm like,
do I want to take it or not want

218
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:01,019
to take it like it just seems so
comfortable to have a regular

219
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:06,480
job, and then I'm like, oh, but
flexibility. And so I, you know,

220
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,009
I do question these decisions. I
think about a year ago, I really

221
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:15,330
got focused on trying to figure
out what I wanted, like long

222
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,110
term. What do I want? Not what
do I want next year, but like

223
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,429
what do I want for the rest of
my life as a career. And when I

224
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:28,440
go back to wanting that flexible
remote work, the real reason I

225
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,220
started coding, flexible, remote
work, obviously, but I've always

226
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,740
wanted my own business. Like
I've always wanted to be

227
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,570
completely independent. So the,
starting a product is really

228
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,809
hard because it's slow and you
don't know what you're doing and

229
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:46,379
like, it's just a whole thing
(laugh). So I have one...

230
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,529
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: So you have a
podcast on it.

231
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:49,639
Colleen Schnettler: Literally,
the reason we started the

232
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:55,970
podcast was so I would not quit. Like (laugh),
that's the only reason. But that's always been my

233
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,960
goal and I know why I want that.
And once I was able to really

234
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,460
define for myself what my
goal was, it made staying

235
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,899
motivated so much easier.
Because before my goal was kind

236
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:11,990
of nebulous, it was like, oh, I
just want to work flexibly and

237
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,860
remote. Okay. And then it was
like, oh, I just want to, you

238
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:21,110
know, make money. And something
Saron Yitbarek, the founder of

239
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:27,350
CodeNewbie, said to me once was
what are you optimizing for? And

240
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,690
that's my favorite question.
Because like, long term, this is

241
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,919
our life. So what are you
optimizing for? So I know that

242
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,379
my goal is to get a product off
the ground. I know the only way

243
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:40,129
to get a product off the ground
is to do all these things. I

244
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:42,320
mean, obviously it'll be great if
my product made enough money, I

245
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,350
didn't have to consult. But that's like
many years off. So (laugh), you know,

246
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:48,740
just trying to get through it.

247
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,470
Dan Ott: That, that idea of
optimizing, thinking about

248
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,090
things in that, in that
framework, is something that I

249
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,539
came across, I don't know, a
while ago. But it helped me the

250
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:07,100
same way. I've been independent
for a long time. And there have

251
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,960
been times, there have been times
where I've considered either

252
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,200
applying or taking jobs. And
it's the same thing. I'm not

253
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,700
optimized for making money. You
know, like, for instance, right?

254
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,730
That is not my main, I need to
make money, like, I need to

255
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,539
support my family, you know? Or
help, you know, help support my

256
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:27,769
family, and I need to pay bills,
and things like that. But, but

257
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:31,039
the, the main thing I'm
optimizing for, is that making

258
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,340
money, right? Otherwise, there's
other decisions, you know, I

259
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,539
could have made, right? And there
was, there came a time in my, I

260
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,600
think, in my mid-, late 20s, or
something where I had one of

261
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,269
those, what am I doing with my
life, you know? What am I doing

262
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,320
with my career moments? And I
think that, that question helped

263
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,519
me a lot to help me become
comfortable with staying

264
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,759
independent, you know, keeping
the flexibility. I like, the

265
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,700
flexibility and the, you know,
both in, in time and allow me to

266
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,619
follow my nose, sort of (laugh)? Sort
of a strange phrase, but like, you

267
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:13,700
know... Uh, I lost track of what
I was saying, the, what are you

268
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,980
optimizing for is a great
question to ask yourself

269
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,329
though, in pretty much any, any
decision you're trying to make.

270
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,130
I think it's a great way to
think about it.

271
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:24,910
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: So that's
where I'm going to be the rest

272
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,539
of the day trying to figure out what I'm
optimizing for (laugh). Like, what am

273
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:35,529
I doing? Can we even do the rest
of the podcast now? The other

274
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:38,769
thing, too, about being
independent is it allows you to

275
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:42,400
avoid some, so many workplace
challenges, right? Like, I don't

276
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,630
know, I don't really like
playing politics in the office.

277
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,380
That's been a challenge for me
in past jobs. And it's been nice

278
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,250
to not have to deal with that
kind of stuff. So have you found

279
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,440
that as a perk?

280
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,880
Colleen Schnettler: Oh, yeah, I
have so much to say about this.

281
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,509
Okay. I promise I won't (laugh),
I won't go too long.

282
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:05,509
But, so when I was young, so I'm
at a college, you know, I'm the

283
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:10,609
only woman working at this
company, I learned quickly that

284
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,849
at, at any big business, this was
a fortune 500 company, so a big

285
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:16,609
business. There are people who
get the good work, and people

286
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:19,849
who get the crappy work. And the
people who get the good work are

287
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,910
typically the people who are in
the in-crowd, right? There's all,

288
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,309
there's all this, like the
in-crowd of the smart people,

289
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,359
and then the hanger-oners. So I
quickly learned, like, the way

290
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,460
to get into the in-crowd is to
be liked. And this ended up

291
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,720
serving me poorly for like the
next 10 years. Because somehow

292
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,160
throughout my career, I learned,
okay, so my goal is to get in

293
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,190
the in-crowd, so I get the good
work. But there was a lot of

294
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,970
other weirdness that came with
that being the only woman on my

295
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,920
team. Just a lot of weird, you
know, uncomfortable things that

296
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,109
came with that. Trying to always
be nice. And trying to laugh at

297
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:02,359
like the microaggression. I
didn't even know those were

298
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:05,029
microaggressions. I don't think
we had a word for it 15 years

299
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:08,599
ago. But like, just so much
of that. And what I didn't

300
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:11,089
realize while I was going
through this, like playing work

301
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:14,180
politics, trying to be like,
laughing at the jokes that, you

302
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,180
know, about some woman who got
promoted, cuz she was a woman.

303
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:20,509
Like, what I didn't realize is
that was slowly chipping away at

304
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:25,549
like my self-worth. And I
didn't, I didn't even realize

305
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:28,430
that until, until now. Like,
looking back like 15 years

306
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,869
later, right? And so I really
think I hate office politics (laugh).

307
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,319
I mean like, so I'm out. Like, I'm
not doing that anymore. If I went

308
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,470
back to a job, like, I would
never put up with that now,

309
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,529
right? Like, I would never laugh
at those jokes. I would never,

310
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:49,160
like, take, not respond to some of
the ways I was treated. Now, you

311
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,930
know, in my late 30s, but in
my 20s I just didn't know. So

312
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:59,059
this combination of like office
politics and gender politics is

313
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:01,910
like oh, it was awful. And I
hope it's better. But I think

314
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,890
it probably depends on where you
work, you know, in terms of how

315
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,059
that how that goes.

316
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:14,150
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Oh, for sure
(laugh). Got so much to say about

317
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,029
that too. But that is, you know,
that's super frustrating, and too,

318
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,450
you're younger coming into this
industry as well. And I know

319
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,289
like, that was also an issue.
Being a young woman in an

320
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,799
industry, it can be really
challenging. I don't know how

321
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,430
many times I got comments that
were super inappropriate. You

322
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,900
wouldn't say to a man in that
same situation. But I always had

323
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,309
to deal with, you know, me being
young and me being a woman. And

324
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:44,630
that was just, for a long time
it was well, that's just the

325
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,829
way things are so you do kind
of laugh it off or whatever. But

326
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:52,549
now, yeah, there's, there's no
way that I stand for that now.

327
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,859
But also, I've been through
enough situations where I feel

328
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:03,559
like, you know what? I don't
care what happens if I respond

329
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:07,819
to this strongly because I'm done.
And it, and it doesn't matter.

330
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:12,349
But certainly 10 years ago, that's,
I was not nearly in this place.

331
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,380
Colleen Schnettler: Yeah.

332
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,670
Dan Ott: Yeah. That, the, the
question of, like, how to

333
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,569
respond with things like that,
what I was gonna say was the

334
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:28,369
advice, like, if you have advice
for somebody who is young, new

335
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:31,700
career and can't afford to maybe
burn bridges, not burn bridges,

336
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,059
but can't afford to just quit
their job, right? Because

337
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:38,509
they're supporting their family
or their, you know, the only one

338
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:40,309
making money, you know, with
their family and stuff like

339
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:45,440
that, like, what... How do you,
how would you try to give your

340
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,710
past selves advice, I guess,
maybe in this, in this situation?

341
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,920
Or how would you give somebody
who is coming out of college,

342
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,400
and joining the industry here,
or coming out of high school

343
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,549
even, you know, as a young
woman, like entering this? And

344
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:02,599
if they have these... If they end
up having experiences like this,

345
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,930
you know, because I'm sure that
plenty of women still are, I know

346
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,900
that plenty of women still are,
what would you tell, like, what

347
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,940
would be your advice to, to
somebody who's found themselves

348
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,970
in a situation like that, as a
young, as a young developer? If

349
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,359
anything (laugh).

350
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,630
Colleen Schnettler: I don't
really know, honestly. Which is

351
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,730
terrible. Like, you know, I just
feel like, my thoughts are, if I

352
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,180
could go back and talk to myself,
right? It's like, you think

353
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,359
it's okay, like you think these
are small, but like these, these

354
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:35,630
microaggressions, like they
compound, and they will impact

355
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,680
you long term so much more than
you can realize now at 22/23

356
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,609
years old. So, you know, you're
not going to get fired for

357
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:46,730
standing up to that person. It
could end, I mean, it could not,

358
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:51,859
it might not end great for you.
I ended up in one job with a

359
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:55,819
company I won't name. I
complained about my mentor,

360
00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:00,589
mentor who was treating me
poorly. And I got reassigned,

361
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:05,509
and he got promoted. Like, it was
terrible (laugh). So, you know, when I

362
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:09,829
finally stood up for myself,
that's what happened. And so

363
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:13,609
that obviously left a terrible
taste in my mouth. But I would,

364
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,250
I would also say that like you
think it's okay to let them go,

365
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,430
don't, don't let it go. Because
it's gonna compound and it's

366
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,549
gonna come back to bite you and
you're not gonna get fired.

367
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:24,440
Like, you might have something
like happen to me where you

368
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,369
might get reassigned. Look for a
new job, like, keep looking,

369
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:33,500
like, don't give up. And just,
just fight back because that BS

370
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,680
is exhausting. And it will just,
it will just eat it you over

371
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,039
time.

372
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,839
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, for
sure. I would, I totally agree

373
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:43,809
with that. And I think that, you
know, that look for a new job

374
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:46,690
thing is super important.
Because I know people that, well,

375
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,750
it wasn't that big of a deal, or
these other things about this

376
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,049
company are good, or it's hard
to find work. But like, the

377
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:56,049
minute that something like that
happens, and if you reported to

378
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:59,349
HR to a supervisor, and they
blow you off, then you know what

379
00:23:59,349 --> 00:24:02,650
kind of company you're working
for, right? It's not just one

380
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,740
thing. This is a company
culture. And so it is definitely

381
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,579
time to start looking for
something new. And I don't, I

382
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:15,670
think I have a couple of
thoughts too. But, um, one is

383
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:21,819
having somebody who is an ally
or a support person at your

384
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:27,309
company can be really useful.
So, you know, I was on this

385
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:32,170
committee and I, every time I
spoke, I was interrupted by one

386
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:37,569
of the older men in the meeting.
It was frequently happened. And

387
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:40,690
I didn't even realize that it
was happening. And then somebody

388
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,690
else pointed out to me that,
hey, he doesn't interrupt any

389
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,119
of the men when they speak. He
only interrupts you and the

390
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:52,720
other women. And having the, the
man who pointed this out to me,

391
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,950
say something. Then it was
recognized, right? And it's a

392
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,430
shame. It should not have to
happen that way. But definitely

393
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:05,380
having like allies who can stand
up for you and say, like, let's

394
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,910
not do this is really, really
important too.

395
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:13,900
Dan Ott: So you have been... I'm
sorry. Can you remind me how

396
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,119
long you've been, you've been
independent now for...

397
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:16,960
Colleen Schnettler: Four years.

398
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,250
Dan Ott: Four years now? Have
you run into any, like similar

399
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,779
issues since you've been
independent? Or...

400
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:28,390
Colleen Schnettler: Nope. So, one
thing I have to say... That is

401
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:33,069
awesome, yeah. I have had no
problems working for myself. I

402
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:36,490
think it's a combination of a
few things. I think, you know,

403
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,119
the world and the conversation
is changing around this issue.

404
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:44,079
I'm in the Rails community. And
I can't speak to the other

405
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,779
communities, but like the Ruby
and the Rails community is

406
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:51,910
spectacular. Just the most
inclusive, welcoming community.

407
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,690
I mean, I will never forget. I
went to my first Rails meetup

408
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,529
several years ago. And the guy
who was running the meetup is

409
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:04,269
like a super senior developer.
And I was coming off of my

410
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:07,299
previous experience, so that
story I told you about the guy

411
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,359
getting promoted and me getting
reassigned, that's when I quit

412
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:13,059
my job to stay home with my kids
(laugh). Cuz I was like, I'm done.

413
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:16,960
I can't do this anymore. So I'm
coming off of, you know, that

414
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,539
bad work experience, I was
coming off of being a stay at

415
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:22,509
home mom, I was really like,
just struggling. I didn't know

416
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:28,029
what I was doing. Self teaching
is hard. And I remember I met

417
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:30,609
him and he's like, super senior,
like, kind of well known in the

418
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:36,160
community. And like, he treated
me like an equal. And that

419
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,359
hadn't happened to me in so
long. And then people just kept

420
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,819
doing that to me. Like, they
just treated me like a human.

421
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:46,720
And it was this, it was, it was
like, it was amazing. Like, it

422
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,309
was just so amazing. And that
community is amazing. And I

423
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,670
think also being independent.
Like, I don't have to work on

424
00:26:54,670 --> 00:27:00,640
your team if I don't like you. So
(laugh) that's been really great too.

425
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:00,940
So yeah.

426
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,259
Dan Ott: Yeah, just another,
another bonus for being

427
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,099
independent, right?

428
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,599
Colleen Schnettler: Yeah, you
have so much freedom. You can

429
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,839
pick your clients, you can pick
your teams. I mean, I've worked

430
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:15,940
on some spectacular teams. And
it's because I have a lot of

431
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,940
choice. I can hire people or I
can work with my friends who are

432
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,769
hiring people, like it's a win-win.

433
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:25,460
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, so
you mentioned Saron earlier, and

434
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,259
I had a tweet from her pulled
up, because she said something...

435
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:33,619
She tweeted this recently on
February 1st, but she said, I was

436
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,900
reflecting on my experience. I
shouldn't even read this aloud

437
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,210
because she's got such a great
voice. And I hear it in my head,

438
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,000
and I'm gonna read it. Anyway (laugh).
I'm not gonna read them to

439
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,230
summarize. She was reflecting
on her experience in tech and

440
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,980
saying how positive it's been,
right? And she knows that

441
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,910
there's toxicity and problems
out there. And then she

442
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,910
realized, I've spent most of my
career working for myself is

443
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:00,589
what she said. And I think it
does make a huge difference.

444
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:05,900
Because you, you don't have to
play those, those politics. You

445
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:12,380
have the ability to be flexible
and to change things. And, I

446
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:18,380
don't know. I, I have this
feeling when something is

447
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,039
unfair or unjust at this point
in my life, I like to just like

448
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:26,420
yell about it really loud until
like, somebody responds to me.

449
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,240
And I know people feel weird,
like, well, you shouldn't name

450
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,140
names or whatever, like... I have
the, I have the ability to name

451
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:37,700
names. And, and I will, you know?
It's not, and I think that also,

452
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,630
you know, people who have that
ability and can do that

453
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,130
that's also really helpful for
everybody else trying to, you

454
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:49,160
know, make their way and falling
into these situations.

455
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,240
Colleen Schnettler: Yeah.

456
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:54,170
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: So I think,
can we just jump back a little

457
00:28:54,170 --> 00:29:00,650
bit to your career? So you've
worked into male dominated

458
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:06,470
industries. And that's got to be
a challenge. Like, did you think

459
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:10,519
about that at all, when you were
moving from engineering to tech?

460
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:13,910
Like, oh well, I'm moving from
this industry, and maybe the

461
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,859
experience will be similar in
this other one?

462
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,460
Colleen Schnettler: So there is
no other job where you can make

463
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,609
the kind of money we can make. I
mean, think of what we do, Guys.

464
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:26,630
We have paid like a kind of
absurd amount of money to like

465
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,230
work six hours a day in our home
office, you know? Like when you

466
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:34,309
hit this point, it is just like,
I cannot, I remember trying to

467
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:38,089
build... So I tried, I didn't ever
get a job. So I was self-taught.

468
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:40,700
I applied for that Flatiron
scholarship like three years in

469
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,779
a row. I never got it. I still
love you, Bekah. Even though you

470
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:45,980
got my scholarship, it's fine
(laugh). It worked out.

471
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,470
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Sorry (laugh).

472
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:51,869
Colleen Schnettler: I remember
when I was trying to get

473
00:29:51,869 --> 00:29:56,339
started, it was just so hard.
And then I remember talking to

474
00:29:56,339 --> 00:29:58,859
people and they were like, you
should get a job before you go

475
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:01,980
independent. And they were
totally right. My advice would

476
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,670
be whether you're a bootcamp
student, or you are self-taught,

477
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,450
your number one goal should be
to get like a real, a real job.

478
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,480
Get a full time job. Because
that's how you're going to get

479
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,619
the growth and the mentorship.
But I was never in a position to

480
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:19,589
do that. Like, my husband's gone
all the time, I had three

481
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:23,339
little kids, like I have to be,
I have to be available. I didn't

482
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:28,650
have 40 hours a week to work. So
trying to like build, build this

483
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,609
business to where I am now,
like, was so hard. And if I look

484
00:30:32,609 --> 00:30:35,789
back to like five years ago,
like, I literally cannot even

485
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:40,289
imagine myself in this position.
But despite it being a male

486
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:43,829
dominated field and like it, you
know, I like men just fine.

487
00:30:43,829 --> 00:30:46,019
Like, I don't mean to like hate
on men, I've just had some

488
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:51,869
really bad experiences. I mean,
our job is amazing. Like we, we

489
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:55,980
can work from home, we get paid
really well, we do things that

490
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,180
like, like impact the entire
world. Like, not to sound cheesy,

491
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,269
but like the internet runs the
world and we control the

492
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:08,400
internet. It's amazing (laugh). Oh
my gosh, I showed like, so, my

493
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,660
family is not at all excited
about web development. I don't

494
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,700
know why. But I showed, I showed
them the other day, like, one of

495
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,289
their, one of their friends was
having a problem with his like,

496
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,440
e-commerce site or something.
And I like, I just pulled up a

497
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,769
console and change the CSS, like
in the console so they could see

498
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:31,859
it live. And they were just like,
oh my gosh, this is amazing! (laugh)

499
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,869
I was like, you're welcome. Like,
this is fun. (laugh)

500
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:39,869
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I felt like
I made it once when my dad

501
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:43,529
called me and he was like, is
this the expected behavior of

502
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:48,660
this form? (laugh) That is not,
that should not be happening.

503
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:57,210
It's validated. (laugh)
Um, yeah. Okay. So you have this

504
00:31:53,849 --> 00:32:01,230
really long process that you've
gone through. And it sounds like

505
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:05,819
you're, you're, you're happy with
where you are. But, you know, is

506
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:07,410
it worth it for such a long
process to get there?

507
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:11,859
Colleen Schnettler: I just wish...
Okay. So my thoughts on this, I

508
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:15,640
just wish the messaging was
better on how to become a

509
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,210
software developer. I think that
I'm going through the same thing

510
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:22,660
now that I'm trying to start a
software business, like the

511
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,529
messaging is just bad on the
internet. And I feel like, five

512
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:29,890
years ago, like it was the same
way when you're trying to learn

513
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:37,539
to code. So yes. The answer, the
TL;DR is yes. It's 100% worth it.

514
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,430
But it is a slog. Like when you
are either working full time, or

515
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,250
whatever you're doing, like,
especially if you have kids at

516
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,890
home, and of course, we're in a
pandemic, so that makes it all

517
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:52,390
the more complicated, it's just
a slog. I used to have this

518
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:55,539
process where while I was doing
the dishes, I would listen to

519
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:59,049
the CodeNewbie podcasts, like
to get me pumped to go work all

520
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:04,329
night, right? To try to learn
something. And I, like I was

521
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:07,750
trying to learn something. And,
you know, I thought I was good

522
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,259
enough. And then I tried to do
open source, and I realized that I

523
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:14,529
was not good enough. And you
know, what happened to me is I

524
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:18,579
just like, there was this one
issue I could not sorted out

525
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:24,519
and I probably just, just like
sat on it for like six months.

526
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:27,069
Like, I just stopped and like,
didn't, you know, it's open

527
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:31,119
source. No one's asking me. And
this guy, like, who was one of

528
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,119
the maintainers just all he did
was send me like an email. And

529
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:37,059
he was like, hey, do you need
some help on this issue? And

530
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:41,859
that? That changed everything for
me. Like one person reach out, I

531
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:45,700
would not have made it. Like I
was, I was out. Like one person

532
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,960
reaching out, like, change the
trajectory of my whole life.

533
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,710
Like, it's so cool. So, I'm
ranting a little bit, (laugh) but I

534
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:57,579
guess my, what I'm trying to say
here is like, it's a slog. So

535
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:00,430
don't believe... There's so many
stories on the internet that are

536
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:03,970
like, I learned to code in six
months, and now I make $130,000

537
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:12,159
a year. No. Lies. It's lies. Like,
no. It's a slog. It takes a long

538
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,829
time. But when you are on the
other side, like, it's amazing.

539
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,610
Because we are, we have, I can
work from home, I can back when

540
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:25,030
there was a bus, I could take my
kids to the bus, like, I can

541
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:29,889
pick them up, like, I can do all
those things. And, you know,

542
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,980
you're gonna make pretty good
money doing it. So absolutely

543
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,619
worth it. But be prepared for it
to take years.

544
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:41,019
Dan Ott: Yeah. Yeah, that's, I
mean, the, the self-taught path,

545
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,710
you know... That's always, the one
when I say to you, it's really hard to

546
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:49,449
say, I think, out loud. It's nice
to hear you say that. It is

547
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:52,269
hard. It's hard, no matter what
path you're taking, and if

548
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:55,599
you're not doing it full time,
like, you know, if you have kids

549
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,050
or another job you trying to
change. It does. It takes a long

550
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,380
time, but you'll get there and
then it's like, once you get to,

551
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:07,239
I don't know, as I imagined the
time is different. But there's,

552
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:11,920
I feel like one spot when you're
becoming a web, or a developer,

553
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,119
I guess, where everything else
becomes much easier. Like, it's

554
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,650
like, there's this thought
process, you have to, like,

555
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:21,429
change your brain to like, learn
how to code almost. And that's

556
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:23,860
like, hard. And I think it's, it
doesn't really matter what

557
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:29,980
language you pick, or what, you
know, if it's web, or probably

558
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,179
the same for (laugh) not web stuff,
I don't know. I can't even think

559
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:37,420
of, oh, C++. That was what I learned
C++ in college for a little bit

560
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:41,230
before I dropped out. But once
we learn how to become a

561
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:46,420
developer, you know, then maybe
I'm making this up. But I feel

562
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,130
like everything else becomes
ease, like, it becomes easier

563
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:52,119
to jump, like from different
languages, you know, the,

564
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,940
if you're moving, you
know, if you're moving from

565
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,969
JavaScript to Ruby, you know,
that there's going to be like, a

566
00:35:57,969 --> 00:36:00,699
bunch of differences, you'll be confused
for a second, for a little bit. But

567
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:03,070
like, it'll, it'll click a lot
faster, you know? You'll ask the

568
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,619
right questions, you like, okay,
I know how to do this. And, you

569
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:08,409
know, I know how I would do this.
But that approach doesn't seem to

570
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:11,349
work, you know, in Rails. So
here's, you know, okay, well, I

571
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:13,300
can Google for that. And
probably there'll be an answer,

572
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:17,380
you know, like, that kind of
thing. The, the hard part,

573
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:22,030
the beginning is just like, I don't
know, re-, I don't know, resetting

574
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,119
all the, you know, the paths in
your brain, you know? I feel

575
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:25,449
like...

576
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,539
Colleen Schnettler: Yeah, and I
think once we've come through

577
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:31,019
it, it's hard to remember how
hard it was. Like, now,

578
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,599
it's like, like you said, Dan,
like taking on a new language.

579
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,610
Yeah, it's kind of hard. And
it's like, I gotta learn all

580
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,670
this new stuff. But you mostly
get it, right? Like, you can

581
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,489
mostly make it work. But like,
I think it's, it's hard to

582
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:45,420
remember, like, it's really hard
when you start. Like, with no

583
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,250
context, like, it's really hard.

584
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:54,719
Dan Ott: Yeah. No, I totally get
it. It was... Sorry (laugh), I

585
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:57,389
was just gonna say that, that was
something that, um, actually,

586
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,989
Virtual Coffee helped me
remember or realize, you know,

587
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:03,659
because it had been a long time
since I was there. But I do. I

588
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:07,050
mean, I, I remember struggling
and having no idea, you know,

589
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:10,710
what I was doing. But it is. It's
hard. Like, the kind of

590
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,989
questions you ask are much
different when you're

591
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:17,820
starting out, versus one year,
whatever, a year or two under,

592
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:23,610
you know, under your, under your
belt. And hanging out with a lot

593
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,800
of people who are learning for
the first time is, is

594
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,110
instructive, you know, and cool
to see.

595
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:31,949
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I
don't know if this, if this

596
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:36,960
tracks, because I'm not really a
musician, but we see a lot of

597
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,489
musicians moving into tech. But
I know, I know, my brother plays

598
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:43,920
a lot of instruments, right? And
learning to play an instrument

599
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,480
can be really hard. But if you
get a good understanding of how

600
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,480
to play that instrument, and a
good concept of music, then it's

601
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,449
easier to pick up the next
instrument and to learn that one

602
00:37:54,449 --> 00:37:58,260
too, right? Because there's this
idea of like, how you approach

603
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,079
it, and the pattern matching
that happens, too. And there is

604
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,440
going to be some overlap with
these different things. And in

605
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,230
your brain is kind of like,
okay. I see that there's a

606
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,780
pattern here. It's not exactly
the same, but I can get there a

607
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,769
little bit quicker.

608
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:19,739
Dan Ott: I think that's a great
metaphor, or is it an analogy?

609
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:27,090
What is difference? Doesn't
matter? Oh, well, all right. Are

610
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,070
we in a metaphor right now? Or
are we in an analogy?

611
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:30,838
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think
we're in an analogy.

612
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,539
Dan Ott: Okay. Cool. (laugh) So
that's a great analogy, Bekah. And I

613
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:39,840
think that kind of ties back or
in my head, it's, it's time,

614
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,760
what I was, what I was saying
was, was the thing that you're

615
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,219
teaching yourself is music.
Your, your asset like, you have

616
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:47,699
to be teaching yourself piano or
x at the same time, but really,

617
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:51,030
you're teaching your brain how
to music, you know? And so,

618
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,940
moving from instrument to
instrument, you don't have to

619
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,650
relearn how music works, you
know? You have to learn, you

620
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,460
know, you have to learn some new
intricacies or whatever. Like,

621
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,769
I, I played a lot of
instruments, but I never really

622
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:09,449
played any string instruments because
they're different (laugh). Like,

623
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:11,280
you have to use two hands to be
used in different ways, you

624
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,809
know? And, I mean, I'm sure,
probably could have, but you

625
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:19,710
know, I played like, every
single brass instrument, and

626
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:22,619
could just pick them up because
I don't know, it's like, it's

627
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:26,190
like all and when you're in JavaScript
or something, you know? Like,

628
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:30,150
React, Vue, and all these things
are much more similar. But even

629
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:34,409
if I jumped to violin, I, my
brain still knows music, you

630
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:37,739
know? You know, so, I don't know.
I like, I'd very much like that

631
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:42,239
analogy, Bekah. We're collecting
a series of like, really good,

632
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,210
develop, like,
programming developer journey

633
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:49,559
analogies. So because Marie had
the really good one about, about

634
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,440
cooking, you know, about being a
chef and recipes and stuff like

635
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,510
that. So I like it.

636
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:03,300
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Okay, so
you're doing consulting. And so

637
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,230
you're primarily a Rails
developer, right? But then

638
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:11,219
you've decided to tackle React,
and you're building this

639
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:15,150
product, right? And so you're like
trying to balance all these complicated

640
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,530
things.

641
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:24,789
Colleen Schnettler: (laugh) It's too much.
So, yes. So first things first. I am

642
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:28,510
committing to taking... Okay. I
didn't take this Sunday off. But

643
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,619
I am committing to taking
Sundays off. And I started doing

644
00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:37,599
that a couple months ago. And that
has been really good for myself.

645
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:41,710
So basically, I'm trying
to, I'm trying to commit to

646
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:45,280
balancing these things in a way
where I can take the weekends

647
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:48,010
off. And it's funny. So I've
started like, this is so sad I

648
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,460
have to do this, Guys. But on
Friday, I delete Twitter. Like I

649
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,829
just delete it from my phone.
It's like, because I can't have

650
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:57,130
it on my phone. I just can't.
Like, it's terrible. But then,

651
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:59,440
and so, I don't have slack on my
phone, I don't have Twitter on

652
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,760
my phone, which is really good.
So I think that's been really

653
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,139
good at helping me balance. It's
just like finding the time, like

654
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:12,010
trying to really take a step
away on the weekends. But then I

655
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,809
come back on Monday and
everyone's been hanging out all

656
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:18,820
weekend. And I'm like, oh, I miss all these
things (laugh). So there's that. But for

657
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:23,530
me, like balancing these things...
So the consulting, I have one

658
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,630
kind of long-term client, which
isn't too bad, it's like

659
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,090
maintenance. And that right now
I have a pretty intense project,

660
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:30,670
which is taking up all my time.
But it's nice, because I can do

661
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,460
it in short bursts. So I can
work really hard for three

662
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,539
months, have enough money for
six months. And then for the

663
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:41,889
next three months, focus on my
product. Or at least that is my

664
00:41:41,889 --> 00:41:46,059
master plan.
I started to learn React, and

665
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:50,829
then I just stopped because
like, I ain't got time for that.

666
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:54,639
So maybe in the future (laugh) I'll
sort that out. But uh, yeah, the

667
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:57,010
reason I started to try to learn
React is because I'm building this

668
00:41:54,639 --> 00:42:01,329
product, and I was getting a lot
of requests for a React

669
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:03,940
component. And then one of like,
my internet friends built a

670
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:06,940
React component because he
wanted it, which is awesome. But

671
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:09,699
I tell you what, I sure don't know
how to maintain it. And now I'm (laugh)

672
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:14,920
trying to make changes. And I'm like
[gasp]. So yeah, that's a bridge

673
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:17,739
I'm going to cross in the future.
Like, that, that was just too

674
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:21,730
much. Like trying to learn that,
and try to do the product, and

675
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:25,239
trying to work, and do the
podcast, and all the things was

676
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:27,909
too much. So I'm tabling that
till I have some more time. I

677
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:31,869
mean, this is like a life, like,
as we talked about earlier,

678
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:34,630
like, this is our life. So if
we're constantly in sprint mode,

679
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:40,210
like how are we going to
recover? And how are we going to

680
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:43,150
like, this is my life. Something
that occurred to me, like when I

681
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:47,199
was starting the product, and it
was really intense. It sounds

682
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:49,869
like, like, what is my goal here?
Like, yes, I want to have a

683
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:54,610
product. But if I spent the next
10 years, like heads down on

684
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:56,559
this product every weekend. Like,
the reason I want to have a

685
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:59,619
successful product is because I
want to buy a house. Like, it's

686
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:03,039
real simple. Like I want a house
with a backyard and I want my

687
00:42:59,769 --> 00:43:06,940
kids to have their own bedrooms.
Like that's (laugh), you know, that's,

688
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:09,489
that's why. And it occurred to
me, I was like, if I spent 10

689
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:12,940
years, like heads down on this
product and then sold it, even

690
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:15,250
if I sell it for $10 million, it
doesn't matter, because my kids

691
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:18,730
will almost be out of the house
by that point. And I'll have

692
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:22,030
missed what they really want
more than a house, which is to

693
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:24,699
hang out with me. So I know
that's like kind of cliche to

694
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:28,329
say, but it's true. Like it just
kind of hit me like, even if I

695
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:31,210
make $10 million. And it takes
me 10 years, it does not matter

696
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:34,630
because there'll be teenagers
and they won't wanna hang out

697
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:37,300
with me anymore. So hence the,
I'm always taking weekends off.

698
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:40,599
I'm always gonna focus on my
priorities, and I'll fit in

699
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,599
everything else as I can fit it in.

700
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,840
Dan Ott: I think that's awesome.
I, it's so hard to do, too. I mean,

701
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:50,949
I'm, it's really hard. I'm
jealous, like of your, I

702
00:43:50,949 --> 00:43:56,710
don't know. It seems like, uh, what's
the right word? There (??), it seems

703
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,840
like you're doing it, you know?
Like you're doing the weekends

704
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,050
off, and, you know, everything. And,
I don't know. Jealous is a silly

705
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,690
word. Because I know that I
could just say, oh, I'll just

706
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:08,800
take weekends off too, you know? (laugh)
Right? Yeah, it's hard. It's hard

707
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,480
to, it's hard to like, let go. I
also started with the, like the,

708
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:17,500
like you said, coming back on Mondays
and... I don't know. Everything,

709
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:22,210
everybody was hanging out, doing
cool stuff. Also, like, it's

710
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:25,960
like, I got a bunch of stuff I
want to do, you know? And it's

711
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:33,219
hard to tell myself not to (laugh),
you know? That's really awesome to

712
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:34,179
hear you talk about that.

713
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,670
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, it's
my husband was talking to me

714
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:40,960
this morning. And he was like,
you can't just... I can't, I

715
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,579
don't know how I put it, but,
you can't just sprint all the

716
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:45,670
time, right? Like you need a rest.
Everybody needs to rest. And I was like,

717
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:50,679
But no, I don't (laugh), you know? I can
just keep going. I can power through it,

718
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:53,409
right? Eventually you get a
second wind. But how many times

719
00:44:53,409 --> 00:44:57,309
you get a second wind? I mean, you
don't want one, you don't have one

720
00:44:57,309 --> 00:44:58,030
second one.

721
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:02,980
Colleen Schnettler: (laugh) And then you
collapse from exhaustion. That's

722
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:03,699
how that goes.

723
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:09,909
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah. It is like
balancing, what, the kids too, you know,

724
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:15,730
it's, there's just so much to try
and figure out and you want to

725
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:18,280
stay up on things, you want to
learn things and you want to do

726
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,429
work and you want to grow. And
then you want to hang out with

727
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:28,329
your kids. And it is just
really, really challenging to be

728
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:31,360
able to do that. And like you're
saying. You miss out on what

729
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:34,630
people are doing, or somebody
like, I learned 17 languages

730
00:45:34,659 --> 00:45:36,250
during the pandemic. What did
you learn? Like... (laugh)

731
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:41,530
Colleen Schnettler: Yeah, when I
started doing React, I bought a

732
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,929
book and I know the author
really well. So that's cool. So

733
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:47,769
I literally have the author on
like, speed dial. And one of my

734
00:45:47,769 --> 00:45:49,960
friends was like, oh, I bought
this book and I read it in a

735
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,099
weekend. And I was like, ugh, I
don't want to read a React book all

736
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:57,489
weekend. Like, I just don't. But people are
doing that, so you feel like you're getting ahead.

737
00:45:57,579 --> 00:46:04,300
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I juggling that. I can
juggling at the book. Yeah. Maybe that's how

738
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:10,449
I'll start putting myself to sleep.
(laugh) Sorry. I just, coding

739
00:46:10,449 --> 00:46:13,210
books are not my, they're not
my thing.

740
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,159
Dan Ott: I stopped buying them
a while ago. I have like, oh

741
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:18,400
yeah, you can see some of them
behind me. But I have like, a pile of

742
00:46:18,429 --> 00:46:23,590
books and I, I can never get
through them, you know? It's

743
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,800
like my free time, if I'm
actually having free time, I

744
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,380
don't want to be doing anything
related to my computer anymore,

745
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:33,369
or development or, you know,
it's like, there are all this

746
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:38,110
stuff, books and podcasts and
everything that I want to

747
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,659
consume, because I want to know
them and, you know, know the

748
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,170
material and all that stuff. But
it's just so hard. It's, there's

749
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:46,719
not enough hours, really, in
the day, you know?

750
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:48,730
Colleen Schnettler: Yeah, well, I
think we're socialized to one of

751
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,619
work all the time. So we
should figure out a way to

752
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:53,889
socialize like, like gold star,
every Sunday you don't work.

753
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:56,469
And then you can like move it to
Sunday and Saturday, double gold

754
00:46:56,469 --> 00:47:00,579
stars (laugh). Like, we need to find
a way to incentivize ourselves,

755
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,489
not to work all the time.
Because there's so much pressure

756
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:04,269
to work all the time.

757
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:09,340
Dan Ott: That's, I like that
idea that gold stars in your,

758
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:13,780
yeah, the, the like, incentives
are your health, but it like,

759
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,539
it's like a long term thing,
right? So you're never gonna

760
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:20,889
know until... The incentives will not show
up until, until much later (laugh). Yeah.

761
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,280
Colleen Schnettler: Yeah, you're
totally right. Like, it's, you

762
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,260
really won't know until it's too
late, right? Because then you'll

763
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,900
just get a pass out from
exhaustion or whatever. However,

764
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,880
everyone deals with a different
way, right? But I'm sure we've

765
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,929
all done that, where we work way
too much. And then, you know, we

766
00:47:33,929 --> 00:47:35,610
have to deal with the
ramifications of that.

767
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:39,809
Dan Ott: Yes (laugh). Yes, that
sounds familiar, vaguely.

768
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,750
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I want to
jump back just for a second. So

769
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,079
you know, we talked about like
the benefits of working for

770
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:55,199
yourself and community support.
But also, so I'm like interested

771
00:47:55,199 --> 00:48:02,280
in this question of what
qualities are important in the

772
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,070
people that you work with? So
you know, it might be your

773
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:07,710
clients, or if you can reimagine
yourself going back into the

774
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:11,699
workforce, like... What, what are
those things that make you want

775
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:14,820
to work with that person? Or
make it a safe space, a safe

776
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,690
environment for you?

777
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:18,150
Colleen Schnettler: Yeah, sure.
I've worked with a lot of people

778
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,760
doing that, because I do like a
combination of contracting and

779
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,670
consulting. So I'll drum, jump on
and augment a team for six

780
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:28,590
months to a year, or I'll work
you know, in a smaller group. So

781
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:36,179
what I look for, in people I
work with, I really, like people

782
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:41,880
who are honest, obviously, who
are, I don't want to say, well,

783
00:48:41,909 --> 00:48:44,880
like empathetic and
understanding, like my very

784
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,690
first contract job. And it was
like really exciting to get

785
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:53,429
this because I was like, really
new. It was a team. They were VC

786
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:56,039
backed. So they had a lot of
money. It was a team of like, a

787
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:01,260
bunch of like 22 year old guys (laugh).
I mean, Guys, this was like me

788
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:05,190
coming off of being a stay at
home mom, I'm what, like, 32. And

789
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:10,500
they're like, on Slack, and they
would type things like, like

790
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,460
they would just type all these
acronyms I didn't even know. It

791
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,039
was hilarious. But, okay. So
these guys, and these guys did

792
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:19,530
work all the time, which was
negative. So things I look for,

793
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:23,400
my point of bringing these,
bringing this up is despite the

794
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,230
fact that like, they were kind
of young, and they were really

795
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:29,039
excited, and they had money,
they were also like, really

796
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,190
okay, and kind of empathetic to
the fact that like my life

797
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:36,179
situation was really different
than theirs. And so when I

798
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:39,329
couldn't turn around a feature
superfast, or like when I wasn't

799
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:42,960
online on the weekends, like,
they got it. And so that's

800
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,480
really important. Like, like the
people you work with don't have

801
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,110
to be in the same life stage
you're in. But if they can at

802
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:52,860
least understand and not
penalize you for having to stop

803
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,110
work because you got to go pick
the kids up from daycare or

804
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:56,849
whatever it is, that's really
important.

805
00:49:57,809 --> 00:50:02,489
I just like people who are
honest and, you know, really open

806
00:50:02,489 --> 00:50:05,429
to learning. I think no matter
where you are in your coding

807
00:50:05,429 --> 00:50:09,809
journey, you can, there can be a
lot of give and take. I worked

808
00:50:09,809 --> 00:50:13,380
with someone else who was like,
really militant, I don't know if

809
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:19,110
that's the right word about a
specific style of coding. And I,

810
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:21,300
if I were to work with that
person again, I would push back

811
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,309
a little more on that even the
way, you know, when people

812
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:26,730
review PRs, like, there's so
much you can tell. By the way,

813
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:30,179
people review your PRs. But um,
yeah, I mean, just people who

814
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:32,969
treat you equally and fairly
like part of the team, and there

815
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:36,630
doesn't have to be a team
hierarchy and our, you know,

816
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,119
give and take, like, you can
teach them something, and they

817
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,079
can teach you something.

818
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,670
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah,
that's so great. I think, in one

819
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:48,030
of my previous jobs, I was there
for many, many years. And I

820
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:51,210
don't know that anyone ever told
me good job. And I don't think

821
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:54,570
I ever realized it until Dan and
I started working together. And

822
00:50:54,570 --> 00:51:01,650
he said, good job. And I was like, oh... Like, that
was nice, right? Like (laugh), I don't know. Just

823
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:05,489
feels good to, I don't know, it's an, it's
an acknowledgement. And it's

824
00:51:05,489 --> 00:51:08,309
simple, right? And, um,

825
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,650
Dan Ott: Yeah, I think, I think
one of the things I tried to

826
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:15,590
look out for is yet the sort of
a two way communication, you

827
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:19,940
know? Like, that's something I
value personally. It kind of

828
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:23,780
ties into everything you were
saying, but you know, being more

829
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,989
of an equal footing, even if it,
even like, yes, there's a

830
00:51:26,989 --> 00:51:31,699
client, you know, relationship, you
know, I sensibly, I'm doing work for a

831
00:51:31,699 --> 00:51:35,570
person, you know, like... I don't
know. The client's always right

832
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:37,099
or whatever, you know, but it's,
like...

833
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:39,829
Colleen Schnettler: Well, I have
hired, yeah. I have hired a

834
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:43,159
contractor who's a better
developer than I am. I hired him

835
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:47,659
to review my PRs. And like, I
loved his style, because he

836
00:51:47,659 --> 00:51:51,110
would pull out something, he'd
be like, hey, this is really

837
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,269
cool, how you did this, or, I
really liked the way this is

838
00:51:53,269 --> 00:51:56,480
structured. And then he would
bring in, but did you know about

839
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,360
this resource? Have you read
this article, like, and it was

840
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,610
just so cool, like, yay.

841
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:06,619
Dan Ott: I mean, that is
awesome. But also just the idea

842
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:11,239
that... I don't know. Being comfortable
with hiring somebody that you know

843
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:13,849
is very much better than you or
whatever, like that situation,

844
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:16,579
like the fact that you did that
is like, just such a cool thing

845
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:19,760
to me. Just as a business owner
and as like a developer and

846
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,989
somebody who, you know, wants to
keep learning, but maybe this

847
00:52:23,989 --> 00:52:27,679
is, um... Maybe it's only
strange to me? I don't know.

848
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:31,159
That's strange, but like,
surprising, or... That's not even

849
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:35,300
the right word. But the, that
like, you did it on purpose,

850
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,849
right? Like that tactical thing.
You're like, I want to go hire

851
00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:41,030
somebody to that is like much
better than me to help me and my

852
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,250
business. And that's also, I just
think that's so cool.

853
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,530
Colleen Schnettler: Yeah,
honestly, it went so well. Now

854
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,019
I'm looking for like
opportunities to do it, again.

855
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,050
I'm like, how can I hire him again?
(laugh) Like, how do we do this again?

856
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:52,460
Dan Ott: That's really cool.

857
00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:57,170
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, that
is super awesome. Okay, Colleen,

858
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:00,650
it's been really great having
you here. And so we really

859
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:04,849
appreciate you talking about
these things. And where can our

860
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:05,960

861
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,019

866
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:26,630
the first time I ever met you,
we were doing like co-working

867
00:53:26,659 --> 00:53:31,400
in the Moms Can Code and your
handle was leenyburger and I'm

868
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,960
pretty sure I called you Leeny.
So... (laugh)

869
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:37,699
Colleen Schnettler: (laugh) It's a terrible
handle. Like, I had no idea that,

870
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,000
like, Twitter was a real thing
when I signed up. And now it's

871
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,130
like I'm stuck with it for life.
So, oh well... (laugh)

872
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:45,650
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: You can't
get away from it. (laugh)

873
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,699
Dan Ott: I think it's great handle,
by the way. I think it's awesome.

874
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:51,559
Colleen Schnettler: Thanks. (laugh)

875
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:52,849
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I'm sorry
I called you Leeny. (laugh)

876
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,909
Colleen Schnettler: I don't even
remember. I do remember you were

877
00:53:55,909 --> 00:53:58,550
like on the treadmill or
something while we were, we were

878
00:53:58,550 --> 00:53:59,210
co-working.

879
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:00,800
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Exercise
bike. Yeah.

880
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,019
Colleen Schnettler: I was pretty
impressed. I was like, oh, nice.

881
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:06,090
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: (laugh) Trying
to, trying to get it all in.

882
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,219
Colleen, it's been great having
you here. And we're really

883
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:15,960
