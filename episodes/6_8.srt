1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,650
Bekah: Hello and welcome to
season six, episode eight of the

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,028
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah, and this is a podcast that

3
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:16,748
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:19,388
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:19,388 --> 00:00:22,478
coding journey, and they're here
on this podcast sharing their

6
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:25,207
stories and what they've learned,
and we're here to share it with

7
00:00:25,207 --> 00:00:28,088
you. Here with me today is my
co-host, Dan.

8
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:30,647
Dan: Wuddup Bek? How's it going?

9
00:00:31,268 --> 00:00:33,707
Bekah: It is. It's going alright.
How's it going with you?

10
00:00:34,097 --> 00:00:37,878
Dan: It's going great. We just
finished recording with Shelley

11
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:42,908
McHardy. Uh, she's a front end
developer at Rightpoint, Shelley

12
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:46,768
transitioned from being a, uh,
high school chemistry teacher to

13
00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:49,527
her current role, um, a couple
years ago, I think, around when

14
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:52,048
Covid started, which is when a
lot of, I think, transitions

15
00:00:52,107 --> 00:00:55,618
happened. And, um, so yeah, she
shared with us her. Journey, you

16
00:00:55,618 --> 00:01:00,118
know, uh, learning about coding
and doing some, uh, a bootcamp

17
00:01:00,122 --> 00:01:02,698
and Collab Lab. And then we
talked a lot about the interview

18
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:03,567
process as well.

19
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:08,257
Bekah: Yeah, she had a lot of
really great points about how to

20
00:01:08,257 --> 00:01:12,278
navigate that interview process
and shared really candidly about

21
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:16,897
how hard it could be, and I
really appreciated that she was

22
00:01:16,897 --> 00:01:19,597
open with that. Cause I think
that, you know, we talk about how

23
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:23,722
great it is to get into tech and.
We don't talk enough about how

24
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:28,373
difficult it is and sharing these
stories can really help to, um,

25
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:30,653
empower other people as they go
through that journey as.

26
00:01:32,112 --> 00:01:35,923
Dan: Yeah, I agree. Like hearing
about these, these journeys and,

27
00:01:35,923 --> 00:01:39,462
and you, you start, um, we've
talked to a few people who've had

28
00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:44,263
these sort of long and kind of
hard interview processes, uh, and

29
00:01:44,293 --> 00:01:48,162
you start to hear some of the
same, similar, you know, similar

30
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:50,653
things happening across, across
all of the interview process. And

31
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:53,442
so it was, it was interesting to
hear her thoughts about that. And

32
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:58,468
we talked a little bit at the end
about. About the, the, the state

33
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:00,837
of this, the interview process
in, in the tech world, you know,

34
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:03,597
and, and maybe how, how we can
try to improve it a little bit

35
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,257
down the line.

36
00:02:05,013 --> 00:02:07,563
Bekah: Yeah. If you have any
ideas for that, leave us a

37
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:07,983
comment.

38
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:12,867
Dan: leave us a comment on

39
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:17,953

start this episode of the podcast

58
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,509
like we start every other Virtual
Coffee podcast episode, and how

59
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:12,419
we start every Virtual Coffee. We
introduce ourselves with our

60
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,409
name, where we're from, what we
do, and a random check-in

61
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:18,659
question. So we help you enjoy
this episode.

62
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:20,444
Dan: That was a great segue.

63
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:25,245
Bekah: It's my, my one and only
talent,

64
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:27,675
Dan: You do. You are very good at
segues.

65
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,014
Bekah: Today's random check-in
question is, what was your least

66
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:42,064
favorite food as a child? Do you
still hate it or do you love it

67
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:46,655
now? My name is Bekah. I am a
technical community builder from

68
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:54,064
a small town in Ohio, and I think
that I liked a lot of food, but I

69
00:03:54,425 --> 00:04:02,060
did refuse to eat any red meat
or. Pork other than bacon, Uh,

70
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:08,389
for like from the time I was 11
until the time I was 21. Um, so

71
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:12,439
I, I didn't hate it. I just
didn't want to eat it. I do eat

72
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,810
it now, but it is also not my
favorite. I, I enjoy chicken in

73
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,009
fish still a lot. So that's it.
I'm boring.

74
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,579
Dan: Uh, Alright, well, hi, I'm.
I do web development in

75
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,959
Cleveland, Ohio, and um, yeah, I
don't know if I ever had like a

76
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,240
least favorite food, but the one
that popped into my mind, a food

77
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,050
that I did not like, and now I
like, uh, was green beans. Um,

78
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,860
like I, and I think part of that
was, I am pretty sure that

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,480
growing up we weren't eating like
fresh green beans, you know, they

80
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,310
were, you know what I mean? They
were like canned or whatever.

81
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:51,305
Bekah: you eat green bean
casserole, though? I love green

82
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:52,055
bean casserole.

83
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,439
Dan: I probably avoided it
because I just didn't like green

84
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,079
beans. You know what I mean?
Like, there's just, there's just

85
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,379
that thing. But, uh, now, like,
especially like a, like crispy,

86
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:03,860
like a, not crispy, but crunchy,
I don't know, whatever, but fresh

87
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,139
green beans, you know, Like not
like, Especially if they're not

88
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,009
overcooked. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Exactly. They got a little

89
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,439
crunch to 'em. I'm big fan these
days.

90
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:17,574
Shelley: Hi, I'm Shelley. I am a
front end developer in Atlanta,

91
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:22,283
Georgia, and I'm gonna have to go
with spinach. And again, just

92
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:25,134
like your canned green beans
stand. My mom used to do

93
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,394
disgusting things to spinach, and
it was not, not edible. Um, like,

94
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,293
just, just awful. She told a
story, I don't remember it

95
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:37,194
anymore, but she, she still does
vivid. That she, the dog would

96
00:05:37,194 --> 00:05:40,074
eat anything. And so she mixed up
a bunch of cooked spinach with

97
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:42,624
dog food and said, If the dog
eats it, you guys have to eat it.

98
00:05:42,624 --> 00:05:47,394
And we said, Deal. The dog picked
around the cook spinach and just

99
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:50,574
ate all the kibble and we never
had to eat cooks spinach again.

100
00:05:50,903 --> 00:05:52,074
Dan: Uh, That's hilarious.

101
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:54,473
Shelley: which I love now. I
mean, likes pane and stuff, if

102
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:56,394
it's cooked well, not just smosh

103
00:05:56,994 --> 00:05:57,293
Dan: right.

104
00:05:57,744 --> 00:05:57,894
Shelley: So

105
00:05:58,043 --> 00:05:59,093
Dan: Yeah. It's like the spinach.

106
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:02,619
Bekah: Somebody of Virtual
Coffee, I think on Tuesday was

107
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:05,468
talking about how they used to
eat canned spinach with a little

108
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:07,478
bit of salt on it. I was like,
uh,

109
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:08,514
Shelley: Oh, no.

110
00:06:08,798 --> 00:06:11,079
Dan: Yeah, that's, Yeah. No, no.
That's the kind of thing that

111
00:06:11,084 --> 00:06:14,199
like the maybe previous
generation or whatever was, you

112
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,149
know, would eat, uh, or like, I
just remember, um, Popeye, you

113
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:22,028
know, cartoon and he, there was
always a can and it just came out

114
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:24,608
in like a mush, you know, like,
and he would just like slrp it

115
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:26,769
down and that's, that's what I
think of when I think of, yeah,

116
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:27,129
that.

117
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,199
Bekah: that's how I used to eat
it when I

118
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,069
Dan: from back in the day.

119
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:32,348
Bekah: My grandma used to say,
she was like, If you eat this,

120
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:35,829
can you'll be really strong. And
I was like, Okay. Then like I

121
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:36,848
wanna be strong

122
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:39,639
Shelley: and my brother and I
were like, I don't care. I'll be

123
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:40,009
weak.

124
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:44,528
Bekah: It's what I should have
done. I was a little bit

125
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:48,939
gullible, I think. Um, well,
thanks for being here with us

126
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:51,069
today, Shelley. We're really
excited to have you on the

127
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:57,468
podcast. Uh, we start every
episode of the podcast. All

128
00:06:57,468 --> 00:07:00,218
right. I like my, I started
watering and now I'm like crying.

129
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:02,288
I'm not crying for any reason.

130
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:04,959
Shelley: You're so happy that I'm
here.

131
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:09,293
Bekah: it. I was just so happy.
Um, it is an involuntary physical

132
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:15,653
response to how happy I am to
hear your, uh, origin story. So

133
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:20,064
go ahead and, and kick us off
with how you got to this place in

134
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:20,694
your career.

135
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:23,754
Shelley: My orange origin story,
now I have to decide if I'm the

136
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:25,223
hero or the villain. Okay.

137
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:26,723
Bekah: you can be both.

138
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:34,194
Shelley: Now a good guy, always.
Um, let's see. In my past life I

139
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,024
was a high school chemistry
teacher. Um, and even that was a.

140
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:45,129
Unplanned event. Um, I actually
wanted to be Indiana Jones a

141
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:47,108
hundred percent. I was an
anthropology.

142
00:07:47,153 --> 00:07:47,843
Bekah: Love that.

143
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:51,879
Shelley: Yeah, uh, I wasn't
gonna, The worst thing about

144
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,149
anthropology, so I have to say
that I'm really grateful that I

145
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:59,468
discovered other paths because I
can't stand hot and I can't stand

146
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:03,488
beating down sun. So, you know,
and every, every movie has

147
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:07,778
prepared you to dig up dinosaurs,
you know, in the desert, eat. So

148
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,468
it's good that it didn't work
out. Um, I took chemistry

149
00:08:11,468 --> 00:08:15,639
accidentally, um, because I had
to take a lab science to

150
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:19,209
transfer. Uh, the four year
university I wanted to go to, I

151
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:21,908
went, started at community
college and so I'm like, Okay,

152
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:25,538
I'm gonna take this bone head
chemistry class. And for morons,

153
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:29,949
I think it was called that. Um,
and I completely loved it. Uh,

154
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:33,698
and I don't know why I missed out
in high school, but I did. And

155
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:36,639
then I took another one and I
realized that the teacher made

156
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,698
all the difference and the
environment of you can make

157
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:43,778
mistakes. This is hard. That's
okay. You're not dumb. Um, and I

158
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:47,019
thrived and changed everything.
So I became that teacher and I

159
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:49,749
loved it. And I thought that I
would grow old teaching

160
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:54,489
chemistry, you know, and, uh,
doing fireballs in my lab as an

161
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:59,828
80 year old woman. Um, but public
education is not, uh, All it's

162
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:03,249
cracked up to be. Um, and I do
not wanna turn this into a

163
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:06,938
conversation about that, so we'll
just put that one aside. Um, I

164
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:09,759
tried a lot of special programs,
a lot of special things. I did

165
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,229
some amazing stuff. I met
incredible kids. Um, I loved it.

166
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:19,078
I missed it every day, but it
wasn't gonna grow old doing it.

167
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:23,558
So, um, at co right at the
beginning of Covid, about six or

168
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:28,178
eight months in, I decided that.
Or I should say my mental health

169
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:31,808
and physical health decided that
I wasn't gonna keep doing it. And

170
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:34,089
so I took a leave of absence and
thought, you know, I'm just gonna

171
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:38,349
get better, gonna take a break
and then figure out where to go

172
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:45,519
back. And for fun, because I'm
this kind of nerd, um, got an edX

173
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,509
course, I think every Python for
everybody or something,

174
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:52,629
something, one of those little 10
hour courses. Not a, not a legit

175
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:57,683
anything. It reminded my computer
programming classes in college

176
00:09:57,683 --> 00:10:01,224
and I was like, I used to love
this. Why have I like stepped

177
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:04,734
away? I mean, did a lot of tech
stuff in, in the classroom, but

178
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:10,854
not programming. And, uh, I found
boot camps. It completely changed

179
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:14,484
the search algorithms on all
social media, and that's all I

180
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:18,413
saw. And I hadn't even known what
they were. So I did some research

181
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:22,043
and I found one at Georgia Tech
that sounded amazing for my

182
00:10:22,043 --> 00:10:25,884
learning style. It was virtual,
which was required. There was no

183
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:28,943
way I was going into a classroom
at that point. This was early

184
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:36,114
2021. And. I, uh, it was virtual,
it was live classes with an

185
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:41,844
instructor, and their whole thing
was that they, um, broke out into

186
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:44,153
breakout rooms so you could
practice. So they teach for 10 or

187
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:46,913
15 minutes and ask questions, and
then they send you in a group of

188
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:50,033
three or four people. And it was
just this cycle for three hours

189
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:54,293
at a time, you know, three times
a week. And it really worked for

190
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:58,764
me as far as the way I learn and
the way I work. Um, yeah, so I

191
00:10:58,764 --> 00:11:03,668
did that. Went to my first
virtual. Last summer, heard about

192
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:10,808
Virtual Coffee, found you all,
new home, new family. Um, yeah,

193
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:13,298
Took about a little over a year
to get my first job,

194
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:15,854
Bekah: What conference was that?
If you don't mind

195
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:17,019
Shelley: refactor tech.

196
00:11:17,714 --> 00:11:17,953
Bekah: Oh.

197
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,548
Shelley: Yeah, so I don't know if
you know it, it's a little local

198
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:26,739
Atlanta one. Yeah. And um, it was
virtual that year cuz everything

199
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:29,859
was, um, in fact I'm not going
this year cuz this year it's

200
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:34,058
completely back in person. I'm
kind of, I think virtual

201
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:37,629
conferences were the best thing
that came outta c Um, and there's

202
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:39,999
still some hybrid ones, but now
people are going back a hundred

203
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,808
percent in person and I'm just
not wired for that anymore. Or at

204
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:48,563
least not yet. Wait for this new
vaccine to. Show us how good it

205
00:11:48,563 --> 00:11:48,953
is,

206
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,548
Bekah: Yeah. Do you think that if
Covid hadn't hit you would still

207
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:54,068
be teaching?

208
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:59,634
Shelley: Ooh, that's a good
question. Um, I would not still

209
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,384
be teaching in the same place
because I was definitely unhappy

210
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:08,229
there with the way things were
changing. Um, I think I am still

211
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:12,038
teaching. That's the funny thing.
Um, as soon as I got outta

212
00:12:12,038 --> 00:12:15,339
bootcamp, they reached out and
said, Do you wanna be a ta? So I

213
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:20,528
was a TA for my bootcamp, the
following cohort, um, I've start,

214
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:22,989
I've started volunteering for
Virtual Coffee, for lunch and

215
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:27,668
learn. Um, I've become the
coordinator at Collab Lab for the

216
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:32,573
career lab. The little two week,
um, extension stuff they do. I

217
00:12:32,573 --> 00:12:35,933
will always be a teacher. That's
just, that's how I'm wired. I

218
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:40,134
think that's what I like about,
um, software development and tech

219
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,614
and how much, not, maybe not
everywhere, but at least the

220
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:46,464
places that I've gotten involved
with, how much teaching is just

221
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:50,604
sort of part of how it's done.
Um, I doubt at this point I'd

222
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:54,474
still be in a classroom teaching
chemistry. Yeah. That's, that's,

223
00:12:55,553 --> 00:12:58,658
that's passed I think,
unfortunately. Or maybe I'll go

224
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:00,999
back to it. Who knows? Or maybe
I'll go back and teach computer

225
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,438
science. That could be fun.

226
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:07,568
Dan: I like that. Yeah. Or you
could, Yeah, maybe you could, uh,

227
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:12,219
do, I don't know what, what you
call it, but like I'm sure

228
00:13:12,219 --> 00:13:14,288
there's teaching positions that
aren't, you know, like aren't the

229
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:16,958
whole full time thing. Right. And
like, cuz just come in and teach

230
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:17,889
a class or something,

231
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:21,849
Shelley: Ooh. Or summer coding
programs for girls. Stuff like

232
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:24,999
that would, that's definitely in
my future without a doubt.

233
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:29,693
Dan: yeah. That'd be awesome that
I just really loved how you said

234
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:32,783
that cuz the teaching, the
teaching aspect of, of this like

235
00:13:32,783 --> 00:13:35,183
development. And you're right,
like not everybody does it. Not

236
00:13:35,188 --> 00:13:39,024
everybody wants to do it and
that's perfectly fine. But it is

237
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:42,173
one of those things that um, when
you find the right, like places

238
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:44,813
in the right communities, you
know, there, that that's almost

239
00:13:44,813 --> 00:13:48,264
always one of. Parts of our, of
like the communities that feel

240
00:13:48,264 --> 00:13:50,783
good, at least to me, right, Is,
is people like being willing to

241
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:54,474
teach even, especially if it's
not like a, a position or

242
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:56,244
something, like an official
thing, right? But just people

243
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:59,153
sharing knowledge, you know? Uh,
it's, it's cool. It's,

244
00:13:59,153 --> 00:14:02,813
Shelley: Yeah, it's a, it's an
amazing thing. That's my two, my

245
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:06,354
two big communities, Virtual
Coffee and Collab Lab. It's just

246
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:10,673
that it's constantly sharing
information, asking questions,

247
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:16,539
you know, pairing up on all sorts
of things. It's amazing. Um, I

248
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:19,869
don't think the rest of the world
is like that. I don't know. Um,

249
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,109
I'm sure people answer questions,
but it's not, it's not part of

250
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:24,058
it. It's not built in.

251
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:27,188
Dan: Right. I, I, I mean, I think
I agree with you. I mean, I don't

252
00:14:27,188 --> 00:14:31,509
have any experience with other
careers, but like the, you know,

253
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:34,178
my, my wife is, uh, she's had a
few different jobs over the last

254
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:38,649
however many years and, you know,
she does, um, data science stuff

255
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:42,308
and it's, it's like programming
adjacent, you know, certainly,

256
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:46,899
like she did her current job, uh,
actually is on GitHub now. Like

257
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:50,379
they are like sharing, sharing.
Um, I don't know what it is.

258
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:53,994
Sequel schemes maybe or
something. I'm not sure what

259
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,214
they're doing, you know, But, but
it is that, but it's still, but

260
00:14:56,214 --> 00:15:00,533
there's not like that expectation
and that, um, I don't know. It's

261
00:15:00,538 --> 00:15:02,964
still not the same, you know, It
isn't like, just the way she

262
00:15:02,964 --> 00:15:05,453
talks about it and the way that,
like, they're all like, work, you

263
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:08,844
know? It's very different than a
lot of software organizations.

264
00:15:09,254 --> 00:15:11,663
It's, it's, it's a weird thing.
I, I think that a lot of other

265
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:14,703
industries or whatever could,
could learn a lot from, from.

266
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:18,264
Shelley: Definitely there's some
overlap with teaching and

267
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:22,014
teachers. Um, there was a new
trend. It was probably, it's

268
00:15:22,014 --> 00:15:24,533
probably called something
different today, and 20 years ago

269
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:26,423
it was called something
different, but when I learned it,

270
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:30,519
it was called PLCs, Professional
Learning Communities. and it was

271
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,629
a set of protocols and mindsets
where you came together and

272
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:39,099
shared your work, shared your
blockers. I mean, it, it really

273
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:45,999
has a lot of overlaps with, um,
the way that the tech space and

274
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:51,009
engineering talks about things
now. Um, retrospectives, you

275
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:54,158
know, all, all of those little
parts, there's a lot of overlap

276
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,678
with how teachers collaborated.
Um,

277
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:58,658
Dan: What was it called? What was

278
00:15:58,778 --> 00:16:01,928
Shelley: P Professional learning
communities. I think you nodded

279
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:02,889
back. I don't know if you,

280
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:04,668
Bekah: I've definitely heard of
that before.

281
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,058
Shelley: Yeah. Um, I'm sure they
call it something different now,

282
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:10,869
cuz that's kind of how the
education industry works is, you

283
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,599
know, put a new label on it every
10 years. I guess a lot of

284
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,119
industries were like that. Yeah.
Rebrand it. Call it something

285
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:18,969
new. It's everybody's favorite
thing. Um, it was really funny

286
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:21,668
when I first started teaching,
that's what veterans would teach,

287
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,464
tell. Of like, Yeah, we've seen
it all. There's nothing new. And

288
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:28,134
I was gung-ho and like, No, no,
this is new. I love this. This is

289
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:30,894
brand new. You've never seen
anything like it before. And then

290
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:33,173
I turned into that person of
like, Yeah, yeah, we've seen it

291
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:39,234
all before But yeah, that's the
greatest thing about my new job

292
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:43,553
is the first time it started out
as a training thing where

293
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:46,673
everybody comes in and they train
for not everybody, but this one

294
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,134
program I started called
Jumpstart. It was eight weeks of

295
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:52,599
training. It just got you used to
a lot of different things and

296
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:55,538
then you got assigned to a team,
so now you're thrown in, you're

297
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:59,349
the new one. Um, and the first
time I paired with someone or

298
00:16:59,354 --> 00:17:02,229
shadowed someone, I was kind of
terrified cause I'm like, they're

299
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:06,818
gonna think I know stuff and I
don't know anything Um, and it

300
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:11,499
was beautiful. He was talking
about what was going on. He asked

301
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:14,739
like, Have you seen this before?
Are you familiar with this? I

302
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:18,608
mean, it was just, and. Just a
developer, he's, he's not a

303
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:24,759
teacher. He wasn't taught how to
deliver new content, how to make

304
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:28,898
things feel risk free. You know,
he doesn't have the pedagogy that

305
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:33,249
a teacher has. He was just a
natural and it was amazing. And

306
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:36,459
then I paired with somebody else
and it was kind of the same

307
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:40,388
thing. Everybody I've worked with
on my team, I'm very lucky, has

308
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:46,719
sort of been that way. It's like
learning is part of their, Whole

309
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:51,489
culture and it's real. It's not
just, uh, you know, we say we do

310
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:54,429
this and then you're left on your
own. Um, so I

311
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:56,648
Bekah: love that. I think that's
so important to have that

312
00:17:56,653 --> 00:18:00,759
culture, that it, that everybody
is on the same page rather than,

313
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:03,669
I think some places say like we
have a learning culture and then

314
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:07,348
they force people to, to teach
when they don't want to, or

315
00:18:07,348 --> 00:18:10,794
they're like, In addition to all
of these other tasks that totally

316
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:14,753
fill your day, you also have to
teach now and we're not going to

317
00:18:14,753 --> 00:18:18,384
support you in knowing how to
really do that effectively. And

318
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:23,153
then you see so many negative
situations that come out of that,

319
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:27,923
you know, people feeling, um, not
confident with their own skills,

320
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:31,493
thinking that, you know, I'm not
ready for this job or this

321
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:36,023
career, or whatever. But really
it's an issue with the culture

322
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:37,104
that's not supporting.

323
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:41,378
Shelley: Mm-hmm. and it's not
authentic. Yeah. Go.

324
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:45,713
Bekah: Yeah, sorry. Um, I just
wanted to backtrack to Collab Lab

325
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:49,344
because you mentioned it and I
think they're doing great stuff.

326
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:52,104
And for our listeners who aren't
familiar with Collab Lab, can you

327
00:18:52,104 --> 00:18:56,634
just give kind of an overview of
what it is and what you did at

328
00:18:56,993 --> 00:19:00,203
where, where were you in your
journey from bootcamp to First

329
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:01,943
job working with collab?

330
00:19:02,163 --> 00:19:06,144
Shelley: mm-hmm. Oh, I'd love to
tell the world about Collab Lab.

331
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:14,409
Um, so it is. It's an in between,
it's post boot camp, but it's not

332
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:18,219
really an apprenticeship or an
internship. The program was built

333
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:21,788
by Andrew and Stacy and probably
a couple other people I'm

334
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:26,499
forgetting, um, a few years ago
because they realized that boot

335
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:30,429
camps were the thing that's, this
is, they grew huge. That's where

336
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:35,814
a lot of new engineers were
coming from. We don't wanna talk

337
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:39,023
hours about boot camps, but
they've got a lot of positives.

338
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:42,534
You learn a lot of stuff. You're
exposed to a lot of stuff. You

339
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:45,983
build some skills, but they don't
teach you how to work as an

340
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:48,233
engineer. And I guess you could
probably say that about

341
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:51,144
undergraduate programs too. You
don't learn how to work on a

342
00:19:51,144 --> 00:19:54,804
team, you don't, you know, learn
how to deal with that kind of

343
00:19:54,804 --> 00:20:00,713
stuff. So Collab Lab's goal is to
give you a more real world

344
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:06,848
experience. Getting a full story
of a project that you're supposed

345
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:10,118
to build, um, a team of
developers. So it's a group of

346
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:15,068
four developers and the tickets
are all already done for you. Um,

347
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:17,709
and the acceptance criteria, and
you kind of have to figure it

348
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:21,128
out. So it's not all perfect, at
least sanitized, like, like your

349
00:20:21,128 --> 00:20:24,038
homework assignments and
bootcamp, and you have a little

350
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:27,909
bit of freedom to, you know, make
mistakes and go your own path.

351
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:32,709
You're, you. It's not dictated
exactly what techniques you're

352
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:36,638
supposed to use. It's react, it's
fire base. The rest is up to you.

353
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:38,828
Do whatever you want, whatever
packages you think you're gonna

354
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:43,239
need, whatever path you're gonna
take. Um, and you build, It was a

355
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:47,288
shopping app, I think it still
is. Um, and you have mentors

356
00:20:47,294 --> 00:20:50,949
assigned. So you get three
mentors, which is an amazing

357
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:56,199
ratio. Like professional support
to newbies. So it's four

358
00:20:56,199 --> 00:21:02,348
developers and three mentors, and
we did it in week long sprints.

359
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:05,769
So you decide your tickets. We
worked in pairs. It's all about

360
00:21:05,773 --> 00:21:10,298
pair programming. Um, and so we
paired up and we changed partners

361
00:21:10,298 --> 00:21:13,148
each week and we went through our
ticket and we're supposed to

362
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:18,624
spend about four or five hours a
week. Um, and then, We'd have a

363
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:21,054
retro at the end of each week.
Oh, we also have an office hours.

364
00:21:21,054 --> 00:21:23,784
I forgot about office hours. So
you have a chance to, to meet

365
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,844
with your mentor and just talk
about problems or whatever. And

366
00:21:26,848 --> 00:21:30,804
it's all communication over
Slack. I mean, the support is

367
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:33,173
unreal. I know I'm kind of like
just bouncing all over the place

368
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,804
instead of just presenting. But I
get filled with a lot of emotion

369
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:41,858
when I think about this program
and I can't stay on track. So

370
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:46,239
then at the end of the week we
have the retro, um, you demo the

371
00:21:46,243 --> 00:21:53,138
little piece that you built. Um,
and then um, we also had some, I

372
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:56,108
think there were a couple little
workshop type things on stuff.

373
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,259
Like we had one workshop on
accessibility cuz that's not

374
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:04,358
covered well in, um, boot camp.
They basically try and fill all

375
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:07,598
these little holes and to give
you some real experience and

376
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:11,243
confide. Um, and so that's an
eight week program, and they do

377
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:16,223
four cohorts a year. And then at
the end of the eight weeks, um,

378
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:19,074
you've got a project, you've got
an amazing project to put on

379
00:22:19,074 --> 00:22:24,054
your, um, portfolio that's not
like everybody else's, you know,

380
00:22:24,173 --> 00:22:28,673
Pomodoro timer and sh I was gonna
say shopping list to-do list.

381
00:22:28,703 --> 00:22:33,203
That's it. The infamous to-do
list that everybody's built. Um,

382
00:22:33,263 --> 00:22:36,354
so you have a, you know, more
unique fun project and a lot more

383
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:40,719
to talk. Then the last two weeks,
if you're interested, is career

384
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:43,838
lab. And that's the part that
I've gotten involved with because

385
00:22:43,838 --> 00:22:47,648
that changed everything for me.
Um, you spend a week doing

386
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:50,378
similar type things. You have
some tasks, you meet with a

387
00:22:50,378 --> 00:22:54,909
couple of men, volunteer mentors,
um, to update your LinkedIn is

388
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:59,048
the first week and the second
week is interviewing, which

389
00:22:59,048 --> 00:23:03,999
nothing they do in bootcamp
prepares you for interview. So,

390
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:07,989
um, you get to watch mock
interviews. You get a bunch of

391
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:11,199
practice interview questions.
They pair you up with another

392
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:14,769
collaby, that's what we're
called, um, so that you can sort

393
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:18,189
of practice your answers. And
then you do two practice

394
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:21,729
interviews, a behavioral and a
tech interview. There's even a

395
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:25,239
tech project that you build and
then go into the interview to

396
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:30,398
present what you did. So it's
much more realistic, um, and.

397
00:23:31,854 --> 00:23:36,233
Tech interviews were, were my, my
killer thing. I had several of

398
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:40,374
them before and after and during
Collab Lab, and that's where I

399
00:23:40,374 --> 00:23:47,483
tanked. Um, my brain would shut
down. I could, could not, um, I

400
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:50,723
couldn't code anymore. It's like
I knew nothing like, and, and it

401
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:55,673
was just awful experience. And so
I kept doing it. Everyone told me

402
00:23:55,673 --> 00:23:58,763
that's what it was gonna be like
and I kept pushing through. Um,

403
00:23:58,794 --> 00:24:01,644
but I never got better at them.
There were a couple of good ones

404
00:24:01,644 --> 00:24:05,423
because the interviewers treated
it like para programming, but

405
00:24:05,423 --> 00:24:10,374
mostly it was some dude sitting
back in dead silence watching me

406
00:24:10,374 --> 00:24:16,433
burn and I just don't respond
well to that. So when we went

407
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:23,288
through career lab, um, they kind
of showed us how to. Tell our

408
00:24:23,288 --> 00:24:27,909
story how to lead the interview a
little bit, to say the things we

409
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:31,989
wanted to say, um, where to take
chances, you know, stuff like

410
00:24:31,993 --> 00:24:38,169
that. Um, and I had an interview
about three or four weeks after I

411
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:43,239
think the career lab with my
current employer. And I just, I

412
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:46,179
channeled the whole thing. I'm
just like, I'm going to do this,

413
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:52,828
this way. And it was phenomenal.
It was like magic. Um, I, I, I

414
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:57,759
felt great. I did fantastic.
Every question he asked, I

415
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:02,048
understood and could answer. I
felt, I felt really, really good.

416
00:25:02,108 --> 00:25:04,209
And I had a couple other good
interviews too, so I ended up

417
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:08,048
getting two offers. Um, yeah. And
so I got to choose. That was the

418
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:11,858
craziest thing after a year of,
you know, fingernail biting. I

419
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:15,519
got two offers in a week and got
to pick the one that I liked,

420
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:15,638
The.

421
00:25:16,358 --> 00:25:18,759
Bekah: That's really awesome and
we were chatting a little bit

422
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:23,798
before we started recording about
the difference between, um,

423
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,239
interviewing and preparing for a
job in tech versus other careers

424
00:25:28,689 --> 00:25:31,628
and how it is so different. Can
you talk a little bit more about

425
00:25:31,628 --> 00:25:31,929
that?

426
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:36,459
Shelley: Sure. Um, the biggest
difference is how many rounds of

427
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:40,388
interviews. I think because I've
had a lot of teaching interview.

428
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:45,038
Before I was a teacher, I had all
kinds of weird jobs all over the

429
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:50,348
place, um, in different
industries. And it was typically

430
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:57,068
one interview, possibly a second.
But I feel like I've been, every

431
00:25:57,068 --> 00:26:00,338
job I've gotten, I think was one
interview. You know, they, they

432
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:03,249
saw your resume, they chatted
with you on the phone for a few.

433
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:08,513
You sat fast to face to face for
half an hour. An hour, and maybe

434
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:10,614
you didn't get the offer right
then, you know, maybe they slept

435
00:26:10,614 --> 00:26:15,534
on it, but you didn't get called
in again and again and again. You

436
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:20,784
don't have to perform. Hmm,
perform, That's the right word.

437
00:26:20,784 --> 00:26:26,663
You don't have to perform live.
And it's funny cuz I'm a teacher,

438
00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:28,913
I'm used to performing live,
that's what I do. But in

439
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,903
something I'm an expert in, you.
Give me, give me an interview for

440
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:35,844
a teaching job today. I'm gonna,
I haven't done it in two years,

441
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,423
but I guarantee I'll knock
everyone else out of the water.

442
00:26:38,903 --> 00:26:45,864
But I'm a newbie. I'm a beginner.
I'm a novice. I love it. I love

443
00:26:45,864 --> 00:26:50,963
it when something works. I think
JavaScript is loads of fun. Um,

444
00:26:51,413 --> 00:26:55,854
but I don't know it like that. So
you ask me something live and I

445
00:26:55,854 --> 00:27:02,094
choke. So many rounds of that is,
is traumatizing. I don't know any

446
00:27:02,094 --> 00:27:06,173
other word for it. Like the first
couple rounds are fine and the

447
00:27:06,173 --> 00:27:10,044
behavioral interviews, I always
did fine. Um, but as soon as it

448
00:27:10,044 --> 00:27:12,773
started getting technical, it's
like I don't know this well

449
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:17,183
enough to be tested. And it's a
test, really a test.

450
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:20,409
Bekah: that's a good point. I
think there was one role I

451
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:24,638
interviewed for where I went
through six interviews, and then

452
00:27:24,638 --> 00:27:29,558
didn't get the job. I was like,
Oh, wow, that, that was really,

453
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:34,959
really intense. Um, but, but
you're right. I've never had

454
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:39,759
that. else? I think tops. I've
had three interviews for

455
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:43,419
something and the last was
probably more of a compensation

456
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:47,078
interview. You know, talking
through that kind of stuff. But

457
00:27:47,378 --> 00:27:50,769
the process is, and it seems
pretty standard that you just

458
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,368
continually go through these
rounds and it does get really

459
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:58,388
intense and stressful. And I
remember somebody on Twitter

460
00:27:58,388 --> 00:28:02,753
early in my career. Calling it
soul crushing. And I thought,

461
00:28:02,753 --> 00:28:05,784
well, it can't be that bad. And,
and then what I had to do, I was

462
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:11,183
like, Oh yeah, yeah, it is, It is
that bad, like It's really

463
00:28:11,183 --> 00:28:16,284
exhausting and it's, especially,
I, you know, mentioning that you

464
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:18,473
had different kinds of
interviews, like where some

465
00:28:18,473 --> 00:28:23,453
people would just sit back and
like, Stare at you. And you know

466
00:28:23,483 --> 00:28:29,034
how, I don't know how they expect
people to perform in that

467
00:28:29,034 --> 00:28:33,503
situation when you're already
nervous. I think that you should

468
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:37,314
be doing your best to support the
person on the other side of the

469
00:28:37,314 --> 00:28:41,483
screen so you can see how they
perform at their best. You know,

470
00:28:41,483 --> 00:28:45,203
because you're, you're not going
to be in that situation most days

471
00:28:45,203 --> 00:28:50,064
where it's awful and somebody is
really putting the pressure on.

472
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:54,953
Shelley: Someone described it to
me as hazing and that clicked.

473
00:28:55,344 --> 00:28:59,243
So, and, and there are, it, it, I
had both experiences. There were

474
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:03,384
definitely people who were
interviewing so that I could show

475
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:07,433
my best. Um, definitely. And then
we would just reach a point where

476
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:11,453
I'd, you know, maxed out my
knowledge and. Me personally

477
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:15,354
didn't handle that well. Um, and
some people told me that that's

478
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:19,913
part of it too. Like how do you
respond when you don't know what

479
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:23,753
to do? And even then, it's so
artificial because it's like, if

480
00:29:23,753 --> 00:29:26,273
I don't know what to do, I'm
gonna send you a message, call

481
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:29,574
you, whatever, and go, Hey, I
can't figure this out. But you

482
00:29:29,693 --> 00:29:32,394
don't feel comfortable doing that
with a complete stranger when a

483
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:38,648
job is on the line. So yeah, I
definitely have likened it, tots

484
00:29:39,098 --> 00:29:44,138
and all sorts of traumatic stuff
when I finally signed the

485
00:29:44,144 --> 00:29:48,219
contract and it was official and
done and I wasn't gonna start for

486
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:51,219
about five weeks. That's another
thing that's really different in

487
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:54,159
tech too, that you might not
start for weeks and weeks because

488
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:58,148
they just have their onboarding
schedule or whatever. Um, I

489
00:29:58,148 --> 00:30:02,993
collapsed. I just stopped.
Anything. And I gave myself

490
00:30:02,993 --> 00:30:08,574
permission to, I was like, this
was the craziest ride ever. Um,

491
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,993
and it's funny, everyone's like,
Oh, it's a full-time job to get a

492
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:17,604
job. It's maybe not full-time,
but the stress and the psychic

493
00:30:17,604 --> 00:30:22,403
energy involved, uh, is
exhausting as working 40 or 60

494
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:25,973
hours a week. There's no, no
doubt about it. And there's a lot

495
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:31,449
of when it rains at pores. I had
one week where I was juggling. I

496
00:30:31,449 --> 00:30:35,679
think five or six applications
all in different places. Like one

497
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,548
was make the perfect, you know,
cover letter all the way to this

498
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:42,459
is the final tech interview and
you're gonna present something

499
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:45,939
that you've built over the course
of a week. Like just, it was

500
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:49,088
nuts. Um, so yeah, that is kind
of like a full time job.

501
00:30:50,894 --> 00:30:55,044
Bekah: When I always. Try and
encourage people to take time off

502
00:30:55,074 --> 00:30:58,884
in between jobs and starting
their new job. And a lot of it's

503
00:30:58,884 --> 00:31:02,903
for that reason because it's,
it's important to get kind of

504
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:06,804
healthy habits set up, especially
if you're working from home. Um,

505
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:13,463
finding that space to be able to
navigate in between your job. and

506
00:31:13,554 --> 00:31:17,273
your home life can be really
challenging, but because that

507
00:31:17,273 --> 00:31:22,463
interviewing stress can be so
intense, uh, it, it's good to

508
00:31:22,469 --> 00:31:25,913
breathe before you jump right in.
And it sounds like you had a

509
00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:30,473
pretty good onboarding experience
with your eight week jumpstart.

510
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:31,663
Shelley: Jump start. Yep.

511
00:31:31,663 --> 00:31:35,094
Bekah: That sounds really great,
rather than, than just being

512
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:39,398
thrown into All right. Here's
some work. Now do it you

513
00:31:39,624 --> 00:31:40,183
Shelley: figure it.

514
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:43,749
Bekah: equally stressful because
you don't know how to communicate

515
00:31:43,749 --> 00:31:47,378
or what the process for things
is. And it sounds like Jumpstart

516
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:51,368
helped to establish good paths of
communication.

517
00:31:52,314 --> 00:31:55,163
Shelley: Yeah, it's a, it's an
amazing program and it is a

518
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,733
program. It's something that
right point, that's my company,

519
00:31:59,124 --> 00:32:03,324
uh, developed like three or four
years ago. So they've had, you

520
00:32:03,324 --> 00:32:07,973
know, about eight cohorts at this
point. Um, and they've found that

521
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:13,838
it's just, A really good way to
bring in new engineers, you know,

522
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:17,739
junior level that don't know
anything. So we're all either

523
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:20,679
bootcamp grads or recent grads,
or were a couple of computer

524
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:24,878
science grads too. Um, most of us
had jobs in other industries, so

525
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:29,979
that part of the skill set we
had, um, we just hadn't worked,

526
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,614
you know, on an engineering team.
Agile development and all of

527
00:32:34,614 --> 00:32:38,784
that, and sprints. So we got to
learn that and shadow people all

528
00:32:38,784 --> 00:32:45,683
over the company, um, and work
through training stuff and also

529
00:32:45,683 --> 00:32:48,953
had assignments and, you know, we
were cohort, it was a really

530
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:54,713
great way to do it. Um, and so it
felt kind of like school, but on

531
00:32:54,713 --> 00:32:58,513
the job. Um, and then when we got
put on a team, we're still

532
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:03,669
consider. Um, you know, novices.
So I've been doing new training

533
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:07,538
cuz you know, there's things that
my team uses that other teams

534
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:12,489
don't use. I've been learning
about Optimizly, um, and will

535
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:16,628
probably be the, the person on
the team that knows the most in a

536
00:33:16,634 --> 00:33:20,078
couple of months because I got
that, that task of learn

537
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:25,298
optimizly so that we can start
using it on our, uh, project. Um,

538
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:31,509
so that's been fun and. Just,
it's been great, actually. You've

539
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,479
caught me at a really, really
good week. I have to brag for a

540
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:39,009
minute. I haven't, I haven't
shared this in, uh, tech spaces

541
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:46,449
yet. Um, today's Thursday, so on
Tuesday, I, uh, put in my first

542
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:52,838
PR as a professional engineer and
it has, it's only gotten reviewed

543
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:55,358
and approved once. It's not
merged yet, so that's what I'm

544
00:33:55,358 --> 00:33:57,729
waiting for the merge before I
make the official announcement.

545
00:33:57,729 --> 00:34:01,929
But, So excited because it was
something that I wrote all by

546
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:05,798
myself. They wanted, and it,
they, that's, that's part of it

547
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:07,419
too. This is part of the learning
thing. They don't just throw you

548
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:11,619
at the code base and say, Figure
it out. Um, the first task I was

549
00:34:11,623 --> 00:34:15,728
given was there's something that
they do manually every time

550
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:19,628
that's tedious copying and
pasting of translations. Cuz

551
00:34:19,628 --> 00:34:23,568
we're a global company, so every
time. Launch a site. It's the

552
00:34:23,568 --> 00:34:27,829
same site for a different country
or language. Um, everything has

553
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:30,798
to be translated, Every single
button, every single everything

554
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:34,759
description has to have a new
translation. And we're not gonna

555
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:39,528
build a whole new site for it. So
they just do this manually. They

556
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:45,708
send a CSV to a translation team,
they get the 800 translations,

557
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,798
and then somebody copies and
paste them into a file. And so

558
00:34:48,798 --> 00:34:52,673
they're like, We need to
automate. Shelley do it. I'm just

559
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,974
like, are you kidding? I don't
know the code base. I don't know

560
00:34:55,974 --> 00:35:01,614
anything. You want me to do this?
Okay, cool. So I built a cli, um,

561
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:06,414
and I'm so proud of it and it
works and I might be demoing it

562
00:35:06,414 --> 00:35:10,074
this morning. Yeah. So, and, and
it's not that big a deal anyone

563
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,813
else would look at. It would be
like, Oh, that's cute.

564
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,914
Bekah: No, that's a big deal.

565
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:14,873
Shelley: it's mine,

566
00:35:17,318 --> 00:35:20,528
Bekah: Then I have a big impact I
think, on the processes there and

567
00:35:20,528 --> 00:35:24,548
making people's lives easier. So
I think that's really, really

568
00:35:24,554 --> 00:35:25,059
important.

569
00:35:25,509 --> 00:35:28,478
Shelley: Yeah. Other people will
use it maybe once a month for the

570
00:35:28,478 --> 00:35:33,128
next six months and then it'll go
away. But that's okay.

571
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,204
Bekah: Yeah. Um, so, okay. So
you've been through this whole

572
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:43,884
process and I think that you've
shared a lot of really great

573
00:35:43,884 --> 00:35:49,103
information and I appreciate you
sharing your story. Um, so what

574
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:55,074
advice would you give to somebody
who is maybe towards the end of

575
00:35:55,074 --> 00:35:59,034
their bootcamp and thinking about
what the next step should.

576
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,967
Shelley: It's, it's, I think it's
really an individual thing. So I

577
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:09,367
think the best advice I could
give is asking yourself what

578
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:13,327
exactly you want and what's
important to you. Um, because

579
00:36:13,327 --> 00:36:15,878
where you're at in life's gonna
make a difference. I've had this

580
00:36:15,878 --> 00:36:19,507
conversation actually with
someone at the Collab Lab of, you

581
00:36:19,628 --> 00:36:24,233
know, what next? If you are young
and you don't have kids or

582
00:36:24,233 --> 00:36:28,193
responsibilities, you know,
you're in a very different place

583
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:31,853
in your career no matter what
field you're in. But definitely

584
00:36:31,853 --> 00:36:35,063
in tech, you know, you could sign
up with one of those two year

585
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:38,362
contract programs where they
train you and hire you out and

586
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,753
you make crap money, but get
great experience, but you have to

587
00:36:41,753 --> 00:36:45,353
live someplace weird or you don't
get a good enough salary, um, and

588
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:49,327
you're stuck for two years. I'm
not at that place in my. I got a

589
00:36:49,327 --> 00:36:53,768
little paranoid towards the end
of this journey. It took seven

590
00:36:53,768 --> 00:36:57,338
months after bootcamp to get my
job. Um, so somewhere around the

591
00:36:57,338 --> 00:37:01,538
five or six month mark was like,
um, maybe I am gonna sign up.

592
00:37:01,688 --> 00:37:05,438
Maybe, maybe that is what I'm
gonna do. Um, but something in me

593
00:37:05,438 --> 00:37:11,407
all along said, You need to find
the place that fits you. And

594
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:17,617
being assigned a contract for a
client wasn't. Achieve that. Even

595
00:37:17,617 --> 00:37:19,507
if I didn't care about the money,
even if I didn't care about the

596
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:23,257
flexibility, I wasn't gonna get
to pick where I went. And I

597
00:37:23,257 --> 00:37:26,527
realized that was critically
important. And honestly, the, the

598
00:37:26,532 --> 00:37:29,737
interview process taught me that
too. I met some amazing people

599
00:37:29,737 --> 00:37:33,668
and I met some horrible people.
Like, Okay, yeah, you made me cry

600
00:37:33,728 --> 00:37:36,338
and I don't wanna work for you.
You know, like, thank you for

601
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:39,097
that. He took a half an hour
after the crying to go, Okay,

602
00:37:39,097 --> 00:37:44,288
wait. Thanks for that. I don't
wanna work for you. Um, so for

603
00:37:44,288 --> 00:37:49,717
me, So if a person is like me,
interviewing the company, finding

604
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:54,577
that spot, really doing your
research of who they say they

605
00:37:54,577 --> 00:37:58,208
are. And then once you get into
the interview process, if they're

606
00:37:58,213 --> 00:38:00,967
gonna force you to do five
interviews, force them to do five

607
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:05,887
interviews. Ask them the
questions, really dig into who

608
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:10,358
they are and what they're about.
Um, because for me that was what

609
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:13,088
was I decided was most important.
I needed to find a place where

610
00:38:13,092 --> 00:38:18,862
the people. Felt right. You know,
the product would be nice too.

611
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:22,163
You know, I ended up in
eCommerce. That's not a thing I

612
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:26,693
ever would've predicted at all.
I'm all about education and

613
00:38:26,693 --> 00:38:30,112
nonprofit and, you know,
whatever. And I love these

614
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:34,222
people. I mean, they're, they're
amazing and they're, it's, it

615
00:38:34,222 --> 00:38:37,672
just so happens that commerce is
their thing. So now commerce is

616
00:38:37,677 --> 00:38:44,168
my thing until the next thing
comes around. Um, but. also

617
00:38:44,557 --> 00:38:47,288
finding people, I guess that's it
too. This is, could be really

618
00:38:47,288 --> 00:38:51,577
isolating. It's amazing that we
can do this all virtually. Um,

619
00:38:51,637 --> 00:38:56,677
but that also means that you're
all by yourself. So you have to

620
00:38:56,677 --> 00:38:59,887
find communities, you have to
find other people that are in the

621
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:03,007
same boat as you. That's why
Collab Lab was so good. Cause

622
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,773
it's filled with people. That are
looking for their first role or

623
00:39:06,773 --> 00:39:09,893
just found their first role, or
are there to support people

624
00:39:10,103 --> 00:39:15,083
finding their first role. Like
that's the entire focus. Um, and

625
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:21,983
in a really loving, supportive,
fun way, not a, you know,

626
00:39:22,342 --> 00:39:25,643
commercial way. The way the, the
career services in boot camp are

627
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:28,643
where they're just, we're gonna
get you a job, so apply to 800

628
00:39:28,643 --> 00:39:34,583
things, but honestly, that works
for some people too. You. The

629
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:37,793
numbers game of applying to every
single thing and hoping something

630
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:43,552
sticks. Um, I got turned off of
that really, really quick, so I

631
00:39:43,552 --> 00:39:48,083
just got really picky and hoo, I
had my schedule. I gotta find one

632
00:39:48,088 --> 00:39:52,762
or two things, three things a
week that really mean something

633
00:39:52,762 --> 00:39:56,753
and apply to them. Um, oh. And
cover letters. Cover letters,

634
00:39:56,782 --> 00:39:58,793
cover letters, cover letters. I
don't care what anyone says, they

635
00:39:58,793 --> 00:39:59,032
make a.

636
00:39:59,612 --> 00:40:00,182
Bekah: I love cover

637
00:40:00,393 --> 00:40:02,693
Shelley: and if they don't make a
difference, then you don't need

638
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:03,273
to work there.

639
00:40:05,088 --> 00:40:08,467
Dan: That, that, that advice
about, um, getting picky about

640
00:40:08,467 --> 00:40:11,557
things. You know, you're not the
first person on the podcast to

641
00:40:11,557 --> 00:40:14,047
have that advice. And I think
it's, it makes a lot of sense to

642
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:19,268
me. You know, I, you can get.
Like numbers, game approach, you

643
00:40:19,268 --> 00:40:22,208
know, can make some sort of logic
sense. You know, I mean, like, I

644
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:25,927
can understand the logic behind
it, but the, everyone that we've

645
00:40:25,932 --> 00:40:29,467
talked to that has gone through
like a, a long and especially

646
00:40:29,472 --> 00:40:32,963
like a hard journey like that,
um, I think comes out on the

647
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,333
other side. Like they finally,
like some people, like were

648
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:38,092
throwing out thousands of
interviews and then eventually

649
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,523
started getting picky, you know?
And, and some people started that

650
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:43,432
way to start. But it seems like
the people that are happy with

651
00:40:43,432 --> 00:40:47,063
their roles, you know, after the
awful journey of the interview

652
00:40:47,063 --> 00:40:48,983
process, you know, the people
that have found, like the people

653
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,132
that, the companies that they
liked, um, have all been, they've

654
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:55,463
all said this similar things of,
you know, find, find companies.

655
00:40:57,202 --> 00:40:59,302
Either the people or the, the
product or whatever are

656
00:40:59,302 --> 00:41:02,152
meaningful and do the research
and all that stuff and, and yeah.

657
00:41:02,152 --> 00:41:05,273
Yeah. Narrow your scope. Um, I
think that's great. I mean, I

658
00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:05,822
think that's great.

659
00:41:06,503 --> 00:41:09,773
Shelley: I mean, it's, it's
tough. It's big risk because, you

660
00:41:09,773 --> 00:41:13,268
know, it's really expensive to be
unemploy. and if God forbid,

661
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:16,538
you're actually working a job
while trying to find a job, I, I

662
00:41:16,538 --> 00:41:20,257
couldn't even imagine that. I was
very, very, very lucky that, you

663
00:41:20,257 --> 00:41:24,248
know, my wife had health
insurance and I had savings so I

664
00:41:24,253 --> 00:41:28,447
could work a part-time TA job and
do just fine for seven months.

665
00:41:28,478 --> 00:41:33,157
Um, and I know not everyone can
do that. Um, and it might take

666
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:38,858
more than seven months. I think I
also got really lucky. Um, But

667
00:41:38,858 --> 00:41:41,467
yeah, I'm really, I'm really,
really glad that I was picky,

668
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,737
that I kept telling myself
that's, that's what I needed to

669
00:41:44,737 --> 00:41:47,347
do. And there was always a little
voice going, You're being stupid.

670
00:41:47,347 --> 00:41:50,498
Just get a job. You know, this
is, this is, this is not real.

671
00:41:50,768 --> 00:41:54,307
Um, you're not gonna be able to
find the right job this way. And

672
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:57,938
then it works. So, not very
scientific, but I'm gonna say

673
00:41:57,938 --> 00:41:58,688
yes, do it that.

674
00:41:59,422 --> 00:41:59,753
Dan: Yeah.

675
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:03,262
Bekah: I think, you know, that
that point that you made about

676
00:42:03,262 --> 00:42:06,862
having support behind you is
really important, um, especially

677
00:42:06,862 --> 00:42:11,182
to new folks who are coming into
tech because I think that there's

678
00:42:11,182 --> 00:42:14,663
often these promises that tech is
this goldmine and you're gonna

679
00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:19,112
find a great job and a great
career and, and it will. You

680
00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:21,813
know, help you with your life
situation. So we see so many

681
00:42:21,813 --> 00:42:25,413
career changers, and then they're
doing this thing where they do

682
00:42:25,413 --> 00:42:29,882
have seven months and they can't
find a job. And so they're, I

683
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:33,813
think it's really important that
we talk openly about, like, it's

684
00:42:33,813 --> 00:42:38,103
hard, first of all, um, you're
going to have to go through this

685
00:42:38,103 --> 00:42:40,952
really rigorous interview
process, and then after that you

686
00:42:40,952 --> 00:42:44,972
might not get a job. So you need
to plan on taking, I would say at

687
00:42:44,978 --> 00:42:51,938
least six. To look for a job. Um,
and then also I think that it can

688
00:42:51,938 --> 00:42:56,197
really impact relationships with
the people who are close to you.

689
00:42:56,288 --> 00:42:59,827
You know, because they're
supporting you as you're going

690
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,947
through this situation. And I've
seen relationships break up

691
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:06,367
because the partner says, Oh
yeah, I am totally supportive and

692
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:10,447
I am here for you. But without
really understanding how

693
00:43:10,447 --> 00:43:14,197
stressful this situation can be,
and hey, I'm really sorry, but

694
00:43:14,197 --> 00:43:17,688
I'm gonna have to put. Four more
hours tonight because I've gotta

695
00:43:17,688 --> 00:43:22,097
get this take home test done so I
can go to this job interview. And

696
00:43:22,097 --> 00:43:27,378
I know, you know, uh, my husband
Jesse was a career transitioner

697
00:43:27,378 --> 00:43:31,788
before I was into tech. And at
the time I didn't understand it.

698
00:43:31,788 --> 00:43:34,637
You know, he was like going to
work and then coming home I'm

699
00:43:34,668 --> 00:43:38,302
like, Oh, I've gotta do free code
camp and all this stuff. I. Dude,

700
00:43:38,302 --> 00:43:43,193
I've been with the kids all day,
like And then once I came into

701
00:43:43,193 --> 00:43:47,932
tech, it, it all made a lot more
sense. Like, Oh, now I understand

702
00:43:47,932 --> 00:43:52,193
this, but I wasn't prepared for
that in terms of like being a

703
00:43:52,197 --> 00:43:55,612
supportive partner and knowing
where that would get us as a

704
00:43:55,612 --> 00:43:58,853
family and like, this is a
investment, but it's, it's gonna

705
00:43:58,853 --> 00:43:59,152
be hard.

706
00:43:59,978 --> 00:44:02,887
Shelley: Yeah, my wife said
something. It was a couple weeks

707
00:44:02,887 --> 00:44:08,438
after, um, I got the job before I
started and, uh, you know, one of

708
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:12,233
those heartfelt moments and she.
You're incredibly strong. And I'm

709
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:16,733
like, What are you talking about
I'm just like, I cry so much, you

710
00:44:16,733 --> 00:44:21,202
know, or whatever. And she's
like, The last seven months you

711
00:44:21,202 --> 00:44:25,643
worked so hard and it was so
uncomfortable and so painful, and

712
00:44:25,882 --> 00:44:29,302
so traumatic, and so emotional
and, and just, you know, all of

713
00:44:29,302 --> 00:44:32,918
these things. And she goes,
Besides the fact, Shocked

714
00:44:32,918 --> 00:44:37,568
everything and learned this new
thing. Like you put it all out

715
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:42,757
there. Um, and I was like, Oh
gosh, you're right. I guess I am.

716
00:44:43,117 --> 00:44:48,248
Um, yeah, I don't think anyone
can get just how hard it is. And

717
00:44:48,248 --> 00:44:52,237
I'm sure lots of career
transitions are tough. Um, but

718
00:44:52,237 --> 00:44:55,838
yeah, this, this particular one
comes with a huge amount of hype

719
00:44:56,168 --> 00:45:02,543
and fanfare and the slog is not
something. You know, you're

720
00:45:02,543 --> 00:45:06,172
necessarily prepared for and the
rejection. Oh goodness. I've

721
00:45:06,172 --> 00:45:07,943
never been rejected for so many
things.

722
00:45:09,027 --> 00:45:10,148
Bekah: it's worse than high
school.

723
00:45:10,943 --> 00:45:15,112
Shelley: Yeah. Like, I mean, I, I
get it, I get it. Totally. You

724
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,512
know, you're gonna, I'm not the
perfect fit. I don't have a

725
00:45:17,518 --> 00:45:19,972
problem with that. But there's
something about that third or

726
00:45:19,978 --> 00:45:23,362
fourth interview and you're like,
Oh, I've gotta have it now. No,

727
00:45:23,422 --> 00:45:27,052
that's, that's still the
beginning of the process. Um,

728
00:45:27,112 --> 00:45:29,213
because there were a lot of times
where I made to the third or

729
00:45:29,213 --> 00:45:32,182
fourth step, and. Didn't go
further, so

730
00:45:33,402 --> 00:45:36,943
Bekah: Yeah, I was invited to
apply for two positions a while

731
00:45:36,947 --> 00:45:41,443
back, and I didn't get either of
those positions and they also had

732
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:46,572
really long interview processes,
and I was talking to, um, a, a,

733
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:52,543
um, partner who owns a
consultancy afterwards and just

734
00:45:52,543 --> 00:45:55,902
saying, This was really tough. He
was like, Yeah, it's really, it's

735
00:45:55,907 --> 00:45:59,407
really mind blowing that you
didn't get either of those. Yeah,

736
00:45:59,557 --> 00:46:04,208
it's like They're like, Well, it
came down between you and one

737
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:06,307
other person. I'm like, Well,
that's great. Like,

738
00:46:06,893 --> 00:46:10,733
Shelley: Oh yeah, I got one of
those, actually, it was really, I

739
00:46:10,733 --> 00:46:13,793
got the form letter email that
said it came down to one other

740
00:46:13,793 --> 00:46:20,123
person and he actually, the put a
PS at the end. I could read

741
00:46:20,123 --> 00:46:23,693
between the lines he wanted me
with somebody else or whatever,

742
00:46:23,693 --> 00:46:26,422
wanted the other person. So it
was really clear and said

743
00:46:26,422 --> 00:46:29,782
something like, If you ever need
mentorship, reach out. I mean,

744
00:46:30,202 --> 00:46:37,643
and again, it was that reminder
of, of um, just how good parts of

745
00:46:37,648 --> 00:46:42,592
this industry and community are
like that mentorships built in.

746
00:46:43,507 --> 00:46:47,288
Not always, not always perfectly,
but that, that was like a, a

747
00:46:47,293 --> 00:46:50,347
totally normal thing for him to
offer. And from my perspective

748
00:46:50,617 --> 00:46:54,427
coming in, that's so generous
that this is a person you

749
00:46:54,427 --> 00:46:57,907
interviewed, you, you spent an
hour and a half with them, you

750
00:46:57,907 --> 00:47:01,148
know, and you're offering to have
coffee, meet up with them and

751
00:47:01,148 --> 00:47:04,327
help 'em in their career. Like
that's just crazy, but also

752
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,137
wonderful.

753
00:47:05,858 --> 00:47:11,527
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, it's, it that,
um, so thinking about it from the

754
00:47:11,527 --> 00:47:13,688
other side, like I, I, well, I
haven't hired a lot of people,

755
00:47:13,688 --> 00:47:17,617
but again, my wife has gone
through the hiring process of, of

756
00:47:17,827 --> 00:47:20,797
fair number of times over the
last year or two, and. She's had

757
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:24,007
those same struggles, like she
really loves a person and you

758
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,157
know, somebody else, whatever.
And, and it's, it's hard on them.

759
00:47:27,217 --> 00:47:29,768
Like, it's hard on everybody.
Like the whole process is just

760
00:47:29,768 --> 00:47:34,538
hard, you know? Like, and that
doesn't, I don't think, probably

761
00:47:34,538 --> 00:47:37,898
make it easier to feel like to,
to accept the rejections, you

762
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:40,867
know? But it's just like this
whole process is just a

763
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:43,597
nightmare, you know, like, I
don't know what we could do to

764
00:47:43,597 --> 00:47:46,358
fix it, but like, it is, it's so
hard. It's so like emotionally

765
00:47:46,362 --> 00:47:50,077
fraught, you know? I don't. I
don't know. I don't really have a

766
00:47:50,728 --> 00:47:52,117
a suggestion to fix it, but it,

767
00:47:52,117 --> 00:47:54,367
Bekah: I feel like part of this,
like what we're doing right now

768
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:59,378
is, uh, making a way to fix it,
right? Having open conversations

769
00:47:59,382 --> 00:48:02,737
about these things, talking about
the problems, talking about our

770
00:48:02,742 --> 00:48:07,447
experiences to help other people
through the situation is, is a

771
00:48:07,447 --> 00:48:10,748
start to making an improvement
with how the industry does

772
00:48:10,748 --> 00:48:11,168
things.

773
00:48:11,617 --> 00:48:13,958
Dan: at least prepare people for
it. you know.

774
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:17,047
Shelley: Well, and acknowledge
the people that do it better, The

775
00:48:17,047 --> 00:48:19,958
interviewers that do it better,
they need to get that feedback

776
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:23,378
too. Um, so that more, more do
that. Yeah.

777
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,838
Dan: Yeah. Like the, the dude
that, the dude that would sit and

778
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:28,297
watch you and glare at you right,
when you're doing your interview.

779
00:48:28,628 --> 00:48:32,527
Like, it's such a, it's such a, I
mean, it's bad just like as a

780
00:48:32,527 --> 00:48:35,168
person, you know? I mean, it's
obviously just like not a nice

781
00:48:35,168 --> 00:48:37,538
thing to do, but it's also like
it's a bad advertisement for

782
00:48:37,538 --> 00:48:42,547
their, for their employer, you
know? And. Uh, I don't know. And

783
00:48:42,547 --> 00:48:45,757
that is like, that actually is a
problem in tech is that lots of

784
00:48:46,177 --> 00:48:50,018
people in the hiring process are
not, they're not like HR people.

785
00:48:50,137 --> 00:48:52,327
They're not like people that are
doing hiring at smaller, at

786
00:48:52,327 --> 00:48:55,688
smaller places and can, and tech
is like a lot of small shops,

787
00:48:55,688 --> 00:49:00,518
right? And so you just have
developers like just get told,

788
00:49:00,518 --> 00:49:03,637
Hey, run this interview. You know
what I mean? With no training,

789
00:49:03,637 --> 00:49:06,398
you know, or anything like that
probably. And, uh, that's a

790
00:49:06,398 --> 00:49:08,157
problem too. I don't know.
There's problems everywhere.

791
00:49:08,498 --> 00:49:10,807
Shelley: Yeah, but let's start
fixing 'em.

792
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:12,097
Dan: All right,

793
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:15,398
Bekah: All right, Shelley, thank
you for spending time with us

794
00:49:15,398 --> 00:49:19,327
today. Do you have any last bits
of wisdom or any wins you wanna

795
00:49:19,327 --> 00:49:20,288
share before we go?

796
00:49:22,057 --> 00:49:25,748
Shelley: Oh, just that I think
I'm about to go do a demo. So

797
00:49:26,077 --> 00:49:31,297
that's my, my, uh, my win that
I'll, I've done a lot of demos,

798
00:49:31,297 --> 00:49:34,297
but they've all been, you know,
mock demos. This will be the

799
00:49:34,297 --> 00:49:36,907
first time I share something that
I've built, so I'm really excited

800
00:49:36,913 --> 00:49:37,478
about that.

801
00:49:37,568 --> 00:49:38,047
Dan: awesome.

802
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:41,438
Shelley: and uh, yeah, I think
Virtual Coffee's probably

803
00:49:41,438 --> 00:49:45,577
responsible for a lot of it.
That's how I found, um, uh,

804
00:49:45,577 --> 00:49:49,208
Collab Lab, cuz Ayu um, talked
about it. I'm like, What is this

805
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:52,628
thing you're talking about? And I
think it was like the day before

806
00:49:52,628 --> 00:49:57,097
the deadline for the cohort that
I signed up for. Yeah. So it all

807
00:49:57,097 --> 00:50:01,657
comes around. That's my advice.
Meet people, talk to people. Come

808
00:50:01,657 --> 00:50:02,527
to Virtual Coffee

809
00:50:02,902 --> 00:50:05,413
