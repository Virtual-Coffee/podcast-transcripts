00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,500
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello and
welcome to Season 6, Episode 8

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:07,650
of the

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,028
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah, and this is a podcast that

3
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:16,748
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:19,388
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:19,388 --> 00:00:22,478
coding journey, and they're
here, on this podcast sharing

6
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:24,700
their stories and what they've 
learned. And we're here to share

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,088
it with you. Here with me today
is my cohost, Dan.

8
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:30,647
Dan Ott: Wuddup, Bek? How's it
going?

9
00:00:31,268 --> 00:00:33,500
Bekah: It is -- it's going
alright. How's it going with

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:33,707
you?

10
00:00:34,097 --> 00:00:37,878
Dan: Yeah. It's going great. We
just finished recording with

11
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:42,908
Shelley McHardy. She's a front-end
developer at Rightpoint. Shelley

12
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:46,768
transitioned from being a
high school chemistry teacher to

13
00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:49,527
her current role a couple
years ago, I think, around when

14
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:52,048
Covid started. Which is when a
lot of, I think, transitions

15
00:00:52,107 --> 00:00:55,618
happened. And, so yeah, she
shared with us her journey, you

16
00:00:55,618 --> 00:01:00,118
know, learning about coding,
and doing some -- a bootcamp

17
00:01:00,122 --> 00:01:02,698
and Collab Lab. And then we
talked a lot about the interview

18
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:03,567
process as well.

19
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:08,257
Bekah: Yeah. She had a lot of
really great points about how to

20
00:01:08,257 --> 00:01:12,278
navigate that interview process
and shared really candidly about

21
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:16,897
how hard it could be. And I
really appreciated that she was

22
00:01:16,897 --> 00:01:19,597
open with that. Cuz I think
that, you know, we talk about how

23
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:23,722
great it is to get into tech, and
we don't talk enough about how

24
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:28,373
difficult it is. And sharing
these stories can really help to

25
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:30,653
empower other people as they go
through that journey as well.

26
00:01:32,112 --> 00:01:35,923
Dan: Yeah, I agree. I- I like hearing
about these- these journeys and-

27
00:01:35,923 --> 00:01:39,462
and you s- you start -- we've
talked to a few people who've had

28
00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:44,263
these sort of long and kind of
hard interview processes. And

29
00:01:44,293 --> 00:01:47,500
you start to hear some of the
same -- si- similar, you know,

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,162
similar

30
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:50,653
things happening across- across
all of the interview process. And

31
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:53,442
so it was- it was interesting to
hear her thoughts about that. And

32
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:56,700
we talked a little bit at the
end about just -- about the

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,468
[laughs] the- the- the state

33
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:00,837
of this -- the interview process
in- in the tech world, you know?

34
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:03,597
And- and maybe how- how we can
try to improve it a little bit

35
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,257
down the line.

36
00:02:05,013 --> 00:02:07,563
Bekah: Yeah. If you have any
ideas for that, leave us a

37
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:07,983
comment.

38
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:12,867
Dan: [Chuckles] Leave us a
comment on ... twit- Twitter?

39
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:16,000
Bekah: Well, Twitter would be a
good place to it. [Dan laughs]

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,423
Or- or on the- the podcast
episode.

41
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:20,937
Dan: Oh, yeah.

42
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:21,643
Bekah: Wherever they're
listening.

43
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:23,457
Dan: Oh, like a review?

44
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:26,293
Bekah: Well, you can leave a
review with a comment about-

45
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:27,300
Dan: Yeah. But you-

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,500
Bekah: -how to improve --

47
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,453
Dan: -have to do a review?

46
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:31,752
Bekah: Well, we also what --
like reviews. We love reviews.

47
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:33,312
Dan: [Laughs] Well, definitely
give us reviews.

48
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,573
Bekah: If you're listening, give
us a review.

49
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:38,700
Dan: And then, af- yeah. In your
review, tell us how to fix the 

50
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,700
interview process as well
[chuckles].

51
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,842
Dan: Yep. We'll- we'll read
those. For sure.

51
00:02:43,152 --> 00:02:45,862
Bekah: And hit us up on Twitter,
VirtualCoffeeIO [chuckles].

52
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:50,564
Dan: Yeah. I'll -- also, other
places, I'm sure [chuckles].

53
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,979
Bekah: Lots of places. We're-
we're around.

54
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,000
Dan: Yeah [chuckles]. Listen to
the end of the episode for all

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,574
of the different

55
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:57,615
places that we've listed, that
you can contact us at [laughs].

56
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,560
Bekah: But if you wanna hear the
rest of this episode, you should

57
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,919
definitely listen. And we're gonna
start this episode of the podcast

58
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,509
like we start every other Virtual
Coffee Podcast episode, and how

59
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:12,419
we start every Virtual Coffee. We
introduce ourselves with our

60
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,409
name, where we're from, what we
do, and a random check-in

61
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:18,659
question. So, we hope you enjoy
this episode.

62
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:20,444
Dan: That was a great segue.

63
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:25,245
Bekah: [Bekah and Dan chuckle]
It's my- my one and only talent.

64
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:27,675
Dan: [Chuckles] You do. You are
very good at segue.

65
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,014
Bekah: Today's random check-in
question is, what was your least

66
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:42,064
favorite food as a child? Do you
still hate it or do you love it

67
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:46,655
now? My name is Bekah. I am a
technical community builder from

68
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:54,064
a small town in Ohio. And I think
that I liked a lot of food, but I

69
00:03:54,425 --> 00:04:02,060
did refuse to eat any red meat
or pork, other than bacon,

70
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:08,389
for like from the time I was 11
until the time I was 21. So --

71
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:12,439
I- I didn't hate it. I just
didn't want to eat it. I do eat

72
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,810
it now, but it is also not my
favorite. I- I enjoy chicken and

73
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,009
fish, still. A lot. So that's
it. I'm boring.

74
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,579
Dan: [Laughs] Alright. Well, hi,
I'm Dan. I do web development in

75
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,959
Cleveland, Ohio. And yeah, I
don't know if I ever had like a

76
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,240
least favorite food. But the one
that popped into my mind, a food

77
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,050
that I did not like, and now I
like, was green beans.

78
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,860
Like I -- and I think part of
that was, I am pretty sure that

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,480
growing up, we weren't eating, like,
fresh green beans, you know? They

80
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,310
were -- you know what I mean? They
were like canned or whatever.

79
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,000
Some sort of things --

81
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:51,305
Bekah: Did you eat green bean
casserole, though? I love green

82
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:52,055
bean casserole.

83
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,439
Dan: I probably avoided it
because I just didn't like green

84
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,079
beans [laughs]. You know what I mean?
Like, there's just- there's just

85
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,379
that thing. But, now, like,
especially like a -- like crispy --

86
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:02,000
like a -- not crispy, but-

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,300
Shelley McHardy: Fresh.

88
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,300
Dan: -crunchy? I don't know.
Whatever.

89
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:03,500
Shelley: Yeah.

87
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,300
Dan: But fresh green beans, you know? Like, not ov- like --

88
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,139
especially if they're not-

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,300
Bekah: Al dente green beans?

88
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,009
Dan: -overcooked thing. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. They

89
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,439
got a little crunch to 'em. And
-- I'm- I'm big fan these days.

90
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:17,574
Shelley: Hi, I'm Shelley. I am a
front-end developer in Atlanta,

91
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:22,283
Georgia. And I'm gonna have to go
with spinach. And again, just

92
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:25,134
like your canned green beans,
Dan, my mom used to do

93
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,500
disgusting things to spinach.
And it was not-

94
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:27,700
Dan: Yeah? [Laughs]

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Shelley: -not edible.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,300
Dan: Yeah.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,700
Shelley: Like, just- just awful.
She told a story, I don't

95
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,293
remember it

95
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:36,700
anymore, but she's -- she still
does vividly. That she -- the

96
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,194
dog would

96
00:05:37,194 --> 00:05:40,074
eat anything. And so she mixed
up a bunch of cooked spinach

97
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:42,300
with dog food and said, "If the
dog eats it, you guys have to

98
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,624
eat it."

98
00:05:42,624 --> 00:05:46,000
And we said, "Deal." The dog
picked around the cooked spinach

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,394
and- [Dan laughs] and just

99
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:50,574
ate all the kibble, and we never
had to eat cooked spinach again.

100
00:05:50,903 --> 00:05:52,074
Dan: Oh, that's hilarious.

101
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:54,473
Shelley: Which I love now. I
mean, like saag paneer and

102
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:56,394
stuff, if it's cooked well. Not
just smoosh.

103
00:05:56,994 --> 00:05:57,293
Dan: Right. Right.

104
00:05:57,744 --> 00:05:57,894
Shelley: So that's --

105
00:05:58,043 --> 00:05:59,093
Dan: Yeah. It's like the
spinach --

106
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,000
Bekah: Somebody at Virtual
Coffee -- sorry.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,300
Dan: Go ahead.

108
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:02,619
Bekah: Somebody at Virtual
Coffee — I think on Tuesday —

107
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:05,468
was talking about how they used
to eat canned spinach with a

108
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:07,478
little bit of salt on it. I was
like, "Ugh."

109
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:08,514
Shelley: Oh, no.

110
00:06:08,798 --> 00:06:11,079
Dan: Yeah, that's -- yeah. No,
no. That's the kind of thing

111
00:06:11,084 --> 00:06:13,500
that, like, the -- maybe
previous generation or whatever

112
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,000
was, you know, would eat.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,300
Shelley: Yeah.

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,149
Dan: Or like, I- I just
remember the Popeye, you know-

115
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:19,300
Bekah: Yeah.

113
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,700
Dan: -cartoon. And he -- there
was always a can. And it just

114
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,608
came out in like a mush, you
know? Like -- and he would just

115
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:26,769
like slurp it down. And that's-
that's what I think of when I

116
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:29,000
think of it. Yeah. That, like,
spinach- spinach-

117
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,199
Bekah: That's how I used to eat
it when I was a kid.

118
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,069
Dan: -from back in the day.
Yeah. Yeah.

119
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:32,348
Bekah: My grandma used to say.
She was like, "If you eat this

120
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:35,829
can, you'll be really strong."
And I was like, "Okay then."

121
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:36,848
Like, "I wanna be strong
[laughs]."

122
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:39,639
Shelley: And my brother and I
were like, "I don't care. I'll

123
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:40,009
be weak." [All laugh]

124
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:44,528
Bekah: It's what I should have
done. I was a little bit

125
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:48,939
gullible, I think [laughs].
Well, thanks for being here with

126
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:51,069
us today, Shelley. We're really
excited to have you on the

127
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:52,300
podcast. We start-

128
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:52,700
Shelley: Excited to be here.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,468
Bekah: -every episode of the
podcast [chuckles] -- all

128
00:06:57,468 --> 00:07:00,218
right. Like, my eyes started
watering. And now I'm like

129
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:03,000
crying. I'm not crying for any 
reason. It's just happening.

130
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:04,959
Shelley: [Chuckles] You're so
happy that I'm here.

131
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:08,000
Bekah: [Chuckles] That's it. I
was just so happy. It is an

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,293
involuntary physical

132
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:15,653
response to how happy I am to
hear your origin story. So

133
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:20,064
go ahead and- and kick us off
with how you got to this place

134
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:20,694
in your career.

135
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:23,300
Shelley: My orange -- origin
story. Now I have to decide if

136
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,223
I'm the hero or the villain,
okay?

137
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:26,723
Bekah: [Laughs] You can be both.

138
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:32,000
Shelley: Nah, I'm a good guy
[Bekah laughs]. Always. Let's

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,194
see. In my past life, I

139
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,024
was a high school chemistry
teacher. And even that was a ...

140
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:45,129
unplanned event. I actually
wanted to be Indiana Jones. A

141
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:47,108
hundred percent. I was an
anthropology made [??].

142
00:07:47,153 --> 00:07:47,843
Bekah: I love that.

143
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:51,879
Shelley: Yeah. I wasn't gonna --
the- the worst thing about

144
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,149
anthropology -- so I have to say
that I'm really grateful that I

145
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:59,468
discovered other paths because I
can't stand hot. And I can't

146
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:03,488
stand beating down sun. So, you
know. And every- every movie has

147
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:07,778
prepared you to dig up dinosaurs,
you know, in the desert heat. So

148
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,468
it's good that it didn't work
out. I took chemistry,

149
00:08:11,468 --> 00:08:15,639
accidentally, because I had
to take a lab science to

150
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:19,209
transfer to — the four year
university I wanted to go to. I

151
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:21,908
went -- I started at community
college. And so I'm like, "Okay,

152
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:25,538
I'm gonna take this bone head
chemistry class." And -- for

153
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:29,949
morons. I think it was called
that. And I completely loved it.

154
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:33,698
And I don't know why I missed
out in high school, but I did.

155
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:36,639
And then I took another one and
I realized that the teacher made

156
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,500
all the difference.

157
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:37,700
Bekah: Yes.

158
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,698
Shelley: And the environment of,
'You can make

157
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:43,778
mistakes. This is hard. That's
okay. You're not dumb.' And I

158
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:47,019
thrived and changed everything.
So I became that teacher and I

159
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:49,749
loved it. And I thought that I
would grow old teaching

160
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:54,489
chemistry, you know, and
doing fireballs in my lab as a

161
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:59,828
80 year old woman. But public
education is not all it's

162
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:03,249
cracked up to be. And I do
not wanna turn this into a

163
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:06,938
conversation about that, so we'll
just put that one aside. I

164
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:09,759
tried a lot of special programs,
a lot of special things. I did

165
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,229
some amazing stuff. I met
incredible kids. I loved it.

166
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:19,078
I missed it every day. But it --
I wasn't gonna grow old doing

167
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:23,558
it. So, at co- right at the
beginning of Covid, about six or

168
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:27,500
eight months in, I decided that
this -- or I should say, my

169
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,178
mental health

169
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:31,808
and physical health decided that
I wasn't gonna keep doing it. And

170
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:34,089
so I took a leave of absence and
thought, you know, "I'm just

171
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:37,700
gonna get better, I'm gonna take
a break, and then figure out

172
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,349
where to go

172
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:45,519
back." And for fun, because I'm
this kind of nerd, got an edX

173
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,200
course. I think, every --
"Python for everybody" or --

174
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,509
something-

174
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:52,629
something one of those little 10
hour courses. Not a- not a legit

175
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:57,300
anything. And it reminding back
my computer programming classes

176
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,683
in college.

176
00:09:57,683 --> 00:10:01,224
And I was like, "I used to love
this. Why have I, like, stepped

177
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:04,734
away?" I mean, did a lot of tech
stuff in- in the classroom, but

178
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:10,854
not programming. And I found
bootcamps. It completely changed

179
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:14,484
the search algorithms on all
social media. And that's all I

180
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:18,413
saw. And I hadn't even known what
they were. So I did some research

181
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:22,043
and I found one at Georgia Tech
that sounded amazing for my

182
00:10:22,043 --> 00:10:25,884
learning style. It was virtual,
which was required. There was no

183
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:28,943
way I was going into a classroom
at that point. This was early

184
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:36,114
2021. And I -- it was virtual,
it was live classes with an

185
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:41,844
instructor, and their whole thing
was that they broke out into

186
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:44,153
breakout rooms so you could
practice. So they teach for 10 or

187
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:46,913
15 minutes, and ask questions, and
then they send you in a group of

188
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:50,033
three or four people. And it was
just this cycle for three hours

189
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:54,293
at a time, you know, three times
a week. And it really worked for

190
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:58,764
me as far as the way I learn and
the way I work. Yeah, so I

191
00:10:58,764 --> 00:11:03,300
did that. Went to my first
virtual conference last summer,

192
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:03,668
heard about

192
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:10,808
Virtual Coffee, found you all,
new home, new family. Yeah,

193
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:13,298
took about a little over a year
to get my first job.

194
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:15,854
Bekah: What conference was that?
If you don't mind me asking.

195
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:17,019
Shelley: Refactr.tech.

196
00:11:17,714 --> 00:11:17,953
Bekah: Oh, cool.

197
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,548
Shelley: Yeah, so I don't know if
you know it. It's a little local

198
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:26,739
Atlanta one. Yeah. And it was
virtual that year cuz everything

199
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:29,859
was -- in fact I'm not going
this year cuz this year it's

200
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:34,058
completely back in person. I'm
kind of -- I think virtual

201
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:37,300
conferences were the best thing
that came outta Covid, and

202
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,500
there's still some hybrid ones.
But now people are going back a

203
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,700
hundred percent in person and
I'm just not wired for that

204
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,000
anymore. Or at least not yet.
Wait for this new vaccine to

205
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,953
show us how good it is
[chuckles].

206
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,548
Bekah: Yeah. Do you think that
if Covid hadn't hit, you would

207
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:54,068
still be teaching?

208
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:59,634
Shelley: Oh, that's a good
question. I would not still

209
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,384
be teaching in the same place
because I was definitely unhappy

210
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:08,229
there with the way things were
changing. I think I am still

211
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:12,038
teaching. That's the funny
thing. As soon as I got outta

212
00:12:12,038 --> 00:12:15,339
bootcamp, they reached out and
said, "Do you wanna be a TA?" So

213
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:20,528
I was a TA for my bootcamp, the
following cohort. I've start --

214
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:22,989
I've started volunteering for
Virtual Coffee, for Lunch and

215
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:23,200
Learn.

216
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,700
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

217
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,668
Shelley: I've become the
coordinator at Collab Lab for

216
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:29,000
the Career Lab, for little two
week-

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,500
Bekah: Yeah, awesome.

218
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,573
Shelley: -extension stuff
they do. So, I

217
00:12:32,573 --> 00:12:35,933
will always be a teacher. That's
just -- that's how I'm wired. I

218
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:40,134
think that's what I like about
software development and tech,

219
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,614
and how much -- not -- maybe not
everywhere, but at least the

220
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:46,464
places that I've gotten involved
with, how much teaching is just

221
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:50,604
sort of part of how it's done.
I doubt at this point I'd

222
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:54,474
still be in a classroom teaching
chemistry. Yeah. That's- that's-

223
00:12:55,553 --> 00:12:58,658
that's passed, I think,
unfortunately. Or maybe I'll go

224
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:00,999
back to it. Who knows? Or maybe
I'll go back and teach computer

225
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,438
science. That could be fun 
[chuckles].

226
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:07,568
Dan: I like that. Yeah. Or you
could -- yeah. Maybe you could

227
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:11,700
do ... well, I don't know what-
what you call it, but like, 

228
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,500
[chuckles] I'm sure there's

228
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,288
teaching positions that aren't,
you know, like, aren't the

229
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:15,500
whole full-time thing, right?
And-

230
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,000
Shelley: Yeah.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,889
Dan: -like, cuz -- just come in
and teach a class or something,

231
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:18,099
you know?

231
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:19,700
Shelley: Ooh. Or summer coding-

232
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,000
Dan: Well, yeah. There you go.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

233
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,500
Shelley: -programs for girls,
and stuff like that would --

232
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,999
that's definitely in my future,
without a doubt [chuckles].

233
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:28,700
Dan: Yeah, that'd be awesome. I would -- that -- I just really

234
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,700
loved how you said that. Cuz
the- the teaching- the

234
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,783
teaching aspect of- of this,
like,

235
00:13:32,783 --> 00:13:35,183
development -- and you're right.
Like, not everybody does it. Not

236
00:13:35,188 --> 00:13:39,024
everybody wants to do it a-and
that's perfectly fine. But it is

237
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:42,173
one of those things that when
you find the right, like, places

238
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:44,813
in the right communities, you
know, there -- that -- that's

239
00:13:44,813 --> 00:13:47,500
almost always one of the parts
of our -- of like, the

240
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,000
communities that feel good, at
least to me, right?

240
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,300
Shelley: Yeah.

241
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,000
Dan: Is- is people, like-

242
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,300
Shelley: Yeah.

241
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,700
Dan: -being willing to teach.
Even -- especially if it's not

242
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,474
like a- a position or

242
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:56,244
something, like an official
thing, right? But just people

243
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:59,153
sharing knowledge, you know?
It's- it's cool. It's --

244
00:13:59,153 --> 00:14:02,813
Shelley: Yeah. It's a -- it's an
amazing thing. That's my two- my

245
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:06,354
two big communities, Virtual
Coffee and Collab Lab. It's just

246
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:10,673
that. It's constantly sharing
information, asking questions,

247
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:16,539
you know, pairing up on all
sorts of things. It's amazing. I

248
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:19,869
don't think the rest of the world
is like that. I don't know.

249
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:19,700
I'm sure-

250
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,500
Dan: Yeah. It doesn't --

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,109
Shelley: -people answer
questions, but it's not- it's

250
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:24,058
not part of it. It's not
built-in.

251
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:27,188
Dan: Right. I- I- I mean, I think
I agree with you. I mean, I don't

252
00:14:27,188 --> 00:14:31,509
have any experience with other
careers. But like, the, you know,

253
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:34,178
my- my wife is -- she's had a
few different jobs over the last

254
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:38,500
however many years. And- and,
you know, she does data science

255
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:38,649
stuff

255
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:42,000
and it's- it's like programming
adjacent, you know, certainly.

256
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,308
Shelley: Mm-hmm.

256
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:45,500
Dan: And like, she did
[chuckles] -- her current job,

257
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,899
actually, is on GitHub now.
Like,

257
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:50,379
they are like sharing- sharing
... I don't know what it is.

258
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:53,700
But sequel schemes maybe or
something. I'm- I'm not sure 

259
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,500
[laughs] what they're doing,
you know? But- but it is that --

260
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,214
but it's still -- but there's

260
00:14:56,214 --> 00:15:00,533
not like that expectation
and that -- I don't know. It's

261
00:15:00,538 --> 00:15:02,964
still not the same, you know? It
isn't, like, just the way she

262
00:15:02,964 --> 00:15:05,453
talks about it and the way that,
like, they're all like, work, you

263
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:08,700
know? It's very different than a
lot- a lot of software

264
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,000
organizations that --

265
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,254
Shelley: Yeah.

264
00:15:09,254 --> 00:15:11,663
Dan: It's- it's a weird thing.
I- I think that a lot of other

265
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:14,703
industries or whatever could-
could learn a lot from- from

266
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:15,234
that.

266
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:18,264
Shelley: Definitely. There's
some overlap with teaching and

267
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:22,014
teachers. There was a new
trend. It was probably -- it's

268
00:15:22,014 --> 00:15:24,533
probably called something
different today, and 20 years

269
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:26,423
ago it was called something
different. But when I learned it,

270
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:30,519
it was called PLCs, Professional
Learning Communities. And it was

271
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,629
a set of protocols and mindsets
where you came together and

272
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:39,099
shared your work, shared your
blockers. I mean, it- it really

273
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:45,999
has a lot of overlaps with ...
the way that the tech space and

274
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:51,009
engineering talks about things
now. Retrospectives, you

275
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:54,158
know? All- all of those little
parts, there's a lot of overlap

276
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,678
with how teachers collaborated.

277
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:58,658
Dan: What was that called? What
was the --

278
00:15:58,778 --> 00:15:59,000
Shelley: PLC.

279
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,500
Dan: PLC.

280
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,928
Shelley: Professional Learning
Communities, I think? You know

279
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:02,889
it, Bekah. I don't know if you-

280
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:04,668
Bekah: I've definitely heard of
that before.

281
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,839
Shelley: -you've ever heard them
before.

281
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,058
Yeah. I'm sure they call it
something different now,

282
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:10,869
cuz that's kind of how the
education industry works is, you

283
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,599
know, put a new label on it every
10 years. I guess a lot of-

284
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,599
Bekah: [Laughs] Rebrand.

284
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,800
Shelley: -industries were like
that. Yeah. Rebrand it. Call it

285
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,119
something

285
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:18,969
new. It's everybody's favorite
thing. It was really funny when

286
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:21,668
I was first started teaching.
That's what veterans would tea-

287
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,000
tell me. Of like, "Yeah, we've
seen it all. There's nothing

288
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,300
new." And I was gung ho, and
like, "No, no. This is new. I

289
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,134
love this. This is brand new.

289
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:30,894
You've never seen anything like
it before." And then

290
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:33,173
I turned into that person of
like, "Yeah, yeah, we've seen it

291
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:37,700
all before [laughs]." But yeah,
that's the greatest thing about

292
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,000
my new job, is the first time --

292
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,700
that it started out as a
training thing where everybody

293
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,673
comes in and then they train for
-- not everybody, but this one

294
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,134
program I started called
Jumpstart. It was eight weeks of

295
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:52,000
training. And it just got you
used to a lot of different

296
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,599
things and

296
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:55,538
then you got assigned to a team.
So now you're thrown in, you're

297
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:59,349
the new one. And the first
time I paired with someone or

298
00:16:59,354 --> 00:17:02,229
shadowed someone, I was kind of
terrified. I was like, "They're

299
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:05,000
gonna think I know stuff and I
don't know anything [laughs]."

300
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,818
And it

300
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:11,499
was beautiful. He was talking
about what was going on. He

301
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:14,500
asked like, "Have you seen this
before? Are you familiar with

302
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:14,739
this?" I mean,

302
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:18,608
it was just -- and he's just a
developer. He's- he's not a

303
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:24,759
teacher. He wasn't taught how to
deliver new content, how to make

304
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:28,898
things feel risk-free, you know?
He doesn't have the pedagogy that

305
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:33,249
a teacher has. He was just a
natural and it was amazing. And

306
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:36,459
then I paired with somebody
else. And it was kind of the same

307
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:40,388
thing. Everybody I've worked with
on my team. I'm very lucky, has

308
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:46,500
sort of been that way. It's like
learning is part of their, like,

309
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,489
whole culture. And it's real.
It's not just, you know, we say

310
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:54,429
we do this and then you're left
on your own. So I've been lucky.

311
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:55,300
Bekah: I love that. I think
that's-

312
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,500
Shelley: Yeah.

313
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,800
Bekah: -so important to have
that culture,

312
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,759
that it -- that everybody
is on the same page rather than,

313
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:03,669
I think some places say like,
"We have a learning culture,"

314
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,700
and then they force people to-
to teach when they don't want

315
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,000
to. Or-

00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,348
Shelley: Mm-hmm [chuckles].

315
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,700
Bekah: -they're like, "In
addition to all of these other

316
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,794
tasks that totally

316
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:14,753
fill your day, you also have to
teach now. And we're not going

317
00:18:14,753 --> 00:18:18,384
to support you in knowing how to
really do that effectively." And

318
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:23,153
then you see so many negative
situations that come out of that,

319
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:27,923
you know, people feeling not
confident with their own skills,

320
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:31,493
thinking that, you know, I'm not
ready for this job or this

321
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:36,023
career, or whatever. But really
it's an issue with the culture

322
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:37,104
that's not supporting them.

323
00:18:37,104 --> 00:18:38,000
Shelley: Mm-hmm.

324
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,500
Bekah: I wanna backtrack --

325
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,378
Shelley: And it's not authentic.
Yeah. Go ahead.

324
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:45,713
Bekah: Yeah, sorry. I just
wanted to backtrack to Collab Lab

325
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:49,344
because you mentioned it and I
think they're doing great stuff.

326
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:52,104
And for our listeners who aren't
familiar with Collab Lab, can you

327
00:18:52,104 --> 00:18:56,634
just give kind of an overview of
what it is and what you did at

328
00:18:56,993 --> 00:19:00,203
-- where- where were you in your
journey from bootcamp to first

329
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:01,943
job working with Collab Lab?

330
00:19:02,163 --> 00:19:06,144
Shelley: Mm-hmm. Oh, I'd love to
tell the world about Collab Lab.

331
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:14,409
So it is ... it's an in between.
It's post-bootcamp, but it's not

332
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:18,219
really an apprenticeship or an
internship. The program was built

333
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:21,788
by Andrew and Stacy — and
probably a couple other people

334
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:26,499
I'm forgetting — a few years
ago. Because they realized that

335
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:30,000
bootcamps were the thing that's
-- this is -- they grew huge,

336
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,429
that's where a-

336
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:35,814
a lot of new engineers were
coming from. And we don't wanna

337
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:39,023
talk hours about bootcamps, but
they've got a lot of positives.

338
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:42,534
You learn a lot of stuff, you're
exposed to a lot of stuff, you

339
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:45,983
build some skills, but they don't
teach you how to work as an

340
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:48,233
engineer. And I guess you could
probably say that about

341
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:51,144
undergraduate programs too. You
don't learn how to work on a

342
00:19:51,144 --> 00:19:54,804
team, you don't, you know, learn
how to deal with that kind of

343
00:19:54,804 --> 00:20:00,713
stuff. So Collab Lab's goal is
to give you a more real-world

344
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:06,300
experience of getting a full
story of a project that you're

345
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,118
supposed to build, a team of
developers — so it's a group of

346
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:15,068
four developers, and the tickets
are all already done for you,

347
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:17,709
and the acceptance criteria. And
you kind of have to figure it

348
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:21,128
out. So it's not all perfect, at
least sanitized, like- like your

349
00:20:21,128 --> 00:20:24,038
homework assignments in
bootcamp. And you have a little

350
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:27,909
bit of freedom to, you know,
make mistakes and go your own

351
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:31,000
path. You're- you're not --
you're -- it's not dictated

352
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,300
exactly what techniques you're
supposed to use.

352
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,638
It's React, it's Firebase, the
rest is up to you.

353
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:38,828
Do whatever you want. Whatever
packages you think you're gonna

354
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:43,239
need, whatever path you're gonna
take. And you build ... it was a

355
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:47,288
shopping app. I think it still
is. And you have mentors

356
00:20:47,294 --> 00:20:50,949
assigned. So you get 3 mentors,
which is an amazing

357
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:56,199
ratio of, like, professional
support to newbies. So it's 4

358
00:20:56,199 --> 00:21:02,348
developers and 3 mentors. And
we did it in weeklong sprints.

359
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:05,769
So you decide your tickets, we
worked in pairs — it's all about

360
00:21:05,773 --> 00:21:10,298
pair programming. And so we
paired up, and we changed partners

361
00:21:10,298 --> 00:21:13,148
each week, and we went through our
ticket. And we're supposed to

362
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:18,624
spend about four or five hours a
week. And then, we'd have a

363
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:21,054
retro at the end of each week.
Oh, we also have an office hours.

364
00:21:21,054 --> 00:21:23,784
I forgot about office hours. So
you have a chance to- to meet

365
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,844
with the -- your mentor and just
talk about problems or whatever.

366
00:21:26,848 --> 00:21:30,804
And it's all communication over
Slack. I mean, the support is

367
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:33,173
unreal. I know I'm kind of like
just bouncing all over the place

368
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,804
instead of just presenting. But I
get filled with a lot of emotion

369
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:41,500
when I think about [laughs] this
program and I can't stay on

370
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:41,858
track. So

370
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:46,239
then at the end of the week, we
have the retro, you demo the

371
00:21:46,243 --> 00:21:53,138
little piece that you built.
And then, we also had some, I

372
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:56,108
think there were a couple little
workshop-y type things on stuff.

373
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,259
Like, we had one workshop on
accessibility cuz that's not

374
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:04,358
covered well in bootcamp.
They basically try and fill all

375
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:07,598
these little holes. And to give
you some real experience and

376
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:11,243
confidence. And so that's an
8-week program, and they do

377
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:16,223
four cohorts a year. And then at
the end of the eight weeks,

378
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:19,074
you've got a project, you've got
an amazing project to put on

379
00:22:19,074 --> 00:22:24,054
your portfolio that's not
like everybody else's, you know,

380
00:22:24,173 --> 00:22:28,673
Pomodoro timer and sho- I was
gonna say shopping list. To-do list.

381
00:22:28,703 --> 00:22:33,203
That's it. The infamous to-do
list that everybody's built.

382
00:22:33,263 --> 00:22:36,354
So you have a, you know, more
unique fun project and a lot more

383
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:40,300
to talk about. And then the last
two weeks, if you're interested,

384
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:40,719
is Career Lab.

384
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:43,838
And that's the part that I've
gotten involved with. Because

385
00:22:43,838 --> 00:22:47,648
that changed everything for me.
You spend a week doing

386
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:50,378
similar type things. You have
some tasks, you meet with a

387
00:22:50,378 --> 00:22:54,909
couple of men -- volunteer mentors
to update your LinkedIn is

388
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:59,048
the first week. And the second
week is interviewing, which

389
00:22:59,048 --> 00:23:03,999
nothing they do in bootcamp
prepares you for interviewing.

390
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:07,989
So, you get to watch mock
interviews. You get a bunch of

391
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:11,199
practice interview questions.
They pair you up with another

392
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:14,769
collabie — that's what we're
called — so that you can sort

393
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:18,189
of practice your answers. And
then you do two practice

394
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:21,729
interviews — a behavioral and a
tech interview. There's even a

395
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:25,239
tech project that you build and
then go into the interview to

396
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:30,398
present what you did. So it's
much more realistic. And tech

397
00:23:31,854 --> 00:23:36,233
interviews were- were my- my
killer thing. I had several of

398
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:40,374
them before, and after, and during
Collab Lab. And that's where I

399
00:23:40,374 --> 00:23:47,483
tanked. My brain would shut
down. I could- could not -- I

400
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:50,723
couldn't code anymore. It's like
I knew nothing. Like, and- and it

401
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:54,500
was just awful experience. And
so I kept doing it because

402
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,673
everyone told me that's

402
00:23:55,673 --> 00:23:58,763
what it was gonna be like. And
I kept pushing through.

403
00:23:58,794 --> 00:24:01,644
But I never got better at them.
There were a couple of good ones

404
00:24:01,644 --> 00:24:05,423
because the interviewers treated
it like pair programming. But

405
00:24:05,423 --> 00:24:10,374
mostly, it was some dude sitting
back in dead silence watching me

406
00:24:10,374 --> 00:24:16,433
burn [laughs]. And I just don't
respond well to that. So when we

407
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:23,288
went through Career Lab, they
kind of showed us how to tell our

408
00:24:23,288 --> 00:24:27,909
story, how to lead the interview a
little bit, to say the things we

409
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:31,989
wanted to say, where to take
chances, you know, stuff like

410
00:24:31,993 --> 00:24:38,169
that. And I had an interview
about three or four weeks after, I

411
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:43,239
think, the Career Lab with my
current employer. And I just --

412
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:46,179
I channeled the whole thing. I'm
just like, "I'm going to do this,

413
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:52,828
this way." And it was phenomenal.
It was like magic. I- I- I

414
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:57,759
felt great. I did fantastic.
Every question he asked, I

415
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:02,048
understood and could answer. I
felt- I felt really, really good.

416
00:25:02,108 --> 00:25:04,209
And I had a couple other good
interviews too. So I ended up

417
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:05,000
getting two offers.

418
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,300
Bekah: Yeay!

419
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,048
Shelley: Yeah. And so I got to
choose. That was the

418
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:11,858
craziest thing after a year of,
you know, fingernail biting, I

419
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:15,519
got two offers in a week and got
to pick the one that I liked

420
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:15,638
the best.

421
00:25:16,358 --> 00:25:18,759
Bekah: That's really awesome and
we were chatting a little bit

422
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:23,798
before we started recording
about the difference between

423
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,239
interviewing and preparing for a
job in tech versus other careers

424
00:25:28,689 --> 00:25:31,628
and how it is so different. Can
you talk a little bit more about

425
00:25:31,628 --> 00:25:31,929
that?

426
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:36,459
Shelley: Sure. The biggest
difference is how many rounds of

427
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:40,388
interviews, I think. Because I've
had a lot of teaching interviews.

428
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:45,038
Before I was a teacher, I had all
kinds of weird jobs all over the

429
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:50,348
place in different industries.
And it was typically one

430
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:57,068
interview, possibly a second.
But I feel like I've been -- every

431
00:25:57,068 --> 00:26:00,338
job I've gotten, I think was one
interview, you know? They- they

432
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:03,000
saw your resume, they chatted
with you on the phone for a few 

433
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
minutes, you sat fast to --

433
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,513
face to face for half an hour,
an hour. And maybe

434
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:10,614
you didn't get the offer right
then, you know? Maybe they slept

435
00:26:10,614 --> 00:26:15,534
on it? But you didn't get called
in again, and again, and again.

436
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:20,784
You don't have to perform ... hm.
Perform. That's the right word.

437
00:26:20,784 --> 00:26:21,500
Bekah: That's the right word.
Yeah.

437
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,700
Shelley: You don't have to
perform live. And it's funny

438
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,300
cuz I'm a teacher. I'm used to
performing live. That's what I

439
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,000
do. But in something I'm an
expert in-

440
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,300
Bekah: Yep.

440
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,903
Shelley: -you know? Give me-
give me an interview for a

440
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:35,844
teaching job today. I'm gonna --
I haven't done it in two years,

441
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,423
but I guarantee I'll knock
everyone else out of the water.

442
00:26:38,903 --> 00:26:45,864
But I'm a newbie. I'm a beginner.
I'm a novice. I love it. I love

443
00:26:45,864 --> 00:26:50,963
it when something works. I think
JavaScript is loads of fun.

444
00:26:51,413 --> 00:26:55,854
But I don't know it like that.
So you ask me something live and

445
00:26:55,854 --> 00:27:01,300
I choke. So, so many rounds of
that is- is traumatizing. I

446
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,000
don't know any other word for
it. Like, the first couple

447
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
rounds are fine, and the
behavioral interviews, I always

448
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,500
did fine.

449
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:08,700
Bekah: Yeah.

00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,044
Shelley: But as soon as it

448
00:27:10,044 --> 00:27:12,773
started getting technical, it's
like, "I don't know this well

449
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:15,000
enough to be tested." And it's
a test.

450
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,300
Bekah: Yeah.

451
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,183
Shelley: Really a test.

450
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:20,409
Bekah: That's a good point. I
think there was one role I

451
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:24,000
interviewed for where I went
through six interviews

452
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,638
[chuckles]. And then

452
00:27:24,638 --> 00:27:29,558
didn't get the job. I was like,
"Oh, wow. That- that was really,

453
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:34,959
really intense." But- but
you're right. I've never had

454
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:39,759
that anywhere else. I think,
tops, I've had three interviews

455
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:43,419
for something and the last was
probably more of a compensation

456
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:44,300
interview. You know-

457
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:44,500
Shelley: Mm-hmm.

458
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,078
Bekah: -talking through that
kind of stuff. But

457
00:27:47,378 --> 00:27:50,769
the process is -- and it seems
pretty standard that you just

458
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,368
continually go through these
rounds and it does get really

459
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:58,388
intense and stressful. And I
remember somebody on Twitter,

460
00:27:58,388 --> 00:28:02,753
early in my career, calling it
soul crushing. And I thought,

461
00:28:02,753 --> 00:28:04,000
"Well, it can't be that bad."

467
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Shelley: Yeah, it's pretty
intense. Yeah [laughs].

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,700
Bekah: And- and then what I had
to -- I'm like, "Oh, yeah. Yeah,

462
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,183
it is. It is that bad." Like
[laughs] ... it's really

463
00:28:11,183 --> 00:28:12,000
exhausting.

464
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,500
Shelley: Yeah.

465
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,284
Bekah: And it's -- especially,
I, you know, mentioning that you

464
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:18,473
had different kinds of
interviews. Like, where some

465
00:28:18,473 --> 00:28:22,500
people would just sit back and,
like, stare at you. And-

466
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,000
Shelley: Mm-hmm.

466
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,700
Bekah: -you know, how -- I don't
know how they expect people to

467
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,034
perform in that

467
00:28:29,034 --> 00:28:33,503
situation when you're already
nervous. I think that you should

468
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:37,314
be doing your best to support the
person on the other side of the

469
00:28:37,314 --> 00:28:41,483
screen so you can see how they
perform at their best, you know?

470
00:28:41,483 --> 00:28:45,203
Because you're- you're not going
to be in that situation most

471
00:28:45,203 --> 00:28:49,500
days where it's awful and
somebody is really putting the

472
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,064
pressure on you.

472
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:54,953
Shelley: Someone described it to
me as hazing, and that clicked.

473
00:28:55,344 --> 00:28:59,243
So, and- and there are -- it- it
-- I had both experiences. There

474
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:03,384
were definitely people who were
interviewing so that I could show

475
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:07,433
my best. Definitely. And then
we would just reach a point where

476
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:11,453
I'd, you know, maxed out my
knowledge and me, personally,

477
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,700
didn't handle that well.

478
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,000
Bekah: Mm.

479
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,354
Shelley: And some people told me
that that's

478
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:19,913
part of it too. Like, how do you
respond when you don't know what

479
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:23,753
to do? And even then, it's so
artificial because it's like, if

480
00:29:23,753 --> 00:29:26,273
I don't know what to do, I'm
gonna send you a message, call

481
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:29,574
you, whatever, and go, "Hey, I
can't figure this out." But you

482
00:29:29,693 --> 00:29:32,394
don't feel comfortable doing
that with a complete stranger

483
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:33,500
when a job is on the line.

484
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

485
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,648
Shelley: So, yeah. I definitely
have likened it to PTSD and all

484
00:29:39,098 --> 00:29:44,138
[chuckles] sorts of traumatic
stuff. When I finally signed the

485
00:29:44,144 --> 00:29:47,700
contract, and it was official
and done, and I wasn't gonna

486
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,219
start for

486
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:51,219
about five weeks, that's another
thing. That's really different

487
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:54,159
in tech too, that you might not
start for weeks and weeks because

488
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:58,148
they just have their onboarding
schedule or whatever. I

489
00:29:58,148 --> 00:30:02,993
collapsed. I just stopped doing
anything. And I gave myself

490
00:30:02,993 --> 00:30:08,574
permission to. I was like, "This
was the craziest ride ever."

491
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,993
And it's funny. Everyone's like,
"Oh, it's a full-time job to get

492
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:17,604
a job." It's maybe not full-time.
But the stress and the psychic

493
00:30:17,604 --> 00:30:22,403
energy involved is
exhausting as working 40 or 60

494
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:25,973
hours a week. There's no- no
doubt about it. And there's a

495
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:29,700
lot of when it rains, it pores.
I had one week where I was

496
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,000
juggling ... I think five or six
applications all in different

497
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,679
places. Like, one

497
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,548
was make the perfect, you know,
cover letter all the way to this

498
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:42,459
is the final tech interview and
you're gonna present something

499
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:45,939
that you've built over the
course of a week. Like, just --

500
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:48,800
it was nuts. So yeah, that is
kind of like a full time job 

501
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,088
[laughs].

501
00:30:50,894 --> 00:30:55,044
Bekah: Well, I always try and
encourage people to take time off

502
00:30:55,074 --> 00:30:58,000
in between jobs and starting
their new job.

503
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,300
Shelley: Mm-hmm.

504
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,700
Bekah: And a lot of it's for
that reason.

503
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,000
Because it's- it's important to
get kind of healthy

504
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,804
habits set up, especially if
you're working from home.

505
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:13,463
Finding that space to be able to
navigate in between your job and

506
00:31:13,554 --> 00:31:17,273
your home life can be really
challenging. But because that

507
00:31:17,273 --> 00:31:22,463
interviewing stress can be so
intense, it -- it's good to

508
00:31:22,469 --> 00:31:25,913
breathe before you jump right
in. And it sounds like you had a

509
00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:29,500
pretty good onboarding
experience with your 8-week --

510
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,000
I ca-

511
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,300
Shelley: Yeah.

512
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,473
Bekah: -Jumpstart?

510
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:31,663
Shelley: Jumpstart. Yep.

511
00:31:31,663 --> 00:31:35,094
Bekah: That sounds really great,
rather than- than just being

512
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:39,000
thrown into, "All right. Here's
some work. Now do it!" [Laughs]

514
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,500
You know? Where it can be-

513
00:31:39,624 --> 00:31:40,183
Shelley: Mm-hmm. Figure it out.

514
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:43,749
Bekah: -equally stressful because
you don't know how to communicate

515
00:31:43,749 --> 00:31:47,378
or what the process for things
is. And it sounds like Jumpstart

516
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:51,368
helped to establish good paths
of communication.

517
00:31:52,314 --> 00:31:55,163
Shelley: Yeah, it's a- it's an
amazing program. And it is a

518
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,733
program. It's something that
Rightpoint — that's my company —

519
00:31:59,124 --> 00:32:03,324
developed like three or four
years ago. So they've had, you

520
00:32:03,324 --> 00:32:07,973
know, about eight cohorts at this
point. And they've found that

521
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:13,838
it's just a really good way to
bring in new engineers, you know,

522
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:17,739
junior level that don't know
anything. So we're all either

523
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:20,679
bootcamp grads, or recent grads,
or were a couple of computer

524
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:24,878
science grads too. Most of us
had jobs in other industries. So

525
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:29,979
that part of the skill set we
had. We just hadn't worked,

526
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:33,700
you know, on an engineering
team, and, you know, Agile

527
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,614
development, and all of

527
00:32:34,614 --> 00:32:38,784
that, and sprints. So we got to
learn that, and shadow people

528
00:32:38,784 --> 00:32:45,683
all over the company, and work
through training stuff. And also

529
00:32:45,683 --> 00:32:48,953
had assignments and, you know,
we were cohort. It was a really

530
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:54,713
great way to do it. And so it
felt kind of like school, but on

531
00:32:54,713 --> 00:32:58,513
the job. And then when we got
put on a team, we're still

532
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:03,669
consider, you know, novices.
So I've been doing new training

533
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:07,538
cuz you know, there's things that
my team uses that other teams

534
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:12,489
don't use. I've been learning
about Optimizely and will

535
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:16,628
probably be the- the person on
the team that knows the most in

536
00:33:16,634 --> 00:33:20,078
a couple of months because I got
that- that task of learn

537
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:25,298
Optimizely so that we can start
using it on our project.

538
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:31,509
So that's been fun and ... it's
just- just been great. Actually

539
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,200
you've caught me the really,
really good week. I have to brag

540
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,700
for a minute.

541
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,300
Bekah: Do it!

540
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,009
Shelley: I haven't sh- I
haven't shared this in tech

541
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:46,449
spaces yet. Today's Thursday. So
on Tuesday, I put in my first

542
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:49,700
PR as a professional engineer.

543
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,300
Bekah: Yeay!

544
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,700
Shelley: And it has, it's only
gotten-

545
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,300
Dan: Nice.

543
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,800
Shelley: -reviewed and approved
once. It's not merged yet, so

544
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,358
that's what I'm

544
00:33:55,358 --> 00:33:57,729
waiting, for the merge, before I
make the official announcement.

545
00:33:57,729 --> 00:34:01,929
But I am so excited because it
was something that I wrote all

546
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:05,500
by myself. They wanted -- and it
-- they've -- that's- that's

547
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,800
part of it too. This is part of
the learning thing. They don't

548
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,419
just throw you

548
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:11,619
at the codebase and say, "Figure
it out." The first task I was

549
00:34:11,623 --> 00:34:15,728
given was there's something that
they do manually, every time,

550
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:19,628
that's tedious copying and
pasting of translations. Cuz

551
00:34:19,628 --> 00:34:23,568
we're a global company, so every
time we launch a site, it's the

552
00:34:23,568 --> 00:34:27,829
same site for a different country
or language. Everything has

553
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:30,798
to be translated. Every single
button, every single everything,

554
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:34,759
description has to have a new
translation. And we're not gonna

555
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:39,528
build a whole new site for it.
So they just do this manually.

556
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:45,300
They send a CSV to a translation
team, they get the 800

557
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:45,708
translations,

557
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,798
and then somebody copies and
paste them into a file. And so

558
00:34:48,798 --> 00:34:52,000
they're like, "We need to
automate this. Shelley, do it."

559
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,673
[Laughs] I'm just

559
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,974
like, "Are you kidding? I don't
know the codebase. I don't know

560
00:34:55,974 --> 00:35:01,614
anything. You want me to do
this? Okay, cool." So I built a

561
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:06,414
CLI. And I'm so proud of it, and
it works, and I might be demoing

562
00:35:06,414 --> 00:35:09,700
it this morning. Yeah. So. And-
and it was not that big a deal.

00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,000 
Dan: Awesome.

563
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,700
Shelley: Anyone else would look
at it would be like, "Oh, that's

564
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,813
cute." [Laughs]

564
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,914
Bekah: No, that's a big deal.

565
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:14,873
Shelley: Yeah, it's mine
[laughs].

566
00:35:17,318 --> 00:35:19,000
Bekah: And then, uh, have a big
impact, I think, on the

567
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,500
processes there and making
people's lives easier. So-

568
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:22,700
Shelley: Mm-hmm.

568
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,300
Bekah: -I think that's really,
really-

569
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:24,500
Shelley: Yeah.

570
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,059
Bekah: -important.

569
00:35:25,509 --> 00:35:28,478
Shelley: Yeah. Other people will
use it, maybe, once a month for

570
00:35:28,478 --> 00:35:33,128
the next six months, and then
it'll go away. But that's okay

571
00:35:33,128 --> 00:35:33,599
[chuckles].

571
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,204
Bekah: Yeah. So, okay. So
you've been through this whole

572
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:43,884
process. And I think that you've
shared a lot of really great

573
00:35:43,884 --> 00:35:49,103
information and I appreciate you
sharing your story. So what

574
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:55,074
advice would you give to somebody
who is maybe towards the end of

575
00:35:55,074 --> 00:35:59,034
their bootcamp and thinking about
what the next step should be.

576
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,700
Shelley: It's- it's -- I think
it's really an individual thing.

577
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:03,967
So I

577
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:09,367
think the best advice I could
give is asking yourself what

578
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:13,327
exactly you want and what's
important to you. Because

579
00:36:13,327 --> 00:36:15,878
where you're at in life's gonna
make a difference. I've had this

580
00:36:15,878 --> 00:36:19,507
conversation actually with
someone at The Collab Lab of,

581
00:36:19,628 --> 00:36:24,233
you know, what next? If you are
young and you don't have kids or

582
00:36:24,233 --> 00:36:28,193
responsibilities, you know,
you're in a very different place

583
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:31,853
in your career no matter what
field you're in. But definitely

584
00:36:31,853 --> 00:36:35,063
in tech, you know, you could
sign up with one of those two

585
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:38,362
year contract programs where
they train you, and hire you

586
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,000
out, and you make crap money,
but get great experience.

587
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,300
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

588
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,753
Shelley: But you have to live

587
00:36:41,753 --> 00:36:45,353
someplace weird or you don't
get a good enough salary. And

588
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:49,000
you're stuck for two years. I'm
not at that place in my life. I

589
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,327
got a

589
00:36:49,327 --> 00:36:52,700
little paranoid towards the end
of- [chuckles] of this journey.

590
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,768
It took seven

590
00:36:53,768 --> 00:36:57,338
months after bootcamp to get my
job. So somewhere around the

591
00:36:57,338 --> 00:37:01,538
five or six month mark was like,
"Maybe I am gonna sign up.

592
00:37:01,688 --> 00:37:05,438
Maybe- maybe that is what I'm
gonna do." But something in me

593
00:37:05,438 --> 00:37:10,500
all along said, "You need to
find the place that fits you.

594
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:16,500
And being assigned a contract
for a client wasn't gonna

595
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,617
achieve that." Even if

595
00:37:17,617 --> 00:37:19,507
I didn't care about the money,
even if I didn't care about the

596
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:23,257
flexibility, I wasn't gonna get
to pick where I went. And I

597
00:37:23,257 --> 00:37:26,527
realized that was critically
important. And honestly, the- the

598
00:37:26,532 --> 00:37:29,737
interview process taught me that
too. I met some amazing people

599
00:37:29,737 --> 00:37:33,668
and I met some horrible people.
Like, "Okay, yeah, you made me

600
00:37:33,728 --> 00:37:36,338
cry and I don't wanna work for
you," you know? Like, thank you

601
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:39,097
for that. You took a half an
hour after the crying to go,

602
00:37:39,097 --> 00:37:44,288
"Okay, wait. Thanks for that. I
don't wanna work for you." So,

603
00:37:44,288 --> 00:37:48,700
for me -- so, if a person is
like me, interviewing the

604
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,717
company, finding

604
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:54,577
that spot, really doing your
research of who they say they

605
00:37:54,577 --> 00:37:58,208
are, and then, once you get into
the interview process, if

606
00:37:58,213 --> 00:38:00,967
they're gonna force you to do
five interviews, force them to

607
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:01,700
do five interviews.

608
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,000
Bekah: Hm.

609
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,887
Shelley: Ask them the questions.
Really dig into who

608
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:10,358
they are and what they're about.
Because for me, that was what

609
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:13,088
was I decided was most important.
I needed to find a place where

610
00:38:13,092 --> 00:38:18,862
the people ... felt right, you
know? The product would be nice

611
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:22,163
too, you know? I ended up in
e-commerce. That's not a thing I

612
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:26,000
ever would've predicted
[chuckles] at all. I'm all about 

613
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,693
education, and

613
00:38:26,693 --> 00:38:30,112
nonprofit, and, you know,
whatever. And I love these

614
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:34,222
people. I mean, they're- they're
amazing. And they're -- it's --

615
00:38:34,222 --> 00:38:37,672
it just so happens that commerce
is their thing. So now commerce

616
00:38:37,677 --> 00:38:44,168
is my thing until the next thing
comes around. But ... also

617
00:38:44,557 --> 00:38:47,288
f-finding people, I guess that's
it too. This is could be really

618
00:38:47,288 --> 00:38:51,577
isolating. It's amazing that we
can do this all virtually.

619
00:38:51,637 --> 00:38:56,677
But that also means that you're
all by yourself. So you have to

620
00:38:56,677 --> 00:38:59,887
find communities, you have to
find other people that are in

621
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:03,007
the same boat as you. That's why
Collab Lab was so good. Cuz

622
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,773
it's filled with people that are
looking for their first role, or

623
00:39:06,773 --> 00:39:09,893
just found their first role, or
are there to support people

624
00:39:10,103 --> 00:39:15,083
finding their first role. Like,
that's the entire focus. And

625
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:21,983
in a really loving, supportive,
fun way. Not a, you know,

626
00:39:22,342 --> 00:39:25,643
commercial way, the way the- the
career services in bootcamp are,

627
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:28,643
where they're just, "We're gonna
get you a job, so apply to 800

628
00:39:28,643 --> 00:39:34,000
things." But honestly, that
works for some people too, you

629
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
know? The- the numbers

629
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,793
game of applying to every single
thing and hoping something

630
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:43,552
sticks. I got turned off of
that really, really quick. So I

631
00:39:43,552 --> 00:39:47,000
just got really picky and
choosy. I had my schedule. I

632
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,083
gotta find one

632
00:39:48,088 --> 00:39:52,762
or two things, three things a
week that really mean something

633
00:39:52,762 --> 00:39:56,753
and apply to them. Oh, and
cover letters. Cover letters,

634
00:39:56,782 --> 00:39:58,793
cover letters, cover letters. I
don't care what anyone says,

635
00:39:58,793 --> 00:39:59,612
they make a difference.

636
00:39:59,612 --> 00:40:00,182
Bekah: I love cover letters.

637
00:40:00,393 --> 00:40:02,693
Shelley: And if they don't make
a difference, then you don't

638
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:03,273
need to work there [chuckles].

639
00:40:05,088 --> 00:40:08,000
Dan: [Chuckles] That- that adv-
that advice about getting picky

640
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
about things, you know, you're
not the first person on the

641
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,700
podcast to have that

641
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,047
advice. A-and I think it's --
it- it makes a lot of sense to

642
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:18,000
me, you know? I -- you can get
the -- like numbers game

643
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,300
approach, you know, can make
some sort of logic sense, you

644
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,208
know? I mean, like, I- I can

644
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:25,927
understand the logic behind it.
But the -- everyone that we've

645
00:40:25,932 --> 00:40:29,467
talked to that has gone through
like a- a long and especially,

646
00:40:29,472 --> 00:40:32,963
like, a hard journey like that,
I think comes out on the

647
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,333
other side. Like, they finally
-- like, some people, like, were

648
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:38,092
thro- throwing out thousands of
interviews and then eventually

649
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,523
started getting picky, you know?
And- and some people started that

650
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:43,432
way to start. But it seems like
the people that are happy with

651
00:40:43,432 --> 00:40:46,500
their roles, you know, it --
after the awful journey of the

652
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,500
interview process, you know?

653
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:47,700
Shelley: Mm-hmm.

652
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,983
Dan: The people that have found,
like, the people --

653
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,132
that -- the companies that they
liked, have all been -- they've

654
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:55,463
all said this similar things of,
you know, find- find companies

655
00:40:57,202 --> 00:40:59,302
that, like, either the people or
the- the product or whatever are

656
00:40:59,302 --> 00:41:01,000
meaningful and do the research
and all that stuff.

657
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,300
Shelley: Mm-hmm.

657
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,000
Dan: And- and, yeah. Yeah,
narrow your scope.

658
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,300
Shelley: Yeah.

658
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,500
Dan: I think that's great. I
mean, I think that's a great

659
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,000
advice.

659
00:41:06,503 --> 00:41:09,773
Shelley: I mean, it's- it's
tough. It's big risk because,

660
00:41:09,773 --> 00:41:12,800
you know, it's really expensive
to be unemployed. And if, god

661
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,268
forbid,

661
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:16,538
you're actually working a job
while trying to find a job, I- I

662
00:41:16,538 --> 00:41:20,257
couldn't even imagine that. I
was very, very, very lucky that,

663
00:41:20,257 --> 00:41:24,248
you know, my wife had health
insurance, and I had savings, so

664
00:41:24,253 --> 00:41:28,447
I could work a part-time TA job
and do just fine for seven

665
00:41:28,478 --> 00:41:33,157
months. And I know not everyone
can do that. And it might take

666
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:38,858
more than seven months. I think I
also got really lucky. But

667
00:41:38,858 --> 00:41:41,467
yeah, I'm really- I'm really,
really glad that I was picky,

668
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,737
that I kept telling myself
that's- that's what I needed to

669
00:41:44,737 --> 00:41:466,700
do. And there was always a
little voice going, "You're

670
00:41:466,700 --> 00:41:47,347
being stupid.

670
00:41:47,347 --> 00:41:50,498
Just get a job," you know? "This
is- this is- this is not real.

671
00:41:50,768 --> 00:41:54,307
You're not gonna be able to
find the right job this way."

672
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:57,500
And then it works. So, [laughs]
not very scientific, but I'm

673
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,688
gonna say, "Yes, do it that
way."

674
00:41:59,422 --> 00:41:59,753
Dan: Yeah.

675
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:03,262
Bekah: I think, you know, that-
that point that you made about

676
00:42:03,262 --> 00:42:06,862
having support behind you is
really important. Especially

677
00:42:06,862 --> 00:42:11,182
to new folks who are coming into
tech. Because I think that

678
00:42:11,182 --> 00:42:14,000
there's often these promises
that tech is this goldmine, and

679
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,663
you're gonna

679
00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:19,112
find a great job, and a great
career, and- and it will, you

680
00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:21,813
know, help you with your life
situation. So, we see so many

681
00:42:21,813 --> 00:42:25,000
career changers and then,
they're doing this thing where

682
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,500
they do have seven months and
they can't find a job. And so-

683
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:28,700
Shelley: Mm-hmm.

683
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,300
Bekah: -they're -- I think it's
really important that we talk

684
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,813
openly about, like, it's

684
00:42:33,813 --> 00:42:38,103
hard, first of all. You're
going to have to go through this

685
00:42:38,103 --> 00:42:40,952
really rigorous interview
process, and then after that,

686
00:42:40,952 --> 00:42:44,972
you might not get a job. So you
need to plan on taking, I would

687
00:42:44,978 --> 00:42:45,700
say at least six months-

688
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,000
Shelley: Mm-hmm.

689
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,938
Bekah: -to look for a job. And
then, also, I think that it can

688
00:42:51,938 --> 00:42:56,197
really impact relationships with
the people who are close to you,

689
00:42:56,288 --> 00:42:57,000
you know? Because-

690
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,300
Shelley: Mm-hmm.

691
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,827
Bekah: -they're supporting you
as you're going

690
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,947
through this situation. And I've
seen relationships break up

691
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:06,367
because the partner says, "Oh,
yeah. I am totally supportive

692
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:10,447
and I am here for you." But
without really understanding how

693
00:43:10,447 --> 00:43:14,197
stressful this situation can be.
And, "Hey, I'm really sorry, but

694
00:43:14,197 --> 00:43:17,688
I'm gonna have to put in four
more hours tonight because I've

695
00:43:17,688 --> 00:43:19,000
gotta get this take home test
done-

696
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,300
Shelley: Mm-hmm.

697
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,097
Bekah: -so I can go to this job interview." And

696
00:43:22,097 --> 00:43:27,378
I know, you know, my husband,
Jesse, was a career transitioner

697
00:43:27,378 --> 00:43:31,788
before I was into tech. And at
the time, I didn't understand

698
00:43:31,788 --> 00:43:34,637
it, you know? He was like going
to work, and then coming home,

699
00:43:34,668 --> 00:43:36,700
and like, "Oh, I've gotta do
FreeCodeCamp and all this

700
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,302
stuff." An I'm like, "Dude,

700
00:43:38,302 --> 00:43:40,000
I've been with the kids all
day." Like [laughs] --

701
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Shelley: Yeah [laughs].

702
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,700
Bekah: And then, once I came
into tech, it- it all made

701
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,932
a lot more sense. Like, "Uh-oh.
Now I understand this."

702
00:43:47,932 --> 00:43:52,193
But I wasn't prepared for that
in terms of like being a

703
00:43:52,197 --> 00:43:55,612
supportive partner and knowing
where that would get us as a

704
00:43:55,612 --> 00:43:58,500
family. And I'm like, "This is a
long-term investment, but it's-

705
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,152
it's gonna be hard."

706
00:43:59,978 --> 00:44:02,887
Shelley: Yeah. My wife said
something. It was a couple weeks

707
00:44:02,887 --> 00:44:08,438
after I got the job, before I
started. And, you know, one of

708
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:11,300
those heartfelt moments, and she
was like, "You're incredibly

709
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,000
strong." And I'm like, "What are
you talking about?" [Laughs]

710
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,733
I was like, "I cry so much," you

710
00:44:16,733 --> 00:44:21,202
know, or whatever. And she's
like, "The last seven months,

711
00:44:21,202 --> 00:44:24,700
you worked so hard, and it was
so uncomfortable, and so

712
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,643
painful, and

712
00:44:25,882 --> 00:44:29,302
so traumatic, and so emotional,
and- and just, you know, all of

713
00:44:29,302 --> 00:44:32,918
these things." And she goes,
"Besides the fact you shocked

714
00:44:32,918 --> 00:44:37,568
everything and learned this new
thing. Like, you put it all out

715
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:41,000
there." And I was like, "Oh,
gosh, you're right [laughs].

716
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,757
I guess I am."

716
00:44:43,117 --> 00:44:48,248
Yeah, I don't think anyone can
get just how hard it is. And

717
00:44:48,248 --> 00:44:52,237
I'm sure lots of career
transitions are tough. But

718
00:44:52,237 --> 00:44:55,838
yeah, this- this particular one
comes with a huge amount of hype

719
00:44:56,168 --> 00:45:02,543
and fanfare. And the slog is not
something, you know, you're

720
00:45:02,543 --> 00:45:05,500
necessarily prepared for. Oh,
and the rejection. Holly

721
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,800
goodness. I've never been
rejected for so many things

722
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:07,943
[laughs].

722
00:45:09,027 --> 00:45:10,148
Bekah: It's worse than high
school. Like [laughs] --

723
00:45:10,943 --> 00:45:14,300
Shelley: Yeah. Like [laughs], I
mean, I- I get it. I get it.

724
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,112
Totally, you

724
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,512
know? You're gonna, "I'm not the
perfect fit. I don't have a

725
00:45:17,518 --> 00:45:19,972
problem with that." But there's
something about that third or

726
00:45:19,978 --> 00:45:22,500
fourth interview, and you're
like, "Oh, I've gotta have it

727
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,052
now." No. That's- that's still
the beginning of the process

728
00:45:27,112 --> 00:45:28,700
[laughs]. Because there were a
lot of times where I made to the

729
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:32,182
third or fourth step and then,
didn't go further. So --

730
00:45:33,402 --> 00:45:33,500
Bekah: Yeah.

731
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:33,402
Shelley: Oh, it's the worst
thing.

732
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,943
Bekah: I was invited to apply
for two positions a while

731
00:45:36,947 --> 00:45:41,443
back. And I didn't get either of
those positions. And they also

732
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:46,572
had really long interview
processes. And I was talking to

733
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:52,543
a- a ... partner who owns a
consultancy afterwards, and just

734
00:45:52,543 --> 00:45:55,902
saying, "This was really tough."
He was like, "Yeah, it's really-

735
00:45:55,907 --> 00:45:59,407
it's really mind blowing that
you didn't get either of those."

736
00:45:59,557 --> 00:46:02,700
[Laughs] "Yeah, it is!" Like
[laughs] -- they're like, "Well,

737
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,208
it came down between you and one

737
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:06,200
other person. I'm like, "Well,
that's great." Like -- but

738
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:06,307
[laughs] --

738
00:46:06,893 --> 00:46:10,733
Shelley: Oh yeah, I got one of
those. Actually, it was really

739
00:46:10,733 --> 00:46:13,793
-- I got the form letter email
that said it came down to one

740
00:46:13,793 --> 00:46:19,000
other person and he actually,
the -- put a PS at the end. And

741
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,500
I could read between the lines,
he wanted me with somebody else

742
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:22,700
or-

742
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,000
Bekah: Yeah.

742
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,700
Shelley: -whatever wanted the
other person. So, it was really-

743
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,000
Dan: Yeah.

743
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,000
Shelley: -clear. And he said
something

743
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,782
like, "If you ever need
mentorship, reach out." I mean-

744
00:46:29,782 --> 00:46:30,202
Bekah: That's [unintelligible].

744
00:46:30,202 --> 00:46:36,500
Shelley: -and again, it was that
reminder of- of just how good

745
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,000
parts of this industry and
community are.

746
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,300
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

747
00:46:40,300 -->> 00:46:42,700
Shelley: Like, that mentorships
built-in. It's not

746
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,288
always- not always perfectly.
But that- that was like a- a

747
00:46:47,293 --> 00:46:50,347
totally normal thing for him to
offer. And from my perspective

748
00:46:50,617 --> 00:46:54,427
coming in, that's so generous
that this is a person you

749
00:46:54,427 --> 00:46:57,907
interviewed. You- you spent an
hour and a half with them, you

750
00:46:57,907 --> 00:47:01,148
know? And you're offering to
have coffee, meet up with them,

751
00:47:01,148 --> 00:47:04,327
and help them in their career.
Like-

752
00:47:04,327 --> 00:47:04,447
Bekah: Yeah.

752
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,137
Shelley: -that's just crazy. But
also, wonderful.

753
00:47:05,858 --> 00:47:11,000
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, it's -- it --
that -- so, thinking about it

754
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,527
from the

754
00:47:11,527 --> 00:47:13,688
other side, like I- I -- well, I
haven't hired a lot of people.

755
00:47:13,688 --> 00:47:17,000
But again, my wife [laughs] has
gone through the hiring process

7566
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,617
of- of

756
00:47:17,827 --> 00:47:20,797
fair number of times over the
last year or two. And she's had

757
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:23,500
those same struggles. Like, she
really want -- loves a person

758
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,007
and then, you know,

758
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,157
somebody else, whatever. And-
and it's- it's hard on them.

759
00:47:27,217 --> 00:47:29,000
And it like, it's hard on
everybody. Like, the whole

760
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,700
process is just hard, you know?

760
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,538
Like -- a-and that doesn't --
I don't think probably

761
00:47:34,538 --> 00:47:37,898
make it easier to feel like to-
to- to accept the rejections,

762
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:40,867
you know? But it's just like,
this whole process is just a

763
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:41,700
nightmare, you know [laughs]?
Like --

764
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,000
Bekah: Yeah.

764
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,597
Dan: I don't know what we could
do to

764
00:47:43,597 --> 00:47:45,700
fix it. But like, it is. It is
so hard. It's so, like,

765
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,500
emotionally fraught, you know?
I- I don't --

766
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:47,700
Shelley: Yeah.

767
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,077
Dan: I don't know. I don't
really have a- [laughs]

766
00:47:50,728 --> 00:47:53,000
a suggestion to fix it, but it
... it's really is.

767
00:47:52,117 --> 00:47:54,367
Bekah: I feel like part of this,
like, what we're doing right now

768
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:59,378
is making a way to fix it,
right? Having open conversations

769
00:47:59,382 --> 00:48:02,737
about these things. Talking about
the problems, talking about our

770
00:48:02,742 --> 00:48:07,447
experiences to help other people
through the situation is- is a

771
00:48:07,447 --> 00:48:10,748
start to making an improvement
with how the industry does

772
00:48:10,748 --> 00:48:11,168
things.

773
00:48:11,617 --> 00:48:13,958
Dan: At least prepare people for
it [chuckles], you know?

774
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:17,047
Shelley: Yeah. Well, and
acknowledge the people that do

775
00:48:17,047 --> 00:48:17,700
it better. The interviewers that
do it-

776
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:17,900
Dan: Yes.

777
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,000
Bekah: Yes.

778
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,500
Shelley: -better.

779
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:18,700
Dan: Yes.

780
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,958
Shelley: They need to get that
feedback too.

776
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:21,500
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

776
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,378
Shelley: So that more- more do
that. Yeah.

777
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,838
Dan: Yeah. Like the- the dude
that -- the dude that would sit

778
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:27,700
and watch you and glare at you,
right? When you're doing your

779
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,297
interview. Like,

779
00:48:28,628 --> 00:48:32,527
it- it's such a- it's such a --
I mean, it's bad just like as a

780
00:48:32,527 --> 00:48:35,168
person, you know? I mean, it's
obviously just like not a nice

781
00:48:35,168 --> 00:48:37,538
thing to do. But it's also,
like, it's a bad advertisement

782
00:48:37,538 --> 00:48:40,000
for their- for their employer,
you know? And-

783
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,300
Shelley: Yeah.

784
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,700
Dan: -I don't know. And that is

783
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,757
like -- that actually is a
problem in tech is that lots of

784
00:48:46,177 --> 00:48:49,000
people in the hiring process are
not -- they're not, like, HR

785
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,500
people. They're not-

786
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:50,700
Shelley: Mm-hmm.

787
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,300
Dan: -like, people that are
doing hiring. At smaller- at

786
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,688
smaller places it can -- in tech
is like a lot of small shops,

787
00:48:55,688 --> 00:48:56,000
right?

788
00:48:56,000 -->00:48:56,300
Shelley: Yeah.

789
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:00,518
Dan: And so, you just have
developers, like, just get told,

788
00:49:00,518 --> 00:49:02,500
"Hey, run this interview." You
know what I mean? [Laughs] And

789
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,637
that is with no training,

789
00:49:03,637 --> 00:49:06,398
you know, or anything like that,
probably. And that's a

790
00:49:06,398 --> 00:49:08,157
problem too. I don't know.
There's problems everywhere.

791
00:49:08,498 --> 00:49:10,807
Shelley: Yeah. Yeah. But let's
start fixing 'em [chuckles].

792
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:12,097
Dan: Yeah. Alright.

793
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:15,398
Bekah: Alright, Shelley. Thank
you for spending time with us

794
00:49:15,398 --> 00:49:19,327
today. Do you have any last bits
of wisdom or any wins you wanna

795
00:49:19,327 --> 00:49:20,288
share before we go?

796
00:49:22,057 --> 00:49:25,748
Shelley: Oh, just that I think
I'm about to go do a demo. So

797
00:49:26,077 --> 00:49:29,000
that's my- my- my win.

798
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,300
Bekah: Yeay.

799
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,297
Shelley: I'll -- I've done a lot
of demos,

798
00:49:31,297 --> 00:49:34,297
but they've all been, you know,
mock demos. This will be the

799
00:49:34,297 --> 00:49:36,700
first time I share something
that I've built. so I'm really

800
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,478
excited about that.

801
00:49:37,568 --> 00:49:38,047
Dan: That's awesome.

802
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:41,438
Shelley: And ... yeah. I think
Virtual Coffee's probably

803
00:49:41,438 --> 00:49:45,577
responsible for a lot of it.
That's how I found ...

804
00:49:45,577 --> 00:49:49,208
Collab Lab. Cuz Ayu talked about
it. I'm like, "What is this

805
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:52,000
thing you're talking about?" And
I think it was, like, the day

806
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
before the deadline for the-

807
00:49:54,000 -->00:49:54,300
Dan: Nice.

808
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,097
Shelley: -cohort. And that I
signed up for it.

807
00:49:57,097 --> 00:49:57,500
Yeah. So it all comes around.

808
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,000
Bekah: Awesome.

809
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,700
Shelley: That's my advice. Meet people-

810
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,000
Bekah: Yeay.

808
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,527
Shelley: -talk to people. Come
to Virtual Coffee [chuckles].

809
00:50:02,902 --> 00:50:04,000
Bekah: Yeah. Alright.

810
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,700
Dan: I think that's a good
advice.

811
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,413
Bekah: Thanks so much, Shelley.

810
00:50:06,487 --> 00:50:07,208
Shelley: Thank you.
