00:00:05,858 --> 00:00:09,398
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 5, Episode 7 of the

2
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:14,877
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah, and this is a podcast that

3
00:00:14,877 --> 00:00:18,687
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:21,297
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:23,937
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:23,937 --> 00:00:26,667
stories and what they've learned.
And we are here to share it with

7
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:29,277
you. Here with me today is my
co-host, Dan.

8
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:35,167
Dan Ott: Hey, Bekah. Today, we're
talking with Meg Gutshall. And Meg

9
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:38,737
is a Ruby on Rails developer. She
has a passion for open-source,

10
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:43,627
and tech for good. She on the
podcast, talks about community

11
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,387
building, you know, and all the
stuff that she's done with

12
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:49,597
communities throughout her time,
and what brought her to her

13
00:00:49,597 --> 00:00:52,597
love for Ruby. And, also, if
you know Meg, you might know

14
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:56,082
that she's from Philly. Is that
came up once or twice in the

15
00:00:56,082 --> 00:00:57,000
podcast [laughs]?

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Meg Gutshall: Ninety.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,391
Dan: Oh, yeah. Nine [laughs] -- 98 million times, which was- which
was delightful to -- I- I have a special place in my heart for

18
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:07,391
Philadelphia. So it was a -- it's
always- it's always good to hear.

19
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:11,861
Also, Meg is- is another one of
our big volunteers at Virtual

20
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:16,662
Coffee, like Andrew last year --
last week. [Chuckles] Sorry. And --

21
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:19,221
so, she talked what she's
been doing with her

22
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:22,462
accountabil- accountability
buddies group. Accountabil-

23
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:27,171
buddies [laughs]. And- and- and
all the work she's done. Making,

24
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:29,481
you know, making spaces at
Virtual Coffee for everyone.

25
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:33,121
Bekah: Yeah. We're happy to have
Meg here with us today. And

26
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:37,682
actually, before we get started
with the podcast, Meg is here for a

27
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:38,701
special announcement.

28
00:01:39,802 --> 00:01:45,533
Meg: This episode is dedicated to
our friend, Mike Rogers. We miss

29
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:49,313
you, we love you, and we'll
never forget you.

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,034
Bekah: Thanks, Meg. We start
every episode of the podcast

31
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:55,734
like we start every Virtual
Coffee. We introduce ourselves

32
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:59,064
with our name, where we're from,
what we do, and a random check-in

33
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:11,366
question. We hope you enjoy this
episode. Today's question is, what

34
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,966
board game would you play for the
rest of your life, if you could

35
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:20,485
only play one board game? My
name is Bekah. I am a technical

36
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:24,836
community builder from a small
town in Ohio. And if I could play

37
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:29,425
one board game -- I'm not using
the word board game like kind of

38
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:34,915
loosely, so, a- a- a table game,
maybe? I really like Splendor.

39
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:37,765
I- I've been into that. I'm not very
good at it. I lose all the time.

40
00:02:38,186 --> 00:02:42,026
I think I lost to my 12-year-old,
but I like it. So I'll just keep

41
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:42,876
playing Splendor.

42
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:49,496
Dan: Splendor's cool. Hi, I'm
Dan. I do development stuff in

43
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:53,596
Cleveland, Ohio. Yeah, I don't
know. There's a lot of good board

44
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:57,286
games. Do the rules allow for
expansions, you know, and stuff,

45
00:02:57,286 --> 00:02:58,425
or is it just the base?

46
00:02:58,485 --> 00:02:59,475
Bekah: No, you can only play
the base.

47
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:02,175
Dan: [Chuckles] Only the base. Okay.
Because that change, you know, that- that

48
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:02,746
changes things, right?

49
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:03,561
Bekah: All about that base.

50
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:07,876
Dan: You know, Catan is really good.
I don't- I don't wanna have to

51
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:11,145
pick one though. It's tough. I
think I'm gonna go with Dominion

52
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:16,036
because ... that -- well, there's a lot of
different combinations. Like, e-e-each game

53
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:18,165
is a little bit different, you know?
So, I don't know, it's a little

54
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:22,841
different options. So I'm sure there is
... I don't know, the factorial height?

55
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,211
[Laughs] I'm sure there's some way
to calculate how many different, you

56
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:29,170
know, set up, so you could do for
each one, but I'm not gonna do

57
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,661
that right now cuz, you know,
it's- it's late at night

58
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:35,501
for me [laughs]. So- so, yeah.
That's my answer. Dominion.

59
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:47,866
Meg: My name's Meg, and I'm from
Philly, the home of Gritty. And I

60
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:52,000
would play Yahtzee for the rest
of my life.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Dan: Ooh.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Meg: Yahtzee is my jam. I love
it.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Bekah: I like Yahtzee.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Meg: Yeah.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:01,856
Bekah: I lose the dice though. So
then I would be out of luck. I

66
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:02,817
couldn't play anymore.

67
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:06,887
Meg: Yeah. But then you can just
ransack your other board games

68
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:11,447
and find five more dice. It's
pretty ... yeah.

69
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:13,387
Dan: It's true. Cuz you're not
allowed to play any of the other

70
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:14,076
ones. So, you know? [Chuckles]

71
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:22,242
Bekah: No, it's not true. I have a large collection of games.
So there are -- [chuckles] well, welcome Meg. We're happy

72
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:25,812
to have you here with us today.
We are -- this is like kind of a

73
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:28,961
special episode cuz we're
recording in the evening, and we

74
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:32,651
normally don't do that. So, I
don't know if I need to apologize

75
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:38,812
for that in advance [laughs], like, my
brain stops working at 3.45, every day.

76
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:39,000
So --

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Meg: Night time edition.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,442
Bekah: Welcome- welcome to the
evening edition. Well, we're gonna

79
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:50,632
let you get us started with your
origin story. So, how did you

80
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:53,601
get to this points of your --

81
00:04:56,151 --> 00:05:00,502
Meg: Oh, geez. That's a long st-
that's a ... I don't know. That is

82
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:10,752
kind of a long story, but I'll
compact it. I- I went to

83
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:17,232
school -- on to college at
Temple University. That's in

84
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:21,942
Philadelphia. Once again, home
of Gritty, the mascot for the

85
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:27,041
Flyers [Dan chuckles]. Dan earlier
said that it was for the Philly.

86
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,836
Dan: Oh, I know -- I knew I was
wrong as soon as I said it.

87
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:35,711
Meg: Yeah. Gritty's the Flyers
mascot. And I studied

88
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:42,012
Spanish at Temple, and graduated
with a Bachelors of Arts, and

89
00:05:42,072 --> 00:05:45,641
didn't wanna teach. And then I
was like, "Oh, oh, what am I gonna

90
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:51,552
do?" Translation jobs didn't
come too easily. So I just

91
00:05:51,552 --> 00:06:02,201
kind of wound up doing admin jobs, and
... I ... got a job. My first job was

92
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:08,471
at field hockey coaching and
training facility for girls 18

93
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:14,201
and under. And, it happened
to be like the number one

94
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:19,932
facility in the state of PA. And
I just knew nothing about field

95
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:25,541
hockey — I still don't. [Chuckles] But,
like, I just communicated with the

96
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:31,586
parents about, you know, having
their kids register in the

97
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:35,276
leagues and stuff, and set up
tournaments. And I learned so

98
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:43,286
much just through like running
business. And, also, I did some web

99
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:48,086
development there, just because
it was me, and my boss, and

100
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:55,302
one other employee. And then
after that, I -- one of the

101
00:06:55,331 --> 00:07:01,692
parents, when I had on-site left,
she asked if I was looking for

102
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:08,831
another place and -- to work.
And she worked at a IT

103
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:17,021
recruiting place, and they
were looking for an admin. So

104
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:23,776
that's how I got into tech. I- I didn't
know really anything about it. And

105
00:07:24,797 --> 00:07:34,247
once again, I up -- caught [??] their
website, and I saw, you know, what people

106
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:40,637
were making, and I was like, "Dang,
that's a lot [chuckles]." And these kids

107
00:07:40,637 --> 00:07:44,872
coming out of college, I was
just like, "Yeah, I'm definitely

108
00:07:44,872 --> 00:07:52,882
smarter than you are [chuckles]. Like, [Dan laughs] why
am I not doing this? Why am I not trying this?" So, I took

109
00:07:52,882 --> 00:08:04,122
like a Coursera course, and ...
tried it. I loved it. The -- it

110
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:10,541
was like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Just a very basic web thing. And so,

111
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:15,896
since I loved it so much, I dove
into it with the freeCodeCamp

112
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:23,367
bootcamp, or -- no, sorry. Oh
my gosh. Flatiron bootcamp! But

113
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:28,216
although I do very much recommend
freeCodeCamp's — freecodecamp.org

114
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:34,226
online. The Flatiron bootcamp
-- and that's where Bekah and

115
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:41,657
I met. And, yeah. Just -- that was-
that was a lot of work. Self-paced

116
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:51,226
online, well, working three
jobs, like, part-time. It was- it

117
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:57,836
was more of like, I dunno for you -- I
don't know how you'd say it. Freelancing?

118
00:08:58,586 --> 00:09:06,027
Cuz I was con- consulting for a
job, and then, I have a tenant,

119
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:15,326
and I had a pet sitting business for the
time pre-COVID [chuckles]. And, yeah.

120
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:20,937
That took a while. It was a lot
of work, but it paid off cuz now

121
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:29,876
I'm with -- I'm a consultant
with Penn medicine, and talking to

122
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:35,052
my manager about getting hired
on full time, hopefully before

123
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:37,392
the end of June. So --

124
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:40,881
Dan: That's awesome.

125
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:46,756
Bekah: Yeah, that's awesome. I think, I-
I'm trying to think of the first time

126
00:09:46,756 --> 00:09:50,187
you and I chatted, but I know
that when you were at Flatiron,

127
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:53,716
I was always impressed. So it
was like self-paced, remote, I

128
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:57,407
didn't know anybody, I, like,
hardly talked to anyone there

129
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:03,792
just because it's kind of ... hard
to ... like, I dunno, make friends

130
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:07,451
online when you don't see people.
Like, you can't, like, accidentally

131
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:10,000
run into them. And-

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Meg: Yeah.

133
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:19,152
Bekah: -you were running a study group there, that met up. And I was
like, always like, wow. I -- are you -- honestly, I thought you

134
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:23,532
worked at Flatiron because you
were so active in the Slack and

135
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:29,292
doing all these things. And I was
like, "That's awesome." And then, I

136
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:33,000
came in, I gave a talk. I think
you invited me to give a talk.

137
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Meg: Mm-hmm.

138
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,091
Bekah: I was going to give a talk
at a conference, and I think you were

139
00:10:37,091 --> 00:10:40,241
like, "Hey, wanna practice here?"
And I just remember it going so

140
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:45,912
horribly. And I'm like, "This is gonna
be really awful [laughs]." But like, I

141
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:50,381
appreciate it, kind of being able to
do that in a safe space, like,

142
00:10:50,922 --> 00:10:54,011
where nobody was going to get up and
walk out of the room [chuckles] because

143
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:59,427
it was so bad. But it, like, helped
me to recognize like where I

144
00:10:59,427 --> 00:11:04,136
really needed to practice, and I
needed to work on get- getting through

145
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:04,736
that talk.

146
00:11:05,326 --> 00:11:12,027
Meg: You- you know, I remember it
differently [chuckles]. But, yeah. You -- so

147
00:11:12,027 --> 00:11:17,517
you're definitely not the only person who
thought I was an instructor [chuckles].

148
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:24,086
I would get hit up by a lot of
other students, like asking for

149
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:29,216
help and stuff. And I- I literally
had to impose a limit for myself

150
00:11:29,216 --> 00:11:35,307
of how much I'd help people per
week. And I would just tell them,

151
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:40,706
"I reached my weekly limit of
helping people. So, I'm sorry. But

152
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:44,547
you should ask this person. I
know they're on that section

153
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:53,427
right now." And the group you
talked about, I started with

154
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:59,427
another classmate. Her name's
Sherry Martin. And she

155
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:04,677
came to me with these -- this
idea. We called it co-talk,

156
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:11,861
cuz she said she talk to someone
about -- at their bootcamp,

157
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:19,932
they had -- took turns presenting
code, and talking about

158
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:25,572
it, and using technical terms
talking about it, and how she

159
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:30,282
thought that was so cool, and like,
helpful. And she wanted someone

160
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:38,351
to help her start this. And
she, actually, left Flatiron

161
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:43,812
early for a job. She's just like
woman on a mission, could not

162
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:50,772
stop her. And so we would do a
technical challenges. I think it

163
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:58,662
was every week. And then, when
I found people like you, who

164
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:04,991
actually had something to present, or
maybe going to a conference, I will

165
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:09,072
pitch them that, "Hey, do you wanna
practice?" And I do remember --

166
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:18,511
your talk ... being, like, good.
And it was, like you said of

167
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:23,192
relaxed, like, ditching it, like,
"Hey, yeah. Just practice here.

168
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:28,682
We'll record it so you can watch it
back, and see how you did." And I

169
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:36,802
remember you saying to me, "I realize
that I need to read off a script.

170
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:44,812
So that's what I did for the actual
conference. And it went so much

171
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:51,892
better." And I was like super happy
that, like, you practicing in front

172
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:56,991
of people helped- helped you to
figure that out before the big

173
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:57,532
day [chuckles].

174
00:13:58,466 --> 00:14:01,376
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. I mean, so
many people were like, "Oh, no. You

175
00:14:01,376 --> 00:14:04,197
don't read off of -- like, you
shouldn't read off of anything, or

176
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:06,866
like have notes. Like, you should
be able to do it." I can't do

177
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:10,136
that. Like, my memory does not
work that way. I have to have

178
00:14:10,136 --> 00:14:14,336
something in front of me. I
distract myself all the time, or I

179
00:14:14,346 --> 00:14:17,907
go off on tangents, or I'll
remember that I meant to say

180
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:22,567
this thing five minutes ago, and now,
like, "What am I supposed to do? Do I

181
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:29,736
go back to that point [chuckles]?" But --
so, it was- it was really, really helpful to,

182
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:32,000
like, have that experience.

183
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Meg: Thanks. Nice to know.

184
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,287
Bekah: And I- I mean, I feel like you've done lot of that throughout
all of the stuff that you're doing. And that -- like, at Virtual

185
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:42,956
Coffee now, you know? You- you've
come on it -- you have like a

186
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:47,216
really great knack for knowing
people. I- I love that you said

187
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:51,116
that you set limits back then. Because
one, I think that's really good, and

188
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:55,496
really important, because it couldn't be
easy to, like, to help everybody all the

189
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:55,917
time.

190
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:57,121
Meg: Oh, my god. Yes [chuckles].

191
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:03,381
Bekah: And -- but- but, like, you have these
connections too, like you knew, "Okay. I

192
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:08,182
can't do this, but I can connect you with
other people." And I think that's so great

193
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:12,682
because you're- you're able to
help so many more people, and like,

194
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:18,261
hopefully preserve your- your
own self from falling into total

195
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:21,861
exhaustion by creating boundaries.
But also like showing

196
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:23,932
that it's okay to have boundaries
with things.

197
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:31,312
Meg: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think, like I say
in the beginning with- with all the

198
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:36,772
work and just like pushing
through, like you said, it's -- it-

199
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:45,981
it wasn't like ... Flatiron didn't do
a great job of creating a community for

200
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:51,302
the online self-paced students.
They're just like, "Here's

201
00:15:53,532 --> 00:16:05,351
Slack. Here you go." And, so, I did kind of --
what -- I'm [chuckles] -- I started doing with

202
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:13,532
the accountability buddies group,
just ... posting incessantly and

203
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:20,912
being so annoying that you have
to be my friend and participate.

204
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:28,782
Like, "Oh, my gosh. Okay, fine.
There -- this person's always

205
00:16:28,782 --> 00:16:32,652
posting. I guess I'll go and see
what it's all about." And then it's

206
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:36,552
like, "Oh, they're not a crazy
nut job. And there's other people

207
00:16:36,552 --> 00:16:45,922
here. You know, that -- this is pretty
cool," you know? So ... yeah, I have to

208
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:51,417
keep a little bit of my crazy nut job
and check when- when people actually

209
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:52,136
show up [Bekah chuckles].
It's hard [chuckles].

210
00:16:57,256 --> 00:17:00,466
Dan: Can you- can you tell us a
little bit more about, like, the --

211
00:17:00,716 --> 00:17:04,876
about- about the accountability group
itself, and- and, you know, what --

212
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:09,106
sort of what it is, and, you know,
how -- maybe how it started a little

213
00:17:09,106 --> 00:17:09,317
bit.

214
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:24,037
Meg: Yeah. Okay. So it was ... Sarah
Strong who put a post on Slack

215
00:17:24,037 --> 00:17:33,037
somewhere, and ... it was just
asking for an accountability partner

216
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:41,257
when job searching. Because, you
know, it's super fun when you

217
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:48,457
write cover letters, and fill
out applications with like your

218
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:55,656
address, and you going -- have to
send in your resume, and then type

219
00:17:55,656 --> 00:18:01,626
in everything that's in the f-
attachment you just sent, like,

220
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:05,977
that's all really fun. Also
getting rejection letters, and all

221
00:18:05,977 --> 00:18:13,747
that stuff, super fun. So, you
wanna share the fun with other

222
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:22,866
people, right? I'm being sarcastic, just in case
[Dan chuckles] y'all can't tell [chuckles]. But,

223
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:31,356
yeah. It's like, I'm sure a lot
of -- gosh, so many people in tech

224
00:18:31,356 --> 00:18:37,957
now, when looking for a job, it's-
it's a slog. Just like going

225
00:18:37,957 --> 00:18:44,527
through all this, and getting in
your inbox, like, "Oh, are you

226
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:50,211
interested in this?" And, like,
another recruiter just shooting

227
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:58,852
out emails to whoever. And
it's nice to have other people

228
00:18:59,392 --> 00:19:07,172
that identify with that, and to
have just like a block of time

229
00:19:07,592 --> 00:19:13,501
set aside, "Okay, I'm going to
work towards my goal of getting a

230
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:16,231
job, and this is what I'm gonna
do. And these other people are

231
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:23,031
gonna show up and do the same
thing." And so, her and I, and

232
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:28,971
Aditi ... Green. I'm pretty
sure that's her last name. We

233
00:19:28,971 --> 00:19:34,971
showed up, and it was nice. And I think
we did it two weeks in a row, and

234
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:41,271
then Sarah couldn't make it. So,
I just kinda kept it going, and

235
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:44,932
took it over, and she's like, "Oh,
no. Yeah, that's great. Like,

236
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:53,057
definitely do that." And a lot of
people who have joined to our job

237
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:58,067
seeking accountabilities group
have since left because

238
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:02,000
they're working during the
meetup time. So-

239
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Bekah: Yeay.

240
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:15,771
Meg: -yeah, it's pretty awesome. And ... yeah.
Like, people come in, say ... like -- just some

241
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:18,862
people come in, and they're like, "Ah,
it feels like I've applied for so

242
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:26,461
many, and it's just so many
rejections," and, you know, it's ... I

243
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:31,142
feel for them cuz, you know, I've
been there, you- you guys have

244
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:38,102
been there, like -- I just like,
"Okay. You got this. You- you can keep

245
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:41,872
going." And I love it when people
just drop in, even if they're not

246
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:53,467
job seeking. A lot of times,
Brett will drop in from

247
00:20:53,467 --> 00:21:00,517
Australia when he's wrapping up his
day on Friday morning — our Friday

248
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:03,000
morning, his Friday evening,
I guess.

249
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Bekah: That's late.

250
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,876
Meg: Yeah.

251
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:05,047
Bekah: What is the --

252
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:11,636
Meg: It- it's like, his family's in bed,
and he's just like, "Oh, yeah. I'm just,

253
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:18,862
you know, want to come and say hi, and
keep you company while I do this and --"

254
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:24,436
Bekah: When you -- so you ran
it through Zoom, and you have

255
00:21:24,436 --> 00:21:26,386
recently been breaking it into
different rooms, right?

256
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:33,942
Meg: Yeah. Yeah. Because
sometimes we have ... a good amount

257
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:40,656
of people come out, and, you know,
other -- everyone has their own way of

258
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:45,906
working. If someone needs it's be a
little quieter, you know, like a

259
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:50,886
breakout room for quiet
co-working, or you're just in that

260
00:21:50,886 --> 00:21:55,356
flow, but you have the presence
of another person. Like, somehow,

261
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:59,076
that just makes you feel more
accountable. Having someone there.

262
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:08,892
And then, since this month, we're
doing like, I don't -- like

263
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:16,932
job-search-type monthly challenge.
I've been adding breakout

264
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:23,442
rooms for people who want resume
reviews, or who are working on

265
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:32,082
their cover letters. If they
have anything specific, and

266
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:39,892
got their resume reviewed, say, they
can meet with whoever reviewed it in a

267
00:22:39,922 --> 00:22:46,491
breakout room. And I guess I'll
be adding different one soon.

268
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:52,192
The elevator pitch room, and
portfolio ... stuff room.

269
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:56,122
Bekah: Yeah. The second half -- well,
that starts today. I- I was off today,

270
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:58,491
so I keep forgetting it's Monday.

271
00:23:00,561 --> 00:23:02,961
Meg: What [chuckles]? I think
I worked today. Can't be Monday.

272
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:05,501
Bekah: I mean, my kids are home.
Like, my kids have been home since

273
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:08,741
last Wednesday. So, all the sense
of time is like, it's- it's

274
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:09,041
gone. Like [laughs] --

275
00:23:09,646 --> 00:23:12,227
Meg: You're slackers. You need
to be back in school. [Chuckles]

276
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:18,517
Bekah: Right? I know [chuckles]. I love
it. Having that accountability does

277
00:23:18,517 --> 00:23:22,807
make a huge difference. Because
sometimes it just seems so hard.

278
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:26,136
Like, you don't wanna do it one
more time, you don't want one more

279
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:30,487
rejection, you're tired of writing
cover letters. But knowing that

280
00:23:30,487 --> 00:23:35,346
there's somebody else there seems
to make it- it- it feels easier

281
00:23:35,346 --> 00:23:36,696
when you have that accountability.

282
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:41,811
Meg: Mm-hmm. Yeah. And sometimes, you
need to just vent to other people who

283
00:23:41,842 --> 00:23:47,122
get it, or celebrate with other
people. Like, "Oh my god, I just

284
00:23:47,122 --> 00:23:55,041
got an interview," or, "I just got
this rejection email right now."

285
00:23:55,162 --> 00:24:03,221
And, you know, either one, you
gonna get- you gonna get re-

286
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:11,761
supportive response for either
event, just from Virtual Coffee in

287
00:24:11,761 --> 00:24:18,751
general. But you're in the
accountability buddies session.

288
00:24:20,102 --> 00:24:24,991
Yeah, you can definitely find what
you need there. What are you looking

289
00:24:24,991 --> 00:24:25,422
around there [chuckles]?

290
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,606
Bekah: There- there is like
something -- there's some noise

291
00:24:28,606 --> 00:24:31,876
happening in my room, on the
other side of the room. But we

292
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:36,826
don't have animals, and none of my
children are in here. So, like, my

293
00:24:36,826 --> 00:24:40,126
12-years-old convinced that there's
a ghost in our house because he

294
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:43,247
heard a splash in his closet one night,
and then there was all this water on

295
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:47,267
the floor, okay? But it didn't drip
from it, and from anywhere. There

296
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:50,646
wasn't a glass or anything there.
I, like, literally, I was like, "I

297
00:24:50,646 --> 00:24:53,376
wonder if that was a pregnant mouse,
and its water broke." And then I

298
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:56,826
was like, "That's too much water
for a pregnant mouse," I think.

299
00:24:57,457 --> 00:24:57,936
Anyway ... so [chuckles] --

300
00:24:59,182 --> 00:25:02,291
Meg: Wait. Your 12-year-old
came up with a pregnant mouse?

301
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:04,626
Bekah: No, that was me. I came up
with a pregnant mouse. He thought

302
00:25:04,626 --> 00:25:06,277
it was a ghost. So [chuckles] --

303
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Dan: Oh my god [chuckles].

304
00:25:10,352 --> 00:25:14,432
Meg: I thought he thought it was
the ghost of a pregnant mouse.

305
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:19,626
Bekah: Well, that's even better [Meg chuckles].
But we didn't find any mice babies ...

306
00:25:20,797 --> 00:25:21,247
either.

307
00:25:21,412 --> 00:25:30,000
Meg: Oh. Yeah. That's -- let's ... not
touch that one for now. Leaving it.

308
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Bekah: [Laughs] Would you
that [??]?

309
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,201
Meg: Oh, what if you open the door, at
the closet, and Gritty would staring

310
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:39,981
out at you?

311
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:43,007
Bekah: That would be super freaky.

312
00:25:43,521 --> 00:25:44,082
Meg: Yeah, right?

313
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:47,332
Bekah: What if it the ghost of
Gritty, with the ghost of the

314
00:25:47,332 --> 00:25:47,961
pregnant mouse?

315
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:51,182
Dan: Oh my god [chuckles].

316
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,000
Meg: But Gritty's still alive.

317
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Bekah: Mm.

318
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Meg: He can never die.

319
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,071
Bekah: Well, also, I think the mouse
would probably not be pregnant anymore

320
00:25:58,071 --> 00:26:01,000
if her water broke. So, the ghost
of the once pregnant mouse-

321
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Dan: That's [chuckles] --

322
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Bekah: -be held by real-life
Gritty.

323
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Dan: This is- this is going
down real fast [laughs].

324
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,436
Bekah: Told you I'm not responsible [chuckles]
... for my brain at this time of night.

325
00:26:14,436 --> 00:26:16,201
Dan: Oh, man.

326
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:23,082
Meg: Can I just mention that ... we're
mentioning Gritty ... this is the

327
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:30,096
8th time. Because it was a
request from Party Tom for this

328
00:26:30,096 --> 00:26:33,767
episode. And Party Tom gets what
Party Tom wants [chuckles].

329
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:34,707
Dan: That's right.

330
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:35,196
Bekah: That's right.

331
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:45,771
Dan: So ... Gritty [all laughs]. We, you know, Meg
-- I- I forget if we said this on the recording

332
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:49,311
or not, but Meg asked on Slack
for questions, you know, for- for

333
00:26:49,311 --> 00:26:54,321
her -- for- for this- for this
podcast episode. And there was a

334
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,811
lot of good questions, but lot
of them were about Philly cuz

335
00:26:57,281 --> 00:27:02,602
Meg is from Philly. And, you know,
Philly is pretty ... unique, you

336
00:27:02,602 --> 00:27:04,912
know? I don't know. And- and- and
awesome, but yeah. You know --

337
00:27:04,912 --> 00:27:07,487
Meg: You mean, use [unintelligible] alone
a great question. You're bouncing [??] --

338
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:14,271
Dan: I- I have -- and- and, you know,
I -- we've -- Meg and I have talked

339
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:17,451
about this, but I- I work with
some- some people from Philly. The-

340
00:27:17,451 --> 00:27:21,261
the other side of Sprocket is- is
based in Philly. And so I get a

341
00:27:21,261 --> 00:27:23,692
little bit of Philly culture
just from that. And, one of the

342
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:27,832
favorite words that I've ever
learned is the word 'jawn'.

343
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:31,491
And I'm sure I'm not saying it well,
because I'm, you know, from Cleveland-

344
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:32,000
Meg: No. You got it.

345
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:36,307
Dan: -and not Philly. But can you- can you
just -- well, I suppose you'll have to

346
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:37,000
spell it for our listeners, and
then-

347
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Meg: Yes.

348
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,537
Dan: -can- can you just sort of define it, and
then maybe use it in a sentence or two? Just as a-

349
00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:46,346
as a- as a native, you know? I always
try to explain it to people, but I --

350
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:50,166
it- it feels, you know, it does --
it feel -- it doesn't feel right, me

351
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:54,207
talking about it, you know? So [Meg chuckles], can
you- can you -- yeah. Can you -- can -- lay on

352
00:27:54,207 --> 00:27:55,656
some- some Philly knowledge for
us?

353
00:27:56,622 --> 00:28:07,221
Meg: Yes. Jawn is spelled J.A.W.N.
It has nothing to do with sex

354
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:15,000
work. That's the first thing that people
think of when they hear that word. And --

355
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Dan: Is this [laughs] --

356
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Bekah: No! What [laughs]?

357
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Dan: This is [laughs] --

358
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:31,491
Meg: I- I've got in that reaction pretty much
every time that word comes up. [Chuckles] So,

359
00:28:32,192 --> 00:28:43,797
jawn is ... just in place of a thing.
It's a thing. It ca- it can be used as

360
00:28:43,797 --> 00:28:50,757
like a noun, or adjective, or
adverb ... maybe a verb, I'm not

361
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:51,297
sure.

362
00:28:51,862 --> 00:28:53,000
Dan: I mean, that's- that's one of
the things I love the most about it-

363
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Bekah: Jawn it.

364
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Dan: -is its utility.

365
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Meg: Yeah.

366
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Dan: So, can you --

367
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,612
Bekah: I still don't understand what it means
though. Like, [laughs] I- I need more than that.

368
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Dan: Can- can --

369
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:02,876
Meg: It's a thing. Like
something.

370
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:05,000
Dan: Can you just, like, can you
just use it?

371
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Bekah: Can you use it in a sentence?

372
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Dan: Yeah-yeah-yeah. To --

373
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:17,386
Meg: Okay. Like ... okay. For instance,
today, Nerando was ragging on Kirk

374
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:24,317
for his hair being too long and
saying, "You need a haircut." Someone

375
00:29:24,317 --> 00:29:27,057
from Philly would say, "Yo,
cut that jawn."

376
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:37,416
Dan: [Laughs] Yeah-yeah. Or a ... alright.
I'm gonna try it out. But you tell

377
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:40,836
me if it's wrong. It's, you know --
but, like ... alright. So today

378
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:45,817
I was writing some React, you
know, stuff. And then I needed to

379
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,886
save some states. So I used
that useState jawn.

380
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:48,902
Meg: Yeah. There you go.

381
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:52,882
Dan: Is that alright? Yeah. That's
easy. I can do it, see? I- I have a

382
00:29:52,882 --> 00:29:55,061
little Philly -- yeah. As I was saying, I
worked for -- with some [crosstalk] Philly,

383
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:56,000
so I get a little exposure.

384
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Meg: I mean, you were knighted.

385
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Dan: That's right-

386
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Meg: By the power vested in me
by Philly [??] --

387
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,811
Dan: -Meg knighted me because I- I translated a
Philly- Philly billboard. I only got one thing

388
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:03,201
wrong [laughs].

389
00:30:04,656 --> 00:30:06,277
Meg: Yeah, like [unintelligible]
semantic --

390
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:08,547
Bekah: So it's- it's a placeholder
word.

391
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,001
Dan: Yeah, yeah. It- it's [crosstalk]
a word that you can --

392
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,416
Bekah: It's like, if you don't know -- like
a 'thingamabobber', or 'whatchamacallit'

393
00:30:14,696 --> 00:30:15,747
that can be a jawn.

394
00:30:15,866 --> 00:30:16,406
Meg: Yeah.

395
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,271
Dan: [Chuckles] Right. Right. If
you're not from the 40s [laughs].

396
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:25,326
Meg: It's a full versioning of 'thingamabobber',
'doodad', 'whatchamacallit', a 'whozitwhatzit' [laughs].

397
00:30:26,054 --> 00:30:30,284
Bekah: Alright, there we go. I
get -- I've got it now. Thank you.

398
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:37,211
Dan: [Chuckles] That's awesome. Thank
you for that. Thank you for kind of

399
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,142
laying that down for us.

400
00:30:39,355 --> 00:30:46,000
Bekah: So, we have now covered Philly
things. And you are still in Philly-

401
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Meg: Yeah.

402
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,734
Bekah: -and you've talked about other things that
you've done in the past as -- with -- you- you had

403
00:30:55,734 --> 00:31:00,000
an animal ... what business?
[Crosstalk] Why -- you watched animals?

404
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Meg: Oh. Pet sitting business.

405
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Bekah: Okay.

406
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Meg: Yeah.

407
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:12,059
Bekah: And you have a Spanish degree. So, how- how of these
past experiences play into ... what you're doing now?

408
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:21,769
Meg: That's a great question.
They make for ... interesting

409
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:32,305
stories [Bekah chuckles]. That's
one. For Spanish, it does come up in

410
00:31:32,305 --> 00:31:42,805
translation, sometimes in, like,
working. And there's a lot of

411
00:31:42,805 --> 00:31:44,664
Spanish speakers in my area.

412
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:50,150
Bekah: I mentioned to learning a
different language when you're

413
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,490
learning to code it, there's --
it's similar, right? There's

414
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,569
overlap in how you learn and
retain that knowledge.

415
00:31:57,305 --> 00:32:06,994
Meg: Yeah, I- I ... am pretty sure that
I wrote a blog post about ... yeah.

416
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:14,065
There's -- I've wrote blog post
about, like, learning Spanish, and

417
00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:23,634
learning code, and how that was,
like, similar. It's my "Little Things

418
00:32:23,634 --> 00:32:25,194
Matter" blog posts.

419
00:32:25,724 --> 00:32:26,204
Bekah: Oh, I see it. Not
enough [??] --

420
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:36,234
Meg: Yeah. So, like, very small things
like, "Hey, I- I forgot a colon or

421
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:46,674
whatever in coding ... makes
stuff fail. And in Spanish,

422
00:32:47,244 --> 00:32:52,555
stressing the wrong syllable,
or like, pronouncing, like,

423
00:32:52,674 --> 00:32:53,934
pronunciation --"

424
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:57,980
Bekah: Did I tell you my story about
Spanish, and sleeping, and married before?

425
00:32:59,285 --> 00:33:02,825
Meg: Yeah. Co- cuz ... oh, I --

426
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:05,505
Bekah: No, I was tired.

427
00:33:05,555 --> 00:33:10,535
Meg: Yeah, you did. You did tell
me. But I think you should tell it

428
00:33:10,535 --> 00:33:10,865
again.

429
00:33:12,295 --> 00:33:16,045
Bekah: When I was, maybe 19, I went
to language school in Costa Rica by

430
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:22,884
myself. And then, I had to take a taxi
home -- or to the airport. And the

431
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:28,164
cab driver -- okay. So, though
there's, 'cansado' and 'casado'. One

432
00:33:28,164 --> 00:33:33,259
means tired, right, and one means
married. And so I thought that

433
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:38,150
he asked me if I was tired, and
I said a little bit. But he was

434
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:42,019
really asking me if I was married
[Dan chuckles]. And so I told him little

435
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:46,369
bit. And then he asked me if he could
hold my hand. And then I was afraid he

436
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:50,815
was going to kill me. So I held his hand
for the [chuckles] 40 minute ride to the

437
00:33:50,815 --> 00:33:54,565
airport. So I- I highly recommend
not telling anybody that you're a

438
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:58,974
little bit married. Just-
just go- go -- you can be fully

439
00:33:58,974 --> 00:34:03,160
married or fully tired, but don't hold
that hand of a taxi driver in Costa

440
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,595
Rica [laughs].

441
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:08,210
Dan: Yeah, a little bit seems
like, probably the absolute worst

442
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,289
answer to that question [chuckles].

443
00:34:10,164 --> 00:34:11,905
Bekah: Yeah. Well, I thought I was
tired, so --

444
00:34:12,005 --> 00:34:15,664
Meg: Can I ask you which one's,
which?

445
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,260
Bekah: I don't remember, Meg
[Bekah and Meg laugh].

446
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Dan: Lesson learned [chuckles].

447
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Bekah: I'm not gonna use it
at all cost.

448
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:28,159
Meg: [Laughs] I'm gonna just let you not
know, because I want you to make that

449
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,269
same mistake again.

450
00:34:32,518 --> 00:34:35,039
Bekah: Oh, no [chuckles]. Okay. Sorry.
I've gotten us off on a tangent again.

451
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:39,329
Oh, oh, okay. I know what I wanted
to ask. So we both went to Flatiron,

452
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:43,469
it's a full-stack bootcamp, right? And I
know, for me, I really enjoyed learning

453
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:48,018
Ruby and Rails. And I was like,
"I'm definitely going to be a Rails

454
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:54,409
developer," which I was not [laughs].
I went to -- somebody hired me. I

455
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:59,179
don't know why. And then I worked on React
projects [chuckles], which I thought was

456
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:08,358
never gonna happen. You have stuck with
Ruby [Bekah and Dan laugh]. And how

457
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:13,588
did- how did that -- how did you ...
stick with it? Did you feel that

458
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:18,958
way, or did you wanna stick with Ruby, or were
you, like, where- where I find a job, or, you

459
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:23,099
know, what- what -- how did
you make that decision?

460
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:37,369
Meg: I ... I think [silence] [exhales] you never forget
your first ... [Bekah and Dan chuckle] you know [chuckles]?

461
00:35:41,528 --> 00:35:46,958
Meg: Yeah, I really- I really
fell in love with Ruby. And in

462
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:54,849
Flatiron, the order that they
taught us — which now is

463
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:06,248
flip-flopped — they did Ruby
first, and then Sinatra, and

464
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:11,588
Rails frameworks, and then
JavaScript with React and Redux

465
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:21,923
frameworks. And I think that I was
able to -- I took a longer time

466
00:36:21,954 --> 00:36:27,324
going through Ruby, Sinatra, and
Rails so it allowed me to get

467
00:36:27,324 --> 00:36:33,143
like a really good appreciation
for the language. And also a

468
00:36:33,143 --> 00:36:40,614
friend of mine from Flatiron,
Heather Miller — she's down in DC —

469
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:46,844
she invited me to this
conference called Ruby for Good.

470
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:55,208
And that's when I just started Rails.
Both of us. And it was like the

471
00:36:55,208 --> 00:37:01,179
people there were so nice. It
was, I think three days, everyone

472
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:08,048
was so nice and friendly. We're
making -- we were working on apps

473
00:37:08,048 --> 00:37:14,949
for social good, to do things
for people. And I knew next to

474
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:21,684
nothing, but people were still like, "Oh,
you can- you can totally help. You can

475
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:26,994
definitely be, you know, a
contributing member of our team."

476
00:37:27,864 --> 00:37:34,463
And it -- that made me really fall
in love with the Ruby community.

477
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:44,923
And I found that that's a very ...
universal mindset of the

478
00:37:44,923 --> 00:37:50,423
Ruby community. The people are
very, very nice, and welcoming, and

479
00:37:50,423 --> 00:37:56,664
willing to teach. And similarly,
that's how the Philly tech

480
00:37:56,693 --> 00:38:04,583
community has been in my personal
experience. Before the

481
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:11,393
pandemic, I was networking a lot
in person, and found a lot of

482
00:38:12,684 --> 00:38:23,199
people very welcoming, and open,
like to, you know, a woman in

483
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:32,398
tech, and someone from like a nontraditional
path. And Philly's definitely a

484
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:42,478
colorful city, like in different --
in ways of diversity, and

485
00:38:42,478 --> 00:38:48,543
it's blending- it's blending
into the tech community heavily.

486
00:38:48,664 --> 00:38:56,474
And I think ... that makes it
very welcoming. And I saw just

487
00:38:56,474 --> 00:38:59,353
both of those in the Ruby
community and Philly tech

488
00:38:59,353 --> 00:39:04,844
community. The- the issue was,
there- there weren't -- there

489
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:13,539
wasn't a lot of Ruby on Rails
in Philly at the time. So I was

490
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:17,588
just like, "Oh, no." So I was
ready to get a job's doing

491
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:23,528
anything. But then, once the
pandemic happened, like a silver

492
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:29,139
lining of that, was remote work.
Now the world is my oyster. I

493
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:36,579
could get a Rails job for anywhere,
just working from my desk at

494
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:41,409
home. So that definitely-
that definitely helped with my

495
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:47,768
job search, having like that focus
on Rails jobs. Like, this is

496
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:54,039
what I love, this is what I wanna
do. And, especially, having

497
00:39:54,039 --> 00:40:02,318
like- like now, I'm on the core
team of Ruby for Good. And I

498
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:10,429
enjoy -- I really enjoy doing that,
and work that's meaningful, and

499
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:19,369
fulfilling, and that it helps
people. So that was like

500
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:23,478
something that I really would've --
like, to do as well. And I was targeting

501
00:40:23,478 --> 00:40:28,759
companies like that, that were
Rails companies as well.

502
00:40:31,403 --> 00:40:35,514
Dan: Is the -- so your position with Ruby for Good
is a volunteer ... [crosstalk] position, right?

503
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Meg: Yeah. Yeah.

504
00:40:36,054 --> 00:40:39,474
Dan: As -- I- I was pretty sure that -- is-
is that -- so, can you talk a little bit more

505
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:44,273
about, like, what you- what you all
do as an organization? I think you- I

506
00:40:44,273 --> 00:40:46,224
think you talked a little bit
about their conference, but, you

507
00:40:46,224 --> 00:40:49,943
know, can you just kinda explain Ruby
for Good as a, you know, as a- as an

508
00:40:49,943 --> 00:40:50,784
organization and --

509
00:40:52,373 --> 00:41:00,114
Meg: You're saying -- yeah. Ruby for Good
is a nonprofit, and it's volunteer led.

510
00:41:00,233 --> 00:41:10,164
Sean Marcia is the founder, and
it's largely -- it's- it's based

511
00:41:10,164 --> 00:41:16,974
in DC. So the membership is
largely in DC. But definitely

512
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:24,744
expanding. And basically, it's
uses something called skills-based

513
00:41:24,744 --> 00:41:30,728
volunteering, which is people in
the tech community use their

514
00:41:31,028 --> 00:41:36,849
specialized set of skills, like
Liam Neeson. But they do good

515
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:46,268
things to them [chuckles]. They
build software for other nonprofits,

516
00:41:46,449 --> 00:41:55,994
and -- so that might be like a
website, or a sign-up form, or

517
00:41:56,833 --> 00:42:05,353
like an actual software system.
Something that it -- like, are

518
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:10,213
probably -- I think is the oldest
project, and probably the biggest,

519
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:17,054
is called Human Essentials. It
was rebranded from Diaper Based,

520
00:42:17,804 --> 00:42:26,143
and it had started out as ...
inventory management system for

521
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:35,503
Diaper Banks, and ... it- it started
like that. And then, it grew because

522
00:42:35,534 --> 00:42:40,454
they're like, "Okay, this awesome."
Now look at -- the Diaper Banks are

523
00:42:40,454 --> 00:42:44,143
receiving these products, they're
giving the products to their

524
00:42:44,143 --> 00:42:49,844
partners like churches, and food
pantries, and homeless shelters

525
00:42:49,873 --> 00:42:56,083
who then to -- distribute the
products to families. So they

526
00:42:56,083 --> 00:43:01,873
wanted a way to -- for their
partners to track what was

527
00:43:01,873 --> 00:43:07,963
needed, and who got stuff. So they
made Partner Base to go along

528
00:43:08,684 --> 00:43:13,333
with Diaper Base. Then it's like,
"Okay. Well, these items aren't

529
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:18,248
just diapers. They're also
feminine care products, soaps,

530
00:43:18,268 --> 00:43:26,699
creams, like shampoos, things like
that." So, they kind of merged

531
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:34,469
both of 'em together, and called it
Human Essentials in -- and serving

532
00:43:35,128 --> 00:43:39,000
almost 200 Diaper Banks right
now. But then-

533
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Dan: That's ... really cool.

534
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:52,284
Meg: -there's also stuff, like, there's a- a lending
library in Chicago, that -- it's a circulation system

535
00:43:52,373 --> 00:44:01,786
for, like, tools and other types of equipment
for this lending library. And CASA —

536
00:44:02,126 --> 00:44:07,139
court appointed advocate --
let me look it up real quicks. I

537
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:08,340
don't want to --

538
00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:09,429
Dan: A special advocate -- court-
court of -- Court Appointed Special Advocate.

539
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,539
Meg: Yeah. Court Appointed
Special Advocate.

540
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:13,239
Dan: Like, I google from there
[??] [chuckles].

541
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:22,179
Meg: And that's just a system
to track volunteer time. So it-

542
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:29,795
it ranges for different needs, and it's
-- it feels like it's all open-source

543
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:34,385
contribution. So people can
get involved with just one

544
00:44:34,385 --> 00:44:40,175
project, do it like one or two
pull requests and be done, or

545
00:44:40,175 --> 00:44:46,864
they can get involved heavily.
And these projects have like

546
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:52,804
weekly office hours, and
stakeholder meetings, and things.

547
00:44:53,885 --> 00:44:58,619
And ... yeah. It's something that
really spoke to me. And I'm- I'm

548
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:03,210
a very organized person by
nature since I used to work

549
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:10,019
as an admin. So I- I told Sean,
I was like, "Yeah. Let me- let

550
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:15,510
me help out however I can [giggles]." So,
he's like, "Yeah, [crosstalk] let's do this.

551
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:15,989
Come on."

552
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,800
Dan: Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, I'm sure.
No, that's really great. It- it seems

553
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:28,699
like really interesting organization. That-
that sort of thing, I always wonder ... so you

554
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:36,050
make a product for another
nonprofit, right? Does Ruby

555
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,019
for Good end up maintaining that
over time, or- or is it like a

556
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:43,070
sort of a handoff kind of thing, or ... you
know? This is just of me -- my curiosity.

557
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:44,719
I've always been curious
about it [chuckles].

558
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:52,244
Meg: Yeah. I think ... I
think it depends. I want --

559
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:55,739
Dan: Yeah. I mean, I suppose
-- oh, go ahead.

560
00:45:56,925 --> 00:46:03,224
Meg: There's many where we maintain
it, and there's some that that's

561
00:46:03,224 --> 00:46:09,284
just kind of a one and done
thing. Like some, it's ... I need

562
00:46:09,465 --> 00:46:16,264
something that does A, B and C.
And once it's done, they use it.

563
00:46:17,434 --> 00:46:21,574
They're like, "Oh, can you change
this and that?" "Okay." And then

564
00:46:21,574 --> 00:46:24,844
they're like, "Awesome. Thank you
so much. Now we don't have to go

565
00:46:24,844 --> 00:46:30,065
and buy this stuff." And they can
use their money on other stuff that

566
00:46:30,065 --> 00:46:37,625
they need. And they don't need like
updates, and stuff like that.

567
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:42,704
Cuz it's not like -- these
other nonprofits are full of

568
00:46:43,655 --> 00:46:46,894
volunteers. Like, they may have
a few employees depending on the

569
00:46:46,894 --> 00:46:54,005
nonprofit, but the goal is to
just spread help to other people,

570
00:46:54,954 --> 00:46:58,894
and especially the organizations
that don't have vast resources.

571
00:46:59,405 --> 00:47:03,304
Dan: Oh, that's- that's cool. And-
and so, they- they do a lot of their

572
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:07,039
projects, sort of open-source
too, right?

573
00:47:07,164 --> 00:47:08,934
Meg: Yeah. Yep. Like, everything --

574
00:47:09,699 --> 00:47:11,289
Dan: Is it all of them, or is
there -- are there some --

575
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,849
everything? Yeah. That's so cool.

576
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:18,260
Meg: Yeah. So you can just go on GitHub, and go
in there, and check it out. And [unintelligible] --

577
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,420
Dan: Yeah. Anybody who's listening to
this can go or contribute, right? I think

578
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,460
that's so cool. That's such a
cool organization.

579
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:33,510
Meg: It- it makes stuff like that, like
-- well, I guess we jazzed up about

580
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:43,425
open-source. Just ... you know how,
when you -- if you toss a rock into

581
00:47:43,425 --> 00:47:51,045
a calm, cold water in the ripples go out?
It's -- that's how I view open-source.

582
00:47:51,045 --> 00:48:00,195
Like, you can make a change
on some code in that, and

583
00:48:00,195 --> 00:48:06,224
it spreads from there. Whoever
forks that repository gets your

584
00:48:06,224 --> 00:48:13,320
change. Whoever uses the
software gets your change. And

585
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:22,920
it's spreads however far this
piece of software goes. And you-

586
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:30,119
you just don't know when you
start. Like, there's that badge

587
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:37,139
on GitHub, the Mars Rover badge. Like,
so many people contributed to code

588
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:49,065
that put a robot on Mars, and didn't
know until they got that badge. And

589
00:48:49,065 --> 00:48:55,664
it's ... like, you can say that like,
"Oh yeah, you know, I wrote some

590
00:48:55,664 --> 00:48:57,074
code for the Mars Rover," like, "No big
[exhales]." [Bekah and Dan chuckle] So --

591
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:08,364
Bekah: Yeah. I love that. I- I was
just talking to someone ... last week,

592
00:49:08,423 --> 00:49:13,523
about HacktoberFest, and that happens in
October [Meg giggles]. But I'm like already

593
00:49:13,554 --> 00:49:16,643
getting super excited for that.
Cuz it's -- I dunno. It's like,

594
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:19,793
it's great to do as part of
Virtual Coffee and see people

595
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:23,784
contributing. But, there's-
there are so many good

596
00:49:24,054 --> 00:49:28,043
projects out there that people
can contribute to, and figuring

597
00:49:28,043 --> 00:49:30,893
out ... I don't know. The best way
to put people in touch with them

598
00:49:30,893 --> 00:49:34,434
cuz it can be overwhelming getting
into open-source, but like making

599
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:39,579
that easily accessible is- is a-
a goal for this year, for sure.

600
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:44,628
Meg: Yeah. Same. I'm trying to do
that with the Ruby for Good website,

601
00:49:45,228 --> 00:49:54,559
trying to clean it. It's a -- I
have a 3000 line style sheet to

602
00:49:54,588 --> 00:50:04,259
clean up be-before HacktoberFest
kicks off. Also, my HacktoberFest

603
00:50:04,278 --> 00:50:09,259
challenge from last year to
Virtual Coffee went woefully

604
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:10,248
unanswered.

605
00:50:10,686 --> 00:50:11,646
Bekah: What was your challenge?

606
00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:11,646
Dan: Uh-oh.

607
00:50:12,856 --> 00:50:14,085
Meg: Dan remembers, right?

608
00:50:15,751 --> 00:50:16,590
Dan: I'd [chuckles] -- oh,
I'm blanking now.

609
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:24,215
Meg: It -- I said for- for every
first time contributor to make a pull

610
00:50:24,215 --> 00:50:32,085
request in October, I would take a shot.
[Dan laughs] And I only took three

611
00:50:32,085 --> 00:50:34,115
shots. The whole month.

612
00:50:34,351 --> 00:50:35,331
Dan: Well, we --

613
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,130
Bekah: Oh, I think maybe we --
you needed to take 70, okay. So-

614
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:38,721
Dan: Yeah [laughs].

615
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:40,650
Bekah: -pace yourself [chuckles].

616
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:45,501
Dan: Well ... yeah. That- that happened
because it -- I -- we were so burnt

617
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:48,650
out from HacktoberFest that it
took me like a month and a half to

618
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:51,681
actually pull together any stats.
And by that time, I had- I had

619
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:52,490
totally forgotten.

620
00:50:53,641 --> 00:50:53,911
Bekah: Yeah. We should-

621
00:50:54,005 --> 00:50:55,085
Dan: Well, we're just gonna have
to redo it. We'll have- we'll have-

622
00:50:55,141 --> 00:50:55,621
Bekah: -we can fill that in,
this year.

623
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:57,925
Dan: -to redo this year. Yeah.
We'll- we'll do it, Meg.

624
00:50:58,476 --> 00:51:01,476
A Meg shot counter, you know? We'll-
we'll build it so that we won't- we

625
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:09,065
won't forget [Dan and Meg chuckle]. I mean, we- we-
we have -- well, I'll have to think of some, you

626
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:12,606
know, stretch goals and stuff [chuckles].
Because we also don't want, you

627
00:51:12,606 --> 00:51:19,940
know ... well, we don't want you to die [crosstalk]
[laughs], like from- from too many shots. So --

628
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Bekah: Yeah, true. Like [chuckles],
we give you life.

629
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,150
Meg: I'll be fine.

630
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:20,175
Dan: [Chuckles] I'll be fine.

631
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:30,166
Meg: I just- I just might forget
some things like, how to walk,

632
00:51:30,166 --> 00:51:30,496
or [Bekah and Dan chuckle] ...
you know?

633
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,891
Dan: We'll make sure you're nice and
comfy on your couch first [chuckles].

634
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:39,000
Meg: Yeah. Exactly.

635
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Bekah: Well, Meg --

636
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:50,844
Meg: I had- I had a silly origin
story for Kirk, if you had time.

637
00:51:51,324 --> 00:51:51,925
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

638
00:51:51,925 --> 00:51:52,664
Bekah: Of course.

639
00:51:52,664 --> 00:52:02,295
Meg: We talked about forgetting
something. So, in May, there's this

640
00:52:02,295 --> 00:52:12,014
thing called Philly Tech Week.
And this year, it's going

641
00:52:12,014 --> 00:52:19,065
May 6th through May 14th, and
it's hold on by Technical.ly

642
00:52:19,065 --> 00:52:28,724
Philly. A lot of the events are
gonna be virtual, I believe.

643
00:52:29,204 --> 00:52:33,105
I- I think some may be in-person,
but I think a lot will still be

644
00:52:33,105 --> 00:52:38,144
virtual, but this is a annual
thing. I think it's the 12th

645
00:52:38,144 --> 00:52:47,639
year this year. I'm not
positive. But in 2019, I

646
00:52:47,909 --> 00:52:55,199
applied for a scholarship to go
to one of their keynote events

647
00:52:56,699 --> 00:53:03,059
and- and got the scholarship. And
there was just like all day, all

648
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:07,500
these presentations, and it was at
-- I'm pretty sure it was at the

649
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:12,900
Comcast Center cuz it's like
one of the big tech hubs in

650
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:22,230
Philly. A lot of people are reluctant
about that being [chuckles] a big

651
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:27,570
tech spot in Philly. Gritty was there. Gritty
showed up in-person [Bekah and Dan chuckles].

652
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:35,280
Yeah. And, yeah. It was really
cool. Got to like network and

653
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:41,574
meet a whole bunch of people.
And then there was a after party

654
00:53:41,574 --> 00:53:51,065
thing to go out to a bar. And ...
I networked with people at these

655
00:53:51,065 --> 00:53:58,375
tables, and ... I was talking with
this one group, and the people

656
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:01,974
just seem super nice. I think I put
down my backpack on the table, and

657
00:54:02,514 --> 00:54:08,780
they came to set up, and I was ... I
don't- I don't know. Moving things around

658
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,610
my backpack or something, and
saying, "Oh, sorry. I'll get out

659
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:14,070
of here." And they're like, "Oh, no,
it's fine," and we just started

660
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:19,920
chatting. And I found them later
at the happy hour. And it turned

661
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:27,300
out that, one of their C level
employees was visiting from the

662
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:33,119
West Coast. And he was buying us all
drinks for happy hour. He's like,

663
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:36,719
"Hey, do you wanna drink?" cu-cuz
I was just hanging out, talking

664
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:42,360
with them. And, so I got like
really roped up on this company's

665
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:48,269
dime [Dan chuckles], and went to the
after parties after party, and they had

666
00:54:48,269 --> 00:54:57,554
this awesome DJ. And that was like the
technically Philly people. We're like, "Now we can

667
00:54:57,554 --> 00:55:02,264
let loose cuz the day's done." And
they're all dancing, and having

668
00:55:02,264 --> 00:55:08,235
fun and stuff. And then I looked
at my clock, and it was like

669
00:55:08,235 --> 00:55:12,644
1.30 or something. And the last
train had come and left [chuckles].

670
00:55:14,264 --> 00:55:15,195
Bekah: Oh, no.

671
00:55:16,005 --> 00:55:18,195
Meg: I was just like, "Oh,
no. What did I do [laughs]?"

672
00:55:21,795 --> 00:55:29,235
And it was really warm, so I
just walked around Philly. And

673
00:55:29,235 --> 00:55:35,114
so -- and I was like trying to
make it until the morning when the

674
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:38,000
train station open cuz I
didn't have-

675
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Dan: [Chuckles] Oh, no.

676
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:50,054
Meg: -enough money to take an Uber [laughs]. And
there's this guy that -- some guy in a wheelchair

677
00:55:50,054 --> 00:55:59,114
scooter was coming down the street,
yelling at me, [laughs] he's following me.

678
00:55:59,144 --> 00:56:06,815
And I'm just like, "Ah ... [exhales] okay. I guess I'm
gonna have to like look up the credit card, and take

679
00:56:06,815 --> 00:56:13,684
the Uber [laughs]." But it
was a great night.

680
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:23,610
Bekah: [Bekah and Dan laugh] Oh, that is
awesome. Well, Meg, it's been really great

681
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:28,380
having you on the podcast,
finally. Before we go, are

682
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:33,119
there any last fun Philly facts
that you would like to share with

683
00:56:33,449 --> 00:56:34,469
our listeners?

684
00:56:35,293 --> 00:56:43,086
Meg: I would like to say, we have
amazing food. If you're ever in town,

685
00:56:44,226 --> 00:56:49,717
I encourage you go to the
Reading Terminal Market,

686
00:56:50,246 --> 00:56:58,487
basically ... like, weekdays are
best. Because the Mennonite people

687
00:56:58,487 --> 00:57:03,916
are there with like that good
home cook Pennsylvania Dutch

688
00:57:03,947 --> 00:57:10,396
food. And although we
mentioned Gritty definitely more

689
00:57:10,396 --> 00:57:14,717
than eight times at this podcast,
there's also the Philly Phanatic, who is

690
00:57:14,717 --> 00:57:21,617
an amazing mascot. And I- I can't
leave him out either. Yeah.

691
00:57:22,907 --> 00:57:26,367
Those are my fun Philly
facts for all of you.
