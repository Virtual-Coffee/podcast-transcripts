00:00:05,858 --> 00:00:07,628
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 5, Episode 7

2
00:00:07,628 --> 00:00:09,398
of the

3
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:12,137
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah, and this is a podcast

4
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,876
that

5
00:00:14,877 --> 00:00:18,687
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

6
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:19,992
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

7
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:21,297
their coding

8
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:23,937
journey. And they're here, on
this podcast, sharing their

9
00:00:23,937 --> 00:00:25,302
stories and what they've
learned. And we are here to

10
00:00:25,302 --> 00:00:26,667
share it with

11
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:29,277
you. Here with me today is my
co-host, Dan.

12
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:32,796
Dan Ott: Hey, Bekah. Today,
we're talking with Meg Gutshall.

13
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:35,166
And Meg

14
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:36,952
is a Ruby on Rails developer.
She has a passion for

15
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:38,737
open source,

16
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:43,627
and tech for good. She on the
podcast, talks about community

17
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,387
building, you know, and all the
stuff that she's done with

18
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:49,597
communities throughout her time,
and what brought her to her

19
00:00:49,597 --> 00:00:52,597
love for Ruby. And, also, if you
know Meg, you might know

20
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:56,082
that she's from Philly. Is that
came up once or twice in the

21
00:00:56,082 --> 00:00:57,000
podcast [laughs]?

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Meg Gutshall: Ninety.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,130
Dan: Oh, yeah. Nine [laughs]--
98 million times, which was-

24
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,390
which was delightful to-- I- I
have a special place in my heart

25
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:05,891
for Philadelphia. So it was a--
it's always- it's always good to

26
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,391
hear.

27
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:11,861
Also, Meg is- is another one of
our big volunteers at Virtual

28
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:16,661
Coffee, like Andrew last year--
last week. [Chuckles] Sorry. And

29
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:19,221
so, she talked what she's been
doing with her

30
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:22,462
accountabil- accountability
buddies group. Accountabil-

31
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:27,171
buddies [laughs] and- and- and
all the work she's done, making,

32
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:29,481
you know, making spaces at
Virtual Coffee for everyone.

33
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:33,121
Bekah: Yeah. We're happy to have
Meg here with us today. And

34
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:37,681
actually, before we get started
with the podcast, Meg is here

35
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:38,701
for a special announcement.

36
00:01:39,802 --> 00:01:45,532
Meg: This episode is dedicated
to our friend, Mike Rogers. We

37
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:49,313
miss you, we love you, and we'll
never forget you.

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,034
Bekah: Thanks, Meg. We start
every episode of the podcast

39
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:55,734
like we start every Virtual
Coffee. We introduce ourselves

40
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:57,399
with our name, where we're from,
what we do, and a random

41
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:59,064
check-in

42
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:05,215
question. We hope you enjoy this
episode. Today's question is,

43
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:11,366
what

44
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:13,255
board game would you play for
the rest of your life, if you

45
00:02:13,255 --> 00:02:14,965
could

46
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:20,485
only play one board game? My
name is Bekah. I am a technical

47
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:22,660
community builder from a small
town in Ohio. And if I could

48
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,835
play

49
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:27,130
one board game-- I'm not using
the word board game, like, kind

50
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,424
of

51
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:34,915
loosely, so, a- a- a table game,
maybe? I really like Splendor.

52
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:37,764
I- I've been into that. I'm not
very good at it. I lose all the

53
00:02:38,186 --> 00:02:40,106
time. I think I lost to my
12-year-old, but I like it. So,

54
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:42,876
I'll just keep playing Splendor.

55
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:49,496
Dan: Splendor's cool. Hi, I'm
Dan. I do development stuff in

56
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:51,576
Cleveland, Ohio. Yeah, I don't
know. There's a lot of good

57
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:53,596
board

58
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:57,286
games. Do the rules allow for
expansions, you know, and stuff,

59
00:02:57,286 --> 00:02:58,425
or is it just the base?

60
00:02:58,485 --> 00:02:59,475
Bekah: No, you can only play the
base.

61
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:01,240
Dan: [Chuckles] Only the base.
Okay. Because that change, you

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,746
know, that- that changes things,
right?

63
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:03,561
Bekah: All about that base.

64
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:05,895
Dan: You know, Catan is really
good. I don't- I don't wanna

65
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,875
have to

66
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:11,145
pick one though. It's tough. I
think I'm gonna go with Dominion

67
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:13,695
because ... that-- well, there's
a lot of different

68
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:16,035
combinations. Like, e-e-each
game

69
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:17,100
is a little bit different, you
know? So, I don't know-- it's a

70
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,164
little

71
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,503
different options. So I'm sure
there is ... I don't know-- the

72
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:22,841
factorial height?

73
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,190
[Laughs] I'm sure there's some
way to calculate how many

74
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,210
different, you

75
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:27,190
know, set up, so you could do
for each one, but I'm not gonna

76
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,661
do that right now cuz, you know,
it's- it's late at night

77
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:35,501
for me [laughs]. So- so, yeah.
That's my answer. Dominion.

78
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:47,866
Meg: My name's Meg, and I'm from
Philly—the home of Gritty. And

79
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:52,000
I would play Yahtzee for the
rest of my life.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Dan: Ooh.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Meg: Yahtzee is my jam. I love
it.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Bekah: I like Yahtzee.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Meg: Yeah.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,001
Bekah: I lose the dice though.
So then I would be out of luck.

85
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:02,817
I couldn't play anymore.

86
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:06,887
Meg: Yeah. But then you can just
ransack your other board games

87
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:11,447
and find five more dice. It's
pretty ... yeah.

88
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:13,387
Dan: It's true. Cuz you're not
allowed to play any of the other

89
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:14,076
ones. So, you know? [Chuckles]

90
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:19,601
Bekah: No, it's not true. I have
a large collection of games. So

91
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:22,241
there are-- [chuckles] well,
welcome Meg. We're happy

92
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:25,812
to have you here with us today.
We are-- this is, like, kind of

93
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:28,961
a special episode cuz we're
recording in the evening, and we

94
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,806
normally don't do that. So, I
don't know if I need to

95
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:32,651
apologize

96
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:35,731
for that in advance [laughs],
like, my brain stops working at

97
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:39,000
three fourty five, every day.
So--

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Meg: Night time edition.

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,221
Bekah: Welcome- welcome to the
evening edition. Well, we're

100
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:45,442
gonna

101
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:50,632
let you get us started with your
origin story. So, how did you

102
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:53,601
get to this points of your--

103
00:04:56,151 --> 00:05:00,501
Meg: Oh, geez. That's a long st-
that's a ... I don't know. That

104
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:10,752
is kind of a long story, but
I'll compact it. I- I went to

105
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:17,232
school on-- to college at Temple
University. That's in

106
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:21,942
Philadelphia. Once again, home
of Gritty—the mascot for the

107
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:24,491
Flyers [Dan chuckles]. Dan
earlier said that it was for the

108
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,040
Philly.

109
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,836
Dan: Oh, I know-- I knew I was
wrong as soon as I said it.

110
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:35,711
Meg: Yeah. Gritty's the Flyers
mascot. And I studied

111
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:42,012
Spanish at Temple, and graduated
with a Bachelors of Arts, and

112
00:05:42,072 --> 00:05:43,856
didn't wanna teach. And then, I
was like, "Oh, oh, what am I

113
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:45,640
gonna

114
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:51,552
do?" Translation jobs didn't
come too easily. So I just

115
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:56,876
kind of wound up doing admin
jobs, and ... I ... got a job.

116
00:05:56,876 --> 00:06:02,200
My first job was

117
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:08,471
at field hockey coaching and
training facility for girls 18

118
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:14,201
and under. And, it happened to
be, like, the number one

119
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:19,932
facility in the state of PA. And
I just knew nothing about field

120
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:22,736
hockey—I still don't. [Chuckles]
But, like, I just

121
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:25,540
communicated with the

122
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:31,586
parents about, you know, having
their kids register in the

123
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:35,276
leagues and stuff, and set up
tournaments. And I learned so

124
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:39,281
much just through, like, running
business. And, also, I did some

125
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:43,286
web

126
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:48,086
development there, just because
it was me, and my boss, and

127
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:55,302
one other employee. And then,
after that, I-- one of the

128
00:06:55,331 --> 00:07:01,691
parents, when I had on-site
left, she asked if I was looking

129
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:08,831
for another place and-- to work.
And she worked at a IT

130
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:17,021
recruiting place, and they were
looking for an admin. So

131
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:20,398
that's how I got into tech. I- I
didn't know really anything

132
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,775
about it. And

133
00:07:24,797 --> 00:07:29,522
once again, I up-- caught [??]
their website, and I saw, you

134
00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:34,247
know, what people

135
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:37,442
were making, and I was like,
"Dang, that's a lot [chuckles]."

136
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:40,637
And these kids

137
00:07:40,637 --> 00:07:44,872
coming out of college, I was
just like, "Yeah, I'm definitely

138
00:07:44,872 --> 00:07:48,877
smarter than you are [chuckles].
Like, [Dan laughs] why am I not

139
00:07:48,877 --> 00:07:52,882
doing this? Why am I not trying
this?" So, I took,

140
00:07:52,882 --> 00:08:04,122
like, a Coursera course, and ...
tried it. I loved it. The-- it

141
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:07,331
was, like, HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. Just a very basic

142
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:10,540
web thing. And so,

143
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:15,896
since I loved it so much, I dove
into it with the freeCodeCamp

144
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:23,367
bootcamp, or-- no, sorry. Oh my
gosh. Flatiron bootcamp! But

145
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:25,851
although I do very much
recommend freeCodeCamp's--

146
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:28,215
freecodecamp.org

147
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:34,226
online. The Flatiron bootcamp--
and that's where Bekah and

148
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:37,941
I met. And, yeah. Just-- that
was- that was a lot of work.

149
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:41,656
Self-paced

150
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:46,441
online, well, working three
jobs, like, part-time. It was-

151
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:54,531
it was more of, like, I dunno
for you-- I don't know how you'd

152
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:57,836
say it. Freelancing?

153
00:08:58,586 --> 00:09:06,027
Cuz I was con- consulting for a
job, and then I have a tenant,

154
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:10,706
and I had a pet sitting business
for the time pre-COVID

155
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:15,326
[chuckles]. And-- yeah.

156
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:20,937
That took a while. It was a lot
of work, but it paid off cuz now

157
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:29,875
I'm with-- I'm a consultant with
Penn Medicine, and talking to

158
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:35,052
my manager about getting hired
on full time, hopefully before

159
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:37,392
the end of June. So--

160
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:40,881
Dan: That's awesome.

161
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:44,311
Bekah: Yeah, that's awesome. I
think-- I- I'm trying to think

162
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:46,756
of the first time

163
00:09:46,756 --> 00:09:50,187
you and I chatted, but I know
that when you were at Flatiron,

164
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:53,716
I was always impressed. So it
was, like, self-paced, remote, I

165
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:57,407
didn't know anybody, I, like,
hardly talked to anyone there

166
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:00,599
just because it's kind of ...
hard to ... like, I dunno, make

167
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:03,791
friends

168
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:07,451
online when you don't see
people. Like, you can't, like,

169
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:10,000
accidentally run into them. And-

170
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Meg: Yeah.

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,050
Bekah: -you were running a study
group there, that met up. And I

172
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,100
was, like-- always, like, "Wow."
I-- are you-- honestly, I

173
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,150
thought you

174
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:23,532
worked at Flatiron because you
were so active in the Slack and

175
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:26,412
doing all these things. And I
was like, "That's awesome." And

176
00:10:26,412 --> 00:10:29,292
then, I

177
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:33,000
came in, I gave a talk. I think
you invited me to give a talk.

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Meg: Mm-hmm.

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,545
Bekah: I was going to give a
talk at a conference, and I

180
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:37,090
think you were

181
00:10:37,091 --> 00:10:38,666
like, "Hey, wanna practice
here?" And I just remember it

182
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,241
going so

183
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:43,076
horribly. And I'm like, "This is
gonna be really awful [laughs]."

184
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,911
But, like, I

185
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,146
appreciate it, kind of being
able to do that in a safe space,

186
00:10:48,146 --> 00:10:52,466
like, where nobody was going to
get up and walk out of the room

187
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:54,010
[chuckles] because

188
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:56,719
it was so bad. But it, like,
helped me to recognize, like,

189
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:59,427
where I

190
00:10:59,427 --> 00:11:01,781
really needed to practice and I
needed to work on get- getting

191
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:04,736
through that talk.

192
00:11:05,326 --> 00:11:08,676
Meg: You- you know, I remember
it differently [chuckles]. But--

193
00:11:08,676 --> 00:11:12,026
yeah. You-- so,

194
00:11:12,027 --> 00:11:14,772
you're definitely not the only
person who thought I was an

195
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:17,517
instructor [chuckles].

196
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:24,086
I would get hit up by a lot of
other students, like, asking for

197
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:26,651
help and stuff. And I- I
literally had to impose a limit

198
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:29,216
for myself

199
00:11:29,216 --> 00:11:32,261
of how much I'd help people per
week. And I would just tell

200
00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:35,306
them,

201
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:38,051
"I reached my weekly limit of
helping people. So, I'm sorry.

202
00:11:38,051 --> 00:11:40,705
But

203
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:44,547
you should ask this person. I
know they're on that section

204
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:53,427
right now." And the group you
talked about, I started with

205
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:59,427
another classmate. Her name's
Sherry Martin. And she

206
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:04,677
came to me with these-- this
idea. We called it co-talk,

207
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:11,861
cuz she said she talk to someone
about-- at their bootcamp,

208
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:15,896
they had-- took turns presenting
code, and talking

209
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:19,931
about

210
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:25,572
it, and using technical terms
talking about it, and how she

211
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:27,927
thought that was so cool, and,
like, helpful. And she wanted

212
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:30,282
someone

213
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:38,351
to help her start this. And she,
actually, left Flatiron

214
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:43,812
early for a job. She's just like
woman on a mission, could not

215
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:50,772
stop her. And so, we would do a
technical challenges. I think it

216
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:58,662
was every week. And then, when I
found people like you, who

217
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:02,006
actually had something to
present, or maybe going to a

218
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:04,990
conference, I will

219
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:07,036
pitch them that, "Hey, do you
wanna practice?" And I do

220
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,071
remember--

221
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:18,511
your talk ... being, like, good.
And it was, like, you said of

222
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,911
relaxed, like, ditching it,
like, "Hey, yeah. Just practice

223
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:23,191
here.

224
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:25,937
We'll record it so you can watch
it back, and see how you did."

225
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:28,682
And I

226
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:32,742
remember you saying to me, "I
realize that I need to read off

227
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:36,802
a script.

228
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:41,076
So that's what I did for the
actual conference. And it went

229
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:44,811
so much

230
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:48,366
better." And I was, like, super
happy that, like, you practicing

231
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:51,891
in front

232
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:56,991
of people helped- helped you to
figure that out before the big

233
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:57,532
day [chuckles].

234
00:13:58,466 --> 00:13:59,921
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. I mean,
so many people were like, "Oh,

235
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:01,376
no. You

236
00:14:01,376 --> 00:14:02,786
don't read off of-- like, you
shouldn't read off of anything

237
00:14:02,786 --> 00:14:05,531
or, like, have notes. Like, you
should be able to do it." I

238
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:06,865
can't do

239
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:10,136
that. Like, my memory does not
work that way. I have to have

240
00:14:10,136 --> 00:14:12,236
something in front of me. I
distract myself all the time, or

241
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:14,336
I

242
00:14:14,346 --> 00:14:17,907
go off on tangents, or I'll
remember that I meant to say

243
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:20,237
this thing five minutes ago, and
now like, "What am I supposed

244
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:22,567
to do? Do I

245
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:26,151
go back to that point
[chuckles]?" But-- so, it was-

246
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:29,735
it was really, really helpful
to,

247
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:32,000
like, have that experience.

248
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Meg: Thanks. Nice to know.

249
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,095
Bekah: And I- I mean, I feel
like you've done lot of that

250
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:38,190
throughout all of the stuff that
you're doing. And that-- like,

251
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,285
at Virtual

252
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:41,621
Coffee now, you know? You-
you've come on it-- you have,

253
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:42,955
like, a

254
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:47,216
really great knack for knowing
people. I- I love that you said

255
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:49,166
that you set limits back then.
Because one, I think that's

256
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,116
really good and

257
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:53,306
really important because it
couldn't be easy to-- like, to

258
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:55,917
help everybody all the time.

259
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:57,121
Meg: Oh my god. Yes [chuckles].

260
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:00,621
Bekah: And-- but- but, like, you
have these connections too,

261
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:03,381
like you knew, "Okay. I

262
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:05,781
can't do this, but I can connect
you with other people." And I

263
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:08,181
think that's so great

264
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:10,432
because you're- you're able to
help so many more people, and,

265
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:12,682
like,

266
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:18,261
hopefully preserve your- your
own self from falling into total

267
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,061
exhaustion by creating
boundaries. But also, like,

268
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:23,932
showing that it's okay to have
boundaries with things.

269
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:28,321
Meg: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think, like
I say in the beginning with-

270
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:31,311
with all the

271
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:36,771
work and just, like, pushing
through, like you said, it's--

272
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:41,391
it- it wasn't, like ... Flatiron
didn't do a great job of

273
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:45,980
creating a community for

274
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:51,302
the online self-paced students.
They're just like, "Here's

275
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:59,441
Slack. Here you go." And, so, I
did kind of-- what-- I'm

276
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:05,350
[chuckles]-- I started doing
with

277
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:09,621
the accountability buddies
group, just ... posting

278
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:13,531
incessantly and

279
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:20,912
being so annoying that you have
to be my friend and participate.

280
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:28,782
Like, "Oh my gosh. Okay, fine.
There-- this person's always

281
00:16:28,782 --> 00:16:30,717
posting. I guess I'll go and see
what it's all about." And then

282
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:32,652
it's

283
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:34,602
like, "Oh, they're not a crazy
nut job. And there's other

284
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:36,552
people

285
00:16:36,552 --> 00:16:41,237
here, you know? That-- this is
pretty cool," you know? So ...

286
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:45,922
yeah, I have to

287
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,669
keep a little bit of my crazy
nut job and check when- when

288
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:51,416
people actually

289
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:52,136
show up [Bekah chuckles]. It's
hard [chuckles].

290
00:16:57,256 --> 00:16:58,861
Dan: Can you- can you tell us a
little bit more about, like,

291
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:00,466
the--

292
00:17:00,716 --> 00:17:02,796
about- about the accountability
group itself, and- and, you

293
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:04,876
know, what--

294
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:07,471
sort of what it is, and, you
know, how-- maybe how it

295
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:09,317
started a little bit.

296
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:16,892
Meg: Yeah. Okay. So it was ...
Sarah Strong—who put a post on

297
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:24,037
Slack

298
00:17:24,037 --> 00:17:28,537
somewhere—and ... it was just
asking for an accountability

299
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:33,037
partner

300
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:41,257
when job searching. Because, you
know, it's super fun when you

301
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:48,457
write cover letters, and fill
out applications with, like,

302
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:52,056
your address, and you going--
have to send in your resume, and

303
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:55,655
then type

304
00:17:55,656 --> 00:18:01,626
in everything that's in the f-
attachment you just sent, like,

305
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:04,147
that's all really fun. Also,
getting rejection letters and

306
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:05,977
all

307
00:18:05,977 --> 00:18:13,747
that stuff, super fun. So, you
wanna share the fun with other

308
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:18,306
people, right? I'm being
sarcastic, just in case [Dan

309
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:22,865
chuckles] y'all can't tell
[chuckles]. But--

310
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:27,126
yeah. It's, like, I'm sure a lot
of-- gosh, so many people in

311
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:31,356
tech

312
00:18:31,356 --> 00:18:34,656
now, when looking for a job,
it's- it's a slog. Just, like,

313
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,956
going

314
00:18:37,957 --> 00:18:44,527
through all this and getting in
your inbox, like, "Oh, are you

315
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:50,211
interested in this?" And, like,
another recruiter just shooting

316
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:58,852
out emails to whoever. And it's
nice to have other people

317
00:18:59,392 --> 00:19:07,172
that identify with that, and to
have, just like, a block of time

318
00:19:07,592 --> 00:19:10,546
set aside, "Okay, I'm going to
work towards my goal of getting

319
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:13,500
a

320
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:16,231
job, and this is what I'm gonna
do. And these other people are

321
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:23,031
gonna show up and do the same
thing." And so, her and I, and

322
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:28,971
Aditi ... Green. I'm pretty sure
that's her last name. We

323
00:19:28,971 --> 00:19:31,971
showed up, and it was nice. And
I think we did it two weeks in a

324
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,971
row, and

325
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:41,271
then Sarah couldn't make it. So,
I just kinda kept it going, and

326
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:43,101
took it over, and she's like,
"Oh, no. Yeah, that's great."

327
00:19:43,101 --> 00:19:44,931
Like,

328
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:49,069
"Definitely do that." And a lot
of people who have joined to our

329
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:53,056
job

330
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:58,067
seeking accountabilities group
have since left because

331
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:02,000
they're working during the
meetup time. So-

332
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Bekah: Yeay.

333
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,385
Meg: -yeah, it's pretty awesome.
And ... yeah. Like, people come

334
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:15,770
in, say ... like-- just some

335
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:17,316
people come in, and they're
like, "Ah, it feels like I've

336
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,861
applied for so

337
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:22,661
many, and it's just so many
rejections." And, you know, it's

338
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:26,460
... I

339
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:28,801
feel for them cuz, you know,
I've been there, you- you guys

340
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:31,141
have

341
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:34,622
been there, like-- I just, like,
"Okay. You got this. You- you

342
00:20:34,622 --> 00:20:38,102
can keep

343
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:39,987
going." And I love it when
people just drop in, even if

344
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:41,872
they're not

345
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:53,467
job seeking. A lot of times,
Brett will drop in from

346
00:20:53,467 --> 00:21:00,517
Australia when he's wrapping up
his day on Friday morning-- our

347
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:03,000
Friday morning, his Friday
evening, I guess.

348
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Bekah: That's late.

349
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,876
Meg: Yeah.

350
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:05,047
Bekah: What is the--

351
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:09,386
Meg: It- it's, like, his
family's in bed, and he's just

352
00:21:09,386 --> 00:21:11,636
like, "Oh, yeah. I'm just,

353
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:15,622
you know, want to come, and say
hi, and keep you company while I

354
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:18,862
do this." And--

355
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:24,436
Bekah: When you-- so you ran it
through Zoom, and you have

356
00:21:24,436 --> 00:21:26,386
recently been breaking it into
different rooms, right?

357
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:30,657
Meg: Yeah. Yeah. Because
sometimes we have ... a good

358
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:33,942
amount

359
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:37,299
of people come out, and, you
know, other-- everyone has

360
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:40,656
their own way of

361
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:43,341
working. If someone needs it's
be a little quieter, you know,

362
00:21:43,341 --> 00:21:45,905
like a

363
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,741
breakout room for quiet
co-working or you're just in

364
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,886
that

365
00:21:50,886 --> 00:21:53,121
flow but you have the presence
of another person. Like,

366
00:21:53,121 --> 00:21:55,356
somehow,

367
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,216
that just makes you feel more
accountable. Having someone

368
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,076
there.

369
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:04,269
And then, since this month,
we're doing, like, I don't--

370
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:08,892
like,

371
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:13,001
job-search-type monthly
challenge. I've been adding

372
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:16,931
breakout

373
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:23,442
rooms for people who want resume
reviews or who are working on

374
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:32,082
their cover letters. If they
have anything specific and

375
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:36,721
got their resume reviewed, say,
they can meet with whoever

376
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:39,891
reviewed it in a

377
00:22:39,922 --> 00:22:46,491
breakout room. And I guess I'll
be adding different one soon.

378
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:52,192
The elevator pitch room and
portfolio ... stuff room.

379
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:54,561
Bekah: Yeah. The second half--
well, that starts today. I- I

380
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,121
was off today,

381
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:58,491
so I keep forgetting it's
Monday.

382
00:23:00,561 --> 00:23:02,961
Meg: What [chuckles]? I think I
worked today. Can't be Monday.

383
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:04,466
Bekah: I mean, my kids are home.
Like, my kids have been home

384
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,500
since

385
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:07,241
last Wednesday. So, all the
sense of time is, like, it's-

386
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:08,741
it's

387
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:09,041
gone. Like [laughs]--

388
00:23:09,646 --> 00:23:12,227
Meg: You're slackers. You need
to be back in school [chuckles].

389
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:15,579
Bekah: Right? I know [chuckles].
I love it. Having that

390
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:18,516
accountability does

391
00:23:18,517 --> 00:23:22,807
make a huge difference. Because
sometimes it just seems so hard.

392
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:24,471
Like, you don't wanna do it one
more time, you don't want one

393
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:28,311
more rejection, you're tired of
writing cover letters. But

394
00:23:28,311 --> 00:23:30,486
knowing that

395
00:23:30,487 --> 00:23:32,916
there's somebody else there
seems to make it- it- it feels

396
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:36,696
easier when you have that
accountability.

397
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,676
Meg: Mm-hmm. Yeah. And
sometimes, you need to just vent

398
00:23:39,676 --> 00:23:41,811
to other people who

399
00:23:41,842 --> 00:23:47,122
get it or celebrate with other
people. Like, "Oh my god, I just

400
00:23:47,122 --> 00:23:51,081
got an interview," or, "I just
got this rejection email right

401
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:55,040
now."

402
00:23:55,162 --> 00:24:03,221
And, you know, either one, you
gonna get- you gonna get re-

403
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:11,761
supportive response for either
event, just from Virtual Coffee

404
00:24:11,761 --> 00:24:18,751
in general. But you're in the
accountability buddies session.

405
00:24:20,102 --> 00:24:22,546
Yeah, you can definitely find
what you need there. What are

406
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:25,422
you looking around there
[chuckles]?

407
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,606
Bekah: There- there is, like,
something-- there's some noise

408
00:24:28,606 --> 00:24:31,876
happening in my room-- on the
other side of the room. But we

409
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:34,351
don't have animals and none of
my children are in here. So,

410
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:36,826
like, my

411
00:24:36,826 --> 00:24:38,476
12-years-old convinced that
there's a ghost in our house

412
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,126
because he

413
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:41,686
heard a splash in his closet one
night, and then there was all

414
00:24:41,686 --> 00:24:43,246
this water on

415
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:45,257
the floor, okay? But it didn't
drip from it and from anywhere.

416
00:24:45,257 --> 00:24:48,956
There wasn't a glass or anything
there. I-- like, literally, I

417
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:50,645
was like, "I

418
00:24:50,646 --> 00:24:52,011
wonder if that was a pregnant
mouse and its water broke." And

419
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:53,376
then I

420
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:56,826
was like, "That's too much water
for a pregnant mouse," I think.

421
00:24:57,457 --> 00:24:57,936
Anyway ... so [chuckles]--

422
00:24:59,182 --> 00:25:02,291
Meg: Wait. Your 12-year-old came
up with a pregnant mouse?

423
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:04,626
Bekah: No, that was me. I came
up with a pregnant mouse. He

424
00:25:04,626 --> 00:25:06,277
thought it was a ghost. So
[chuckles]--

425
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Dan: Oh my god [chuckles].

426
00:25:10,352 --> 00:25:14,432
Meg: I thought he thought it was
the ghost of a pregnant mouse.

427
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:17,146
Bekah: Well, that's even better
[Meg chuckles]. But we didn't

428
00:25:17,146 --> 00:25:21,247
find any mice babies ... either.

429
00:25:21,412 --> 00:25:25,706
Meg: Oh. Yeah. That's-- let's
... not touch that one for now.

430
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:30,000
Leaving it.

431
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Bekah: [Laughs] Would you that
[??]?

432
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,600
Meg: Oh, what if you open the
door at the closet, and Gritty

433
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,981
would staring out at you?

434
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:43,007
Bekah: That would be super
freaky.

435
00:25:43,521 --> 00:25:44,082
Meg: Yeah, right?

436
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:47,332
Bekah: What if it the ghost of
Gritty with the ghost of the

437
00:25:47,332 --> 00:25:47,961
pregnant mouse?

438
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:51,182
Dan: Oh my god [chuckles].

439
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,000
Meg: But Gritty's still alive.

440
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Bekah: Mm.

441
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Meg: He can never die.

442
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,535
Bekah: Well, also, I think the
mouse would probably not be

443
00:25:56,535 --> 00:25:58,070
pregnant anymore

444
00:25:58,071 --> 00:25:59,535
if her water broke. So, the
ghost of the once pregnant

445
00:25:59,535 --> 00:26:00,999
mouse-

446
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Dan: That's [chuckles]--

447
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Bekah: -be held by real-life
Gritty.

448
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Dan: This is- this is going down
real fast [laughs].

449
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,718
Bekah: Told you I'm not
responsible [chuckles] ... for

450
00:26:11,718 --> 00:26:14,436
my brain at this time of night.

451
00:26:14,436 --> 00:26:16,201
Dan: Oh, man.

452
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:19,641
Meg: Can I just mention that ...
we're mentioning Gritty ... this

453
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:23,081
is the

454
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:30,096
8th time. Because it was a
request from Party Tom for this

455
00:26:30,096 --> 00:26:33,767
episode. And Party Tom gets what
Party Tom wants [chuckles].

456
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:34,707
Dan: That's right.

457
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:35,196
Bekah: That's right.

458
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:41,303
Dan: So ... Gritty [all laughs].
We, you know, Meg-- I- I forget

459
00:26:41,303 --> 00:26:45,770
if we said this on the recording

460
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,541
or not, but Meg asked on Slack
for questions, you know, for-

461
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,311
for

462
00:26:49,311 --> 00:26:54,321
her-- for- for this- for this
podcast episode. And there was a

463
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,811
lot of good questions, but lot
of them were about Philly cuz

464
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:59,941
Meg is from Philly. And, you
know, Philly is pretty ...

465
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:02,601
unique, you

466
00:27:02,602 --> 00:27:03,757
know? I don't know. And- and-
and awesome, but yeah. You

467
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:04,912
know--

468
00:27:04,912 --> 00:27:06,199
Meg: You mean, use
[unintelligible] alone a great

469
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:07,486
question. You're bouncing [??]--

470
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,991
Dan: I- I have-- and- and, you
know, I-- we've-- Meg and I

471
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:14,271
have talked

472
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:15,861
about this, but I- I work with
some- some people from Philly.

473
00:27:15,861 --> 00:27:17,451
The- the

474
00:27:17,451 --> 00:27:21,261
other side of Sprokets is- is
based in Philly. And so, I get

475
00:27:21,261 --> 00:27:23,692
a little bit of Philly culture
just from that. And one of the

476
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:27,832
favorite words that I've ever
learned is the word 'jawn'.

477
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:29,931
And I'm sure I'm not saying it
well, because I'm, you know,

478
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:31,490
from Cleveland-

479
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:32,000
Meg: No. You got it.

480
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:33,899
Dan: -and not Philly. But can
you- can you just-- well, I

481
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:36,307
suppose you'll have to

482
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:37,000
spell it for our listeners, and
then-

483
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Meg: Yes.

484
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,768
Dan: -can- can you just sort of
define it, and then maybe use it

485
00:27:40,768 --> 00:27:43,536
in a sentence or two? Just as a-

486
00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:44,946
as a- as a native, you know? I
always try to explain it to

487
00:27:44,946 --> 00:27:46,345
people, but I-- it-

488
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:48,331
it feels, you know, it does-- it
feel-- it doesn't feel

489
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:50,165
right, me

490
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:52,186
talking about it, you know? So
[Meg chuckles], can you- can

491
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:54,206
you-- yeah. Can you-- can-- lay
on

492
00:27:54,207 --> 00:27:55,656
some- some Philly knowledge for
us?

493
00:27:56,622 --> 00:28:01,921
Meg: Yes. Jawn is spelled
J.A.W.N. It has nothing to do

494
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:07,220
with sex

495
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:11,110
work. That's the first thing
that people think of when they

496
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,999
hear that word. And--

497
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Dan: Is this [laughs]--

498
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Bekah: No! What [laughs]?

499
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Dan: This is [laughs]--

500
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,245
Meg: I- I've got in that
reaction pretty much every time

501
00:28:26,245 --> 00:28:31,490
that word comes up. [Chuckles]
So,

502
00:28:32,192 --> 00:28:37,994
jawn is ... just in place of a
thing. It's a thing. It ca- it

503
00:28:37,994 --> 00:28:43,796
can be used as,

504
00:28:43,797 --> 00:28:50,757
like, a noun, or adjective, or
adverb ... maybe a verb, I'm not

505
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:51,297
sure.

506
00:28:51,862 --> 00:28:52,431
Dan: I mean, that's- that's one
of the things I love the most

507
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:53,000
about it-

508
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Bekah: Jawn it.

509
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Dan: -is its utility.

510
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Meg: Yeah.

511
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Dan: So, can you--

512
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,806
Bekah: I still don't understand
what it means though. Like,

513
00:28:58,806 --> 00:29:00,612
[laughs] I- I need more than
that.

514
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Dan: Can- can--

515
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:02,876
Meg: It's a thing. Like,
something.

516
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:05,000
Dan: Can you just, like-- can
you just use it?

517
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Bekah: Can you use it in a
sentence?

518
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Dan: Yeah-yeah-yeah. To--

519
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:12,818
Meg: Okay. Like ... okay. For
instance, today, Nerando was

520
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:17,385
ragging on Kirk

521
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:24,317
for his hair being too long and
saying, "You need a haircut."

522
00:29:24,317 --> 00:29:27,057
Someone from Philly would say,
"Yo, cut that jawn."

523
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:35,021
Dan: [Laughs] Yeah-yeah. Or a
... alright. I'm gonna try it

524
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:37,416
out. But you tell

525
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:39,131
me if it's wrong. It's-- you
know, but-- like ... alright.

526
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:40,836
So today,

527
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:45,816
I was writing some React, you
know, stuff. And then I needed

528
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,886
to save some states. So I used
that useState jawn.

529
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:48,902
Meg: Yeah. There you go.

530
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:51,397
Dan: Is that alright? Yeah.
That's easy. I can do it, see?

531
00:29:51,397 --> 00:29:52,882
I- I have a

532
00:29:52,882 --> 00:29:53,971
little Philly-- yeah. As I was
saying, I worked for-- with

533
00:29:53,971 --> 00:29:56,000
some [crosstalk] Philly, so I
get a little exposure.

534
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Meg: I mean, you were knighted.

535
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Dan: That's right-

536
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Meg: By the power vested in me
by Philly [??]--

537
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,405
Dan: -Meg knighted me because I-
I translated a Philly- Philly

538
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:03,201
billboard. I only got one thing
wrong [laughs].

539
00:30:04,656 --> 00:30:06,277
Meg: Yeah, like [unintelligible]
semantic--

540
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:08,547
Bekah: So it's- it's a
placeholder word.

541
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:10,371
Dan: Yeah, yeah. It- it's
[crosstalk] a word that you

542
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:11,001
can--

543
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,208
Bekah: It's like if you don't
know-- like a 'thingamabobber'

544
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:15,747
or 'whatchamacallit', that can
be a jawn.

545
00:30:15,866 --> 00:30:16,406
Meg: Yeah.

546
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:17,521
Dan: [Chuckles] Right. Right. If
you're not from the 40s

547
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:18,271
[laughs].

548
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:22,546
Meg: It's a full versioning of
'thingamabobber', 'doodad',

549
00:30:22,546 --> 00:30:25,325
'whatchamacallit', a
'whozitwhatzit' [laughs].

550
00:30:26,054 --> 00:30:28,169
Bekah: Alright, there we go. I
get-- I've got it now. Thank

551
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:30,284
you.

552
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:35,591
Dan: [Chuckles] That's awesome.
Thank you for that. Thank you

553
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:38,142
for kind of laying that down for
us.

554
00:30:39,355 --> 00:30:42,677
Bekah: So, we have now covered
Philly things. And you are still

555
00:30:42,677 --> 00:30:45,999
in Philly-

556
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Meg: Yeah.

557
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,867
Bekah: -and you've talked about
other things that you've done in

558
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:55,734
the past as-- with-- you- you
had

559
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:57,867
an animal ... what business?
[Crosstalk] Why-- you watched

560
00:30:57,867 --> 00:31:00,000
animals?

561
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Meg: Oh. Pet sitting business.

562
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Bekah: Okay.

563
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Meg: Yeah.

564
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,529
Bekah: And you have a Spanish
degree. So, how- how of these

565
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:12,058
past experiences play into ...
what you're doing now?

566
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:21,769
Meg: That's a great question.
They make for ... interesting

567
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:27,037
stories [Bekah chuckles]. That's
one. For Spanish, it does come

568
00:31:27,037 --> 00:31:32,305
up in

569
00:31:32,305 --> 00:31:42,805
translation, sometimes in, like,
working. And there's a lot of

570
00:31:42,805 --> 00:31:44,664
Spanish speakers in my area.

571
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:50,150
Bekah: I mentioned to learning a
different language when you're

572
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,490
learning to code, it-- there's--
it's similar, right? There's

573
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,569
overlap in how you learn and
retain that knowledge.

574
00:31:57,305 --> 00:32:02,149
Meg: Yeah, I- I ... am pretty
sure that I wrote a blog post

575
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:06,993
about ... yeah.

576
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:10,545
There's-- I've wrote blog post
about, like, learning Spanish,

577
00:32:10,545 --> 00:32:14,065
and

578
00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:19,824
learning code, and how that was,
like, similar. It's my "Little

579
00:32:19,824 --> 00:32:25,194
Things Matter" blog posts.

580
00:32:25,724 --> 00:32:26,204
Bekah: Oh, I see it. Not enough
[??]--

581
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:31,629
Meg: Yeah. So, like, very small
things like, "Hey, I- I forgot a

582
00:32:31,629 --> 00:32:36,233
colon—or

583
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:46,674
whatever in coding ... makes
stuff fail. And in Spanish,

584
00:32:47,244 --> 00:32:52,555
stressing the wrong syllable or,
like, pronouncing, like,

585
00:32:52,674 --> 00:32:53,934
pronunciation --"

586
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:56,014
Bekah: Did I tell you my story
about Spanish, and sleeping, and

587
00:32:56,014 --> 00:32:57,979
married before?

588
00:32:59,285 --> 00:33:02,825
Meg: Yeah. Co- cuz ... oh, I--

589
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:05,505
Bekah: No, I was tired.

590
00:33:05,555 --> 00:33:08,045
Meg: Yeah, you did. You did tell
me. But I think you should tell

591
00:33:08,045 --> 00:33:10,865
it again.

592
00:33:12,295 --> 00:33:14,170
Bekah: When I was, maybe 19, I
went to language school in Costa

593
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:19,464
Rica by myself. And then, I had
to take a taxi home-- or to the

594
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,883
airport. And the

595
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:28,163
cab driver-- okay. So, though
there's 'cansado' and 'casado',

596
00:33:28,164 --> 00:33:30,711
one means tired, right, and one
means married. And so I thought

597
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:33,258
that

598
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:38,150
he asked me if I was tired, and
I said a little bit. But he was

599
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,084
really asking me if I was
married [Dan chuckles]. And so I

600
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,018
told him little

601
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:44,194
bit. And then he asked me if he
could hold my hand. And then I

602
00:33:44,194 --> 00:33:46,369
was afraid he

603
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:48,592
was going to kill me. So I held
his hand for the [chuckles] 40

604
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:50,815
minute ride to the

605
00:33:50,815 --> 00:33:52,690
airport. So I- I highly
recommend not telling anybody

606
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,565
that you're a

607
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:58,974
little bit married. Just- just
go- go-- you can be fully

608
00:33:58,974 --> 00:34:01,067
married or fully tired, but
don't hold that hand of a taxi

609
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:03,595
driver in Costa Rica [laughs].

610
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:06,889
Dan: Yeah, a little bit seems
like-- probably the absolute

611
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:09,289
worst answer to that question
[chuckles].

612
00:34:10,164 --> 00:34:11,905
Bekah: Yeah. Well, I thought I
was tired, so--

613
00:34:12,005 --> 00:34:15,664
Meg: Can I ask you which one's,
which?

614
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,260
Bekah: I don't remember, Meg
[Bekah and Meg laugh].

615
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Dan: Lesson learned [chuckles].

616
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Bekah: I'm not gonna use it at
all cost.

617
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,714
Meg: [Laughs] I'm gonna just let
you not know, because I want you

618
00:34:25,714 --> 00:34:29,269
to make that same mistake again.

619
00:34:32,518 --> 00:34:33,778
Bekah: Oh, no [chuckles]. Okay.
Sorry. I've gotten us off on a

620
00:34:33,778 --> 00:34:35,038
tangent again.

621
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,393
Oh, oh, okay. I know what I
wanted to ask. So we both went

622
00:34:37,393 --> 00:34:39,328
to Flatiron,

623
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:41,399
it's a full-stack bootcamp,
right? And I know, for me, I

624
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,469
really enjoyed learning

625
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,133
Ruby and Rails. And I was like,
"I'm definitely going to be a

626
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:48,018
Rails

627
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:51,498
developer," which I was not
[laughs]. I went to-- somebody

628
00:34:51,498 --> 00:34:54,408
hired me. I

629
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:56,794
don't know why. And then I
worked on React projects

630
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,179
[chuckles], which I thought was

631
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:03,768
never gonna happen. You have
stuck with Ruby [Bekah and Dan

632
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:08,357
laugh]. And how

633
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:10,973
did- how did that-- how did you
... stick with it? Did you feel

634
00:35:10,973 --> 00:35:13,588
that

635
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:16,273
way, or did you wanna stick with
Ruby, or were you like, "Where-

636
00:35:16,273 --> 00:35:18,958
where I find a job," or, you

637
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:23,099
know, what- what-- how did you
make that decision?

638
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:30,883
Meg: I ... I think [silence]
[exhales] you never forget your

639
00:35:30,883 --> 00:35:37,368
first ... [Bekah and Dan
chuckle] you know [chuckles]?

640
00:35:41,528 --> 00:35:46,958
Yeah, I really- I really fell in
love with Ruby. And in

641
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:54,849
Flatiron, the order that they
taught us—which now is

642
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:06,248
flip-flopped—they did Ruby
first, and then Sinatra, and

643
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:11,588
Rails frameworks, and then
JavaScript with React and Redux

644
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:16,755
frameworks. And I think that I
was able to-- I took a longer

645
00:36:16,755 --> 00:36:21,922
time

646
00:36:21,954 --> 00:36:27,324
going through Ruby, Sinatra, and
Rails. So it allowed me to get,

647
00:36:27,324 --> 00:36:33,143
like, a really good appreciation
for the language. And also, a

648
00:36:33,143 --> 00:36:36,878
friend of mine from Flatiron,
Heather Miller—she's down in

649
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:40,613
DC—she

650
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:46,844
invited me to this conference
called Ruby for Good.

651
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:51,548
And that's when I just started
Rails. Both of us. And it was,

652
00:36:51,548 --> 00:36:55,207
like, the

653
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:58,193
people there were so nice. It
was-- I think three days,

654
00:36:58,193 --> 00:37:01,178
everyone

655
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:04,613
was so nice and friendly. We're
making-- we were working on

656
00:37:04,613 --> 00:37:08,047
apps

657
00:37:08,048 --> 00:37:14,949
for social good, to do things
for people. And I knew next to

658
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:18,316
nothing, but people were still
like, "Oh, you can- you can

659
00:37:18,316 --> 00:37:21,683
totally help. You can

660
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,429
definitely be, you know, a
contributing member of our

661
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:26,994
team."

662
00:37:27,864 --> 00:37:31,163
And it-- that made me really
fall in love with the Ruby

663
00:37:31,163 --> 00:37:34,462
community.

664
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:44,923
And I found that that's a very
... universal mindset of the

665
00:37:44,923 --> 00:37:47,673
Ruby community. The people are
very, very nice, and welcoming,

666
00:37:47,673 --> 00:37:50,423
and

667
00:37:50,423 --> 00:37:56,664
willing to teach. And similarly,
that's how the Philly tech

668
00:37:56,693 --> 00:38:04,583
community has been in my
personal experience. Before the

669
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:11,393
pandemic, I was networking a lot
in person, and found a lot of

670
00:38:12,684 --> 00:38:23,199
people very welcoming, and open,
like, to, you know, a woman in

671
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:27,798
tech, and someone from, like, a
nontraditional path. And

672
00:38:27,798 --> 00:38:32,397
Philly's definitely a

673
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:38,053
colorful city, like, in
different-- in ways of

674
00:38:38,053 --> 00:38:42,478
diversity, and

675
00:38:42,478 --> 00:38:48,543
it's blending- it's blending
into the tech community heavily.

676
00:38:48,664 --> 00:38:56,474
And I think ... that makes it
very welcoming. And I saw just

677
00:38:56,474 --> 00:38:59,353
both of those in the Ruby
community and Philly tech

678
00:38:59,353 --> 00:39:04,844
community. The- the issue was,
there- there weren't-- there

679
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:13,539
wasn't a lot of Ruby on Rails in
Philly at the time. So I was

680
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:17,588
just like, "Oh, no." So I was
ready to get a job's doing

681
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:20,558
anything. But then, once the
pandemic happened, like, a

682
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:23,528
silver

683
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:29,139
lining of that was remote work.
Now the world is my oyster. I

684
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:32,859
could get a Rails job for
anywhere, just working from my

685
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:36,579
desk at

686
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:41,409
home. So that definitely- that
definitely helped with my

687
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:47,767
job search, having, like, that
focus on Rails jobs. Like, this

688
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:50,903
is what I love, this is what I
wanna do. And, especially,

689
00:39:50,903 --> 00:39:54,038
having

690
00:39:54,039 --> 00:40:02,318
like- like now, I'm on the core
team of Ruby for Good. And I

691
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:06,373
enjoy-- I really enjoy doing
that, and work that's

692
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:10,428
meaningful, and

693
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:19,369
fulfilling, and that it helps
people. So that was like

694
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:21,423
something that I really
would've, like, to do as well.

695
00:40:21,423 --> 00:40:23,477
And I was targeting

696
00:40:23,478 --> 00:40:28,759
companies like that, that were
Rails companies as well.

697
00:40:31,403 --> 00:40:33,458
Dan: Is the-- so your position
with Ruby for Good is a

698
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,513
volunteer ... [crosstalk]
position, right?

699
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Meg: Yeah. Yeah.

700
00:40:36,054 --> 00:40:37,764
Dan: As-- I- I was pretty sure
that-- is- is that-- so, can

701
00:40:37,764 --> 00:40:39,474
you talk a little bit more

702
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:41,963
about, like, what you- what you
all do as an organization? I

703
00:40:41,963 --> 00:40:44,273
think you- I

704
00:40:44,273 --> 00:40:46,224
think you talked a little bit
about their conference, but, you

705
00:40:46,224 --> 00:40:48,083
know, can you just kinda explain
Ruby for Good as a, you know, as

706
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:50,784
a-- as an organization and--

707
00:40:52,373 --> 00:40:56,243
Meg: You're saying-- yeah. Ruby
for Good is a nonprofit and

708
00:40:56,243 --> 00:41:00,113
it's volunteer led.

709
00:41:00,233 --> 00:41:10,164
Sean Marcia is the founder, and
it's largely-- it's- it's based

710
00:41:10,164 --> 00:41:16,974
in DC. So the membership is
largely in DC. But definitely

711
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,859
expanding. And basically, it's
uses something called

712
00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:24,744
skills-based

713
00:41:24,744 --> 00:41:30,728
volunteering, which is people in
the tech community use their

714
00:41:31,028 --> 00:41:36,849
specialized set of skills, like
Liam Neeson. But they do good

715
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:41,558
things to them [chuckles]. They
build software for other

716
00:41:41,558 --> 00:41:46,267
nonprofits,

717
00:41:46,449 --> 00:41:55,994
and-- so that might be like a
website, or a sign-up form, or,

718
00:41:56,833 --> 00:42:05,353
like, an actual software system.
Something that it-- like, are

719
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:08,263
probably-- I think is the oldest
project—and probably the

720
00:42:08,263 --> 00:42:10,213
biggest—is

721
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:17,054
called Human Essentials. It was
rebranded from Diaper Based,

722
00:42:17,804 --> 00:42:26,143
and it had started out as ...
inventory management system for

723
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:30,838
Diaper Banks, and ... it- it
started like that. And then, it

724
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:35,503
grew because

725
00:42:35,534 --> 00:42:37,994
they're like, "Okay, this
awesome." Now look at-- the

726
00:42:37,994 --> 00:42:40,454
Diaper Banks are

727
00:42:40,454 --> 00:42:42,298
receiving these products,
they're giving the products to

728
00:42:42,298 --> 00:42:44,142
their partners,

729
00:42:44,143 --> 00:42:49,844
like churches, and food
pantries, and homeless shelters

730
00:42:49,873 --> 00:42:56,083
who then to-- distribute the
products to families. So they

731
00:42:56,083 --> 00:43:01,873
wanted a way to-- for their
partners to track what was

732
00:43:01,873 --> 00:43:04,918
needed, and who got stuff. So
they made Partner Base to go

733
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,963
along

734
00:43:08,684 --> 00:43:11,008
with Diaper Base. Then it's
like, "Okay. Well, these items

735
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:13,332
aren't

736
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:18,248
just diapers. They're also
feminine care products, soaps,

737
00:43:18,268 --> 00:43:22,483
creams, like shampoos, things
like that." So, they kind of

738
00:43:22,483 --> 00:43:26,698
merged

739
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:34,469
both of 'em together, and called
it Human Essentials in-- and

740
00:43:35,128 --> 00:43:39,000
serving almost 200 Diaper Banks
right now. But then-

741
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Dan: That's ... really cool.

742
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,142
Meg: -there's also stuff, like,
there's a- a lending library in

743
00:43:46,142 --> 00:43:52,284
Chicago, that-- it's a
circulation system

744
00:43:52,373 --> 00:43:57,079
for, like, tools and other types
of equipment for this lending

745
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:01,785
library. And CASA—Court

746
00:44:02,126 --> 00:44:07,139
Appointed Advocate-- let me look
it up real quicks. I

747
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:08,340
don't want to--

748
00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:08,949
Dan: A special advocate-- court-
court of-- Court

749
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:09,429
Appointed Special Advocate.

750
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,539
Meg: Yeah. Court Appointed
Special Advocate.

751
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:13,239
Dan: Like, I google from there
[??] [chuckles].

752
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:22,179
Meg: And that's just a system to
track volunteer time. So it-

753
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:26,167
it ranges for different needs,
and it's-- it feels like it's

754
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:29,795
all open source

755
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:34,385
contribution. So people can get
involved with just one

756
00:44:34,385 --> 00:44:40,175
project, do it, like, one or two
pull requests and be done, or

757
00:44:40,175 --> 00:44:46,864
they can get involved heavily.
And these projects have, like,

758
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:50,224
weekly office hours, and
stakeholder meetings, and

759
00:44:50,224 --> 00:44:52,804
things.

760
00:44:53,885 --> 00:44:56,252
And ... yeah. It's something
that really spoke to me. And

761
00:44:56,252 --> 00:44:58,619
I'm- I'm

762
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:03,210
a very organized person by
nature since I used to work

763
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:10,019
as an admin. So I- I told Sean,
I was like, "Yeah. Let me- let

764
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:12,764
me help out however I can
[giggles]." So, he's like,

765
00:45:12,764 --> 00:45:15,989
"Yeah, [crosstalk] let's do
this. Come on."

766
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,900
Dan: Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah,
I'm sure. No, that's really

767
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,800
great. It- it seems

768
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,249
like really interesting
organization. That- that sort of

769
00:45:25,249 --> 00:45:28,698
thing, I always wonder ... so
you

770
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:36,050
make a product for another
nonprofit, right? Does Ruby

771
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,019
for Good end up maintaining that
over time, or- or is it, like, a

772
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:41,044
sort of a handoff kind of thing,
or ... you know? This is just of

773
00:45:41,044 --> 00:45:43,069
me-- my curiosity.

774
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:44,719
I've always been curious about
it [chuckles].

775
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:52,244
Meg: Yeah. I think ... I think
it depends. I want--

776
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:55,739
Dan: Yeah. I mean, I suppose--
oh, go ahead.

777
00:45:56,925 --> 00:46:00,074
Meg: There's many where we
maintain it, and there's some

778
00:46:00,074 --> 00:46:03,223
that that's

779
00:46:03,224 --> 00:46:06,254
just kind of a one and done
thing. Like, some-- it's ... I

780
00:46:06,254 --> 00:46:09,284
need

781
00:46:09,465 --> 00:46:16,264
something that does A, B and C.
And once it's done, they use it.

782
00:46:17,434 --> 00:46:19,504
They're like, "Oh, can you
change this and that?" "Okay."

783
00:46:19,504 --> 00:46:21,574
And then

784
00:46:21,574 --> 00:46:23,209
they're like, "Awesome. Thank
you so much. Now we don't have

785
00:46:23,209 --> 00:46:24,844
to go

786
00:46:24,844 --> 00:46:27,454
and buy this stuff." And they
can use their money on other

787
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:30,064
stuff that

788
00:46:30,065 --> 00:46:33,845
they need. And they don't need,
like, updates and stuff like

789
00:46:33,845 --> 00:46:37,625
that.

790
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:42,704
Cuz it's not like-- these other
nonprofits are full of

791
00:46:43,655 --> 00:46:46,894
volunteers. Like, they may have
a few employees depending on the

792
00:46:46,894 --> 00:46:50,449
nonprofit, but the goal is to
just spread help to other

793
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:54,004
people,

794
00:46:54,954 --> 00:46:58,894
and especially the organizations
that don't have vast resources.

795
00:46:59,405 --> 00:47:01,354
Dan: Oh, that's- that's cool.
And- and so, they- they do a lot

796
00:47:01,354 --> 00:47:03,303
of their

797
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:07,039
projects, sort of open source
too, right?

798
00:47:07,164 --> 00:47:08,934
Meg: Yeah. Yep. Like,
everything--

799
00:47:09,699 --> 00:47:11,289
Dan: Is it all of them, or is
there-- are there some--

800
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,849
everything? Yeah. That's so
cool.

801
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,860
Meg: Yeah. So you can just go on
GitHub, and go in there, and

802
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,260
check it out. And
[unintelligible]--

803
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,575
Dan: Yeah. Anybody who's
listening to this can go or

804
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,420
contribute, right? I think

805
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,460
that's so cool. That's such a
cool organization.

806
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:29,189
Meg: It- it makes stuff like
that, like-- well, I guess we

807
00:47:29,189 --> 00:47:33,509
jazzed up about

808
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:38,857
open source. Just ... you know
how when you-- if you toss a

809
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:43,425
rock into

810
00:47:43,425 --> 00:47:47,235
a calm, cold water in the
ripples go out? It's-- that's

811
00:47:47,235 --> 00:47:51,045
how I view open source.

812
00:47:51,045 --> 00:48:00,195
Like, you can make a change on
some code in that, and

813
00:48:00,195 --> 00:48:06,224
it spreads from there. Whoever
forks that repository gets your

814
00:48:06,224 --> 00:48:13,320
change. Whoever uses the
software gets your change. And

815
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:22,920
it's spreads however far this
piece of software goes. And you-

816
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:30,119
you just don't know when you
start. Like, there's that badge

817
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:34,004
on GitHub—the Mars Rover badge.
Like, so many people contributed

818
00:48:34,004 --> 00:48:37,139
to code

819
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:43,860
that put a robot on Mars, and
didn't know until they got that

820
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:49,065
badge. And

821
00:48:49,065 --> 00:48:52,364
it's ... like, you can say that
like, "Oh yeah, you know, I

822
00:48:52,364 --> 00:48:55,663
wrote some

823
00:48:55,664 --> 00:48:56,369
code for the Mars Rover," like,
"No big [exhales]." [Bekah and

824
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:57,074
Dan chuckle] So--

825
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:06,366
Bekah: Yeah. I love that. I- I
was just talking to someone ...

826
00:49:06,366 --> 00:49:08,363
last week,

827
00:49:08,423 --> 00:49:10,973
about Hacktoberfest, and that
happens in October [Meg

828
00:49:10,973 --> 00:49:13,523
giggles]. But I'm, like, already

829
00:49:13,554 --> 00:49:16,643
getting super excited for that.
Cuz it's-- I dunno. It's, like--

830
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:19,793
it's great to do as part of
Virtual Coffee and see people

831
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:23,784
contributing. But there's--
there are so many good

832
00:49:24,054 --> 00:49:28,043
projects out there that people
can contribute to, and figuring

833
00:49:28,043 --> 00:49:29,468
out ... I don't know-- the best
way to put people in touch with

834
00:49:29,468 --> 00:49:30,893
them

835
00:49:30,893 --> 00:49:32,663
cuz it can be overwhelming
getting into open source. But,

836
00:49:32,663 --> 00:49:34,433
like, making

837
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:39,579
that easily accessible is- is a-
a goal for this year, for sure.

838
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:42,598
Meg: Yeah. Same. I'm trying to
do that with the Ruby for Good

839
00:49:42,598 --> 00:49:44,628
website,

840
00:49:45,228 --> 00:49:54,559
trying to clean it. It's a-- I
have a 3000 line style sheet to

841
00:49:54,588 --> 00:49:59,423
clean up be-before HacktoberFest
kicks off. Also, my

842
00:49:59,423 --> 00:50:04,258
Hacktoberfest

843
00:50:04,278 --> 00:50:09,259
challenge from last year to
Virtual Coffee went woefully

844
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:10,248
unanswered.

845
00:50:10,686 --> 00:50:11,646
Bekah: What was your challenge?

846
00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:11,646
Dan: Uh-oh.

847
00:50:12,856 --> 00:50:14,085
Meg: Dan remembers, right?

848
00:50:15,751 --> 00:50:16,590
Dan: I'd [chuckles]-- oh, I'm
blanking now.

849
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:20,915
Meg: It-- I said, "For- for
every first time contributor to

850
00:50:20,915 --> 00:50:24,215
make a pull

851
00:50:24,215 --> 00:50:28,150
request in October, I would take
a shot." [Dan laughs] And I only

852
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:34,115
took three shots. The whole
month.

853
00:50:34,351 --> 00:50:35,331
Dan: Well, we--

854
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,130
Bekah: Oh, I think maybe we--
you needed to take 70, okay? So-

855
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:38,721
Dan: Yeah [laughs].

856
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:40,650
Bekah: -pace yourself
[chuckles].

857
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:43,521
Dan: Well ... yeah. That- that
happened because it-- I-- we

858
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:45,501
were so burnt

859
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,075
out from Hacktoberfest that it
took me, like, a month and a

860
00:50:47,075 --> 00:50:48,649
half to

861
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,165
actually pull together any
stats. And by that time, I had-

862
00:50:50,165 --> 00:50:52,490
I had totally forgotten.

863
00:50:53,641 --> 00:50:53,911
Bekah: Yeah. We should-

864
00:50:54,005 --> 00:50:54,545
Dan: Well, we're just gonna have
to redo it. We'll have- we'll

865
00:50:54,545 --> 00:50:55,085
have-

866
00:50:55,141 --> 00:50:55,621
Bekah: -we can fill that in,
this year.

867
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:57,925
Dan: -to redo this year. Yeah.
We'll- we'll do it, Meg.

868
00:50:58,476 --> 00:50:59,976
A Meg shot counter, you know?
We'll- we'll build it so that we

869
00:50:59,976 --> 00:51:01,476
won't- we

870
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:05,270
won't forget [Dan and Meg
chuckle]. I mean, we- we- we

871
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:09,064
have-- well, I'll have to think
of some, you

872
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:10,835
know, stretch goals and stuff
[chuckles]. Because we also

873
00:51:10,835 --> 00:51:12,605
don't want, you

874
00:51:12,606 --> 00:51:16,273
know ... well, we don't want you
to die [crosstalk] [laughs],

875
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:19,940
like from- from too many shots.
So--

876
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Bekah: Yeah, true. Like
[chuckles], we give you life.

877
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,150
Meg: I'll be fine.

878
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:20,175
Dan: [Chuckles] I'll be fine.

879
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:30,166
Meg: I just- I just might forget
some things, like how to walk

880
00:51:30,166 --> 00:51:30,496
or [Bekah and Dan chuckle] ...
you know?

881
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:32,615
Dan: We'll make sure you're nice
and comfy on your couch first

882
00:51:32,615 --> 00:51:33,890
[chuckles].

883
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:39,000
Meg: Yeah. Exactly.

884
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Bekah: Well, Meg--

885
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:50,844
Meg: I had- I had a silly origin
story for Kirk, if you had time.

886
00:51:51,324 --> 00:51:51,925
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

887
00:51:51,925 --> 00:51:52,664
Bekah: Of course.

888
00:51:52,664 --> 00:51:57,479
Meg: We talked about forgetting
something. So, in May, there's

889
00:51:57,479 --> 00:52:02,294
this

890
00:52:02,295 --> 00:52:12,014
thing called Philly Tech Week.
And this year, it's going

891
00:52:12,014 --> 00:52:19,065
May 6th through May 14th, and
it's hold on by Technical.ly

892
00:52:19,065 --> 00:52:28,724
Philly. A lot of the events are
gonna be virtual, I believe.

893
00:52:29,204 --> 00:52:31,154
I- I think some may be
in-person, but I think a lot

894
00:52:31,154 --> 00:52:33,104
will still be

895
00:52:33,105 --> 00:52:38,144
virtual. But this is a annual
thing. I think it's the 12th

896
00:52:38,144 --> 00:52:47,639
year this year. I'm not
positive. But in 2019, I

897
00:52:47,909 --> 00:52:55,199
applied for a scholarship to go
to one of their keynote events

898
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:59,879
and- and got the scholarship.
And there was just, like, all

899
00:52:59,879 --> 00:53:03,059
day, all

900
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:05,279
these presentations, and it was
at-- I'm pretty sure it was at

901
00:53:05,279 --> 00:53:12,900
the Comcast Center cuz it's,
like, one of the big tech hubs

902
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:17,565
in Philly. A lot of people are
reluctant about that being

903
00:53:17,565 --> 00:53:22,230
[chuckles] a big

904
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,915
tech spot in Philly. Gritty was
there. Gritty showed up

905
00:53:24,915 --> 00:53:27,570
in person [Bekah and Dan
chuckles].

906
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:35,280
Yeah. And-- yeah. It was really
cool. Got to, like, network and

907
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,427
meet a whole bunch of people.
And then, there was a after

908
00:53:38,427 --> 00:53:41,574
party

909
00:53:41,574 --> 00:53:46,319
thing to go out to a bar. And
... I networked with people at

910
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:51,064
these

911
00:53:51,065 --> 00:53:54,720
tables, and ... I was talking
with this one group, and the

912
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,375
people

913
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,174
just seem super nice. I think I
put down my backpack on the

914
00:54:00,174 --> 00:54:01,973
table, and

915
00:54:02,514 --> 00:54:05,647
they came to set up, and I was
... I don't- I don't know.

916
00:54:05,647 --> 00:54:08,780
Moving things around

917
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,610
my backpack or something, and
saying, "Oh, sorry. I'll get out

918
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:12,840
of here." And they're like, "Oh,
no, it's fine," and we just

919
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,070
started

920
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:19,920
chatting. And I found them later
at the happy hour. And it turned

921
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:27,300
out that, one of their C level
employees was visiting from the

922
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,209
West Coast. And he was buying us
all drinks for happy hour. He's

923
00:54:30,209 --> 00:54:33,118
like,

924
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,934
"Hey, do you wanna drink?"
cu-cuz I was just hanging out,

925
00:54:34,934 --> 00:54:36,718
talking

926
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:39,539
with them. And so, I got, like,
really roped up on this

927
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:42,359
company's

928
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,314
dime [Dan chuckles], and went to
the after parties after party,

929
00:54:45,314 --> 00:54:48,268
and they had

930
00:54:48,269 --> 00:54:52,911
this awesome DJ. And that was,
like, the technically Philly

931
00:54:52,911 --> 00:54:57,553
people. We're like, "Now we can

932
00:54:57,554 --> 00:54:59,909
let loose cuz the day's done."
And they're all dancing, and

933
00:54:59,909 --> 00:55:02,264
having

934
00:55:02,264 --> 00:55:08,235
fun and stuff. And then I looked
at my clock, and it was, like,

935
00:55:08,235 --> 00:55:10,439
one thirty or something. And the
last train had come and left

936
00:55:10,439 --> 00:55:12,643
[chuckles].

937
00:55:14,264 --> 00:55:15,195
Bekah: Oh, no.

938
00:55:16,005 --> 00:55:18,195
Meg: I was just like, "Oh, no.
What did I do [laughs]?"

939
00:55:21,795 --> 00:55:29,235
And it was really warm, so I
just walked around Philly. And

940
00:55:29,235 --> 00:55:35,113
so-- and I was, like, trying to
make it until the morning when

941
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:38,000
the train station open cuz I
didn't have-

942
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Dan: [Chuckles] Oh, no.

943
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,527
Meg: -enough money to take an
Uber [laughs]. And there's this

944
00:55:44,527 --> 00:55:50,054
guy that-- some guy in a
wheelchair

945
00:55:50,054 --> 00:55:54,584
scooter was coming down the
street, yelling at me, [laughs]

946
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:59,114
he's following me.

947
00:55:59,144 --> 00:56:02,979
And I'm just like, "Ah ...
[exhales] okay. I guess I'm

948
00:56:02,979 --> 00:56:06,814
gonna have to, like, look up the
credit card and take

949
00:56:06,815 --> 00:56:13,684
the Uber [laughs]." But it was a
great night.

950
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:21,209
Bekah: [Bekah and Dan laugh] Oh,
that is awesome. Well, Meg, it's

951
00:56:21,209 --> 00:56:23,609
been really great

952
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:28,380
having you on the podcast,
finally. Before we go, are

953
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,749
there any last fun Philly facts
that you would like to share

954
00:56:30,749 --> 00:56:33,118
with

955
00:56:33,449 --> 00:56:34,469
our listeners?

956
00:56:35,293 --> 00:56:39,189
Meg: I would like to say, we
have amazing food. If you're

957
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:43,085
ever in town,

958
00:56:44,226 --> 00:56:49,717
I encourage you go to the
Reading Terminal Market,

959
00:56:50,246 --> 00:56:54,366
basically ... like, weekdays are
best. Because the Mennonite

960
00:56:54,366 --> 00:56:58,486
people

961
00:56:58,487 --> 00:57:03,916
are there with, like, that good
home cook Pennsylvania Dutch

962
00:57:03,947 --> 00:57:10,396
food. And although we mentioned
Gritty definitely more

963
00:57:10,396 --> 00:57:12,556
than eight times at this
podcast, there's also the Philly

964
00:57:12,556 --> 00:57:14,716
Phanatic who is

965
00:57:14,717 --> 00:57:22,907
an amazing mascot. And I- I
can't leave him out either.

966
00:57:22,907 --> 00:57:26,367
Yeah. Those are my fun Philly
facts for all of you.

967
00:57:27,362 --> 00:57:28,623
Bekah: All right. Thanks, Meg.

968
00:57:29,163 --> 00:57:30,000
Dan: [Chuckles] Awesome. Thanks,
Meg.

00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
