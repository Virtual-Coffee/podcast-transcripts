00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:09,566
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello and
welcome to Season 8, Episode 5 of the

2
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:14,855
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah, and this is a podcast that

3
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:19,535
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:22,385
is an intimate community of
people at all stages of their

5
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:25,024
tech journey. And they're here, on
this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,475
stories and what they've learned.
And we're here to share it with

7
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:31,925
you. Here with me today is my
co-host, Dan.

8
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:34,685
Dan Ott: Yo. What up, Beck?
How's it going?

9
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:37,000
Bekah: It is going fantastic.

10
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,200
Dan: Nice.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,774
Bekah: How's it going with you?

10
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:42,643
Dan: It's going great. We have
another great episode for y'all.

11
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:45,643
We are sitting down with Reda.
Reda is a front-end developer

12
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:48,823
from Morocco. And we had a
really great talk ti- time talking to

13
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:52,844
him. He actually started his
career in marine mechanics,

14
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:56,533
which is pretty interesting.
And during the pandemic,

15
00:00:56,594 --> 00:00:59,893
decided to switch tracks into,
you know, web development and

16
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:03,194
front-end development in general.
And it was a really good time

17
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:07,034
sitting and talking with him. We- we
learned a lot about his story and--

18
00:01:07,453 --> 00:01:08,384
I dunno. He's a very interesting
guy.

19
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:10,813
Bekah: Yeah, it was really
fascinating to hear, like, he had

20
00:01:10,813 --> 00:01:15,224
completed all of the stuff that
he needed for the marine

21
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:21,433
mechanics degree. The-- and- and then
after completing that, decided to

22
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:26,353
go into coding and did the whole
self- self-taught route and what

23
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:29,983
that journey was like for him and
finding a job, you know? I think

24
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,793
that it's really fascinating
to see that career pivot

25
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,144
happening right at the pandemic
and then that journey to find the

26
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:38,743
first job.

27
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:39,800
Dan: Yeah, totally.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,200
Reda: Hi.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,004
Dan: A-a-and he's- he's one of
the fewer people I've

28
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:46,724
talked to recently who is
self-taught but didn't go the

29
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:50,444
bootcamp route, right? He- he
followed freeCodeCamp and a lot

30
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:54,524
of, just, self-guided things.
And-- I don't know. I mean, it's- it's really

31
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:58,093
great hearing from somebody who
had-- kind of did the self-driving, you

32
00:01:58,093 --> 00:02:00,134
know, educations route and--

33
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:02,500
Bekah: Yeah, the importance-

00:02:02,500 --> 
Dan: [Chuckles] I don't know.
[Unintelligible].

35
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,618
Bekah: -of community as part of
that, right?

34
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:07,409
Like, he talked a lot about
Virtual Coffee—being a part of

35
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,519
that, freeCodeCamp, Collab Lab, and
all of the ups and downs that you

36
00:02:11,524 --> 00:02:14,338
have as a self-taught learner, and
how important it is to have

37
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:17,549
community as part of that. So I
felt like this really captured

38
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:20,549
the essence of Virtual Coffee and
what we're trying to do here.

39
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:22,468
Dan: Absolutely.

40
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:25,829
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast like we start every

41
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,998
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

42
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:33,688
we're from, what we do, and a
random check-in question. We hope

43
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:46,038
you enjoy this episode. Our random
check-in question today is, what

44
00:02:46,038 --> 00:02:50,658
is your third space? So the space
where you feel like you belong,

45
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:54,734
something that's not home or
school. I give you a second to think

46
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:59,084
about that while I do my intro.
My name is Bekah. I am

47
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:03,493
Developer Experience Lead at
OpenSauced. I'm from a small town in

48
00:03:03,493 --> 00:03:09,644
Ohio, and my third space, I feel
like the woods is a good place.

49
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:12,253
It's like the woods are the
library because those have always

50
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:15,764
been places that I've loved since
I was a kid, and I could just go,

51
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:21,403
like, hike, or explore, or sit and
read a book for hours. And those

52
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:24,433
have always been, like, very
comforting spaces for me.

53
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:31,153
Dan: Nice. Yeah. Hi, I'm Dan. I
do front-end development or

54
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:33,764
whatever-- full stack development?
I don't know. I- I made a decision

55
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:37,003
earlier to just say I do full
stack even though I don't like

56
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:41,383
that phrase. But it is something that more
accurate to what I do. So, anyway--

57
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:47,264
oh, Cleveland area, and--
yeah. I mean, I-- I'd say the woods

58
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:50,834
in general as well. Maybe
specifically, like, we have a- a-- my

59
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:54,252
family has a cabin out in
Pennsylvania. But I'm really

60
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:57,641
comfortable in any- any- anywhere I
have a backpack on and, [chuckles] you know,

61
00:03:57,641 --> 00:04:01,812
maybe my pet-- my tent with me.
The woods-- the woods are good

62
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,771
for, like, all the reasons you
said, honestly. And e-exploring

63
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:09,328
especially is one of my-- one of my
favorite things to do. So yeah.

64
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:12,587
And-- yeah. So, introducing our
guest, Reda, go ahead.

65
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,220
Reda: I am Reda. I am a front-end
developer based in Morocco. And

66
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,430
my third place is, I think, I'll
go with the- the sea. Back in

67
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,810
college, I used to have this
coffee shop, it's, like, in front of

68
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,949
the-- of the beach to be
more accurate. And I used to

69
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:34,180
hang out there a lot. Yeah.

70
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,189
Bekah: That sounds awesome. I love
it. Well, thanks so much Reda for

71
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,370
being here with us today. We're
happy to have you on the pa- the

72
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,500
podcast. I like went-

73
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,000
Reda: Yeah.

74
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,980
Bekah: -Midwestern. The padcast
[chuckles]. I'm not [chuckles]-- I'm from Eastern

73
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,220
Ohio. We don't say it like that
here, I apologize [laughs]. And we always

74
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,060
like to get started with your
origin story. So I know that you

75
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,670
have a really fascinating one. So
why don't you let us know, like,

76
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,980
what you were doing before you
came into tech and what the

77
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,620
journey was like to getting your
first job.

78
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:10,891
Reda: Yeah, sure. I was in the
marine big-- mechanics field. So, like,

79
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:17,430
I used to go for-- in the
fishing ships. But I didn't

80
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:22,456
really, like, start working. I
just had training there. But, like,

81
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:29,266
my education was focused on that,
on the ma- marine mechanics. So

82
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:37,336
during my- during my graduation,
the- the pandemic hit. So-- yeah.

83
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:40,786
It hit when I-- when I was
preparing for my final projects

84
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:48,915
for the graduation. My final
project was kinda like related to,

85
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:53,776
programming? Not really. But I had
some parts of the pro- programming

86
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:58,786
in it. It was kinda like a- a
black box to me. I didn't

87
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:04,005
really, like-- I can say this. I
wasn't really working on the

88
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:07,665
programming part, but I was
curious about it. So I had-- I

89
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:12,946
was doing some, like, simulation
with MATLAB. I don't know if

90
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:17,235
you've ever heard of that. It's
like a software for simulation

91
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:22,755
but it- it has some stuff, like,
with programming in it. But I- I- I

92
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:27,975
didn't think I really touch it. I was just
copy paste the code there, working [??] with

93
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:34,696
it. Also, I had some- some
classes, like, in the-- some classes

94
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:41,776
back in college related to basic
algorithms and- and I-- if I

95
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:46,831
remember good, C++. And I
really liked them. So from there,

96
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:50,850
it started, like, my- my passion
too, and, like, my interest in

97
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:57,841
programming. So after graduation,
the-- I- I- I hadn't really a lot to

98
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:01,321
do. Because the pandemic, I'm stuck
at home, there's nothing I can do.

99
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:06,480
So I started, like, searching about
these things, that it was, like,

100
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,471
just a black box for me. I
started with machine learning,

101
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:17,115
which is kinda like weird [laughs]. 
It's-- I don't know. I was just looking for

102
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:21,105
something to start with, you know?
And one course on Coursera has

103
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:25,036
MATLAB and also, like, the stuff,
so I just started with machine

104
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:31,065
learning. After that--
machine learning-- like, in that

105
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:35,596
course, they were using MATLAB.
But they-- after finishing the

106
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:39,526
course, they said that, like,
Python is much better. And if you

107
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:43,995
wanna, like, learn more about this
stuff, you should, like, go with-

108
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:48,555
with Python. So I started
Python after machine learning [chuckles],

109
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:51,555
even though I didn't really do
anything with machine learning.

110
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,766
It was just, like, out of
curiosity. Just, like, how things

111
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:59,836
work. I started that course on,
like, "Python for Everybody" on

112
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:04,005
Coursera. It was really good,
and the- the teacher is really, like,

113
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:09,555
amazing. The most, like-- it's-
it's the-- I can't remember the-

114
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,016
the name. I think Dr.Chuck? I can't
remember the name. Anyway-- but

115
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:19,245
the course is, like, "Python for
Everybody", it was really amazing.

116
00:08:19,576 --> 00:08:25,800
And-- but after I finished that
course, I really didn't know what

117
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,821
to do with it. So I have the
knowledge, I have the basic

118
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:34,051
knowledge but I have no idea what
to do with it because, like, Python

119
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:41,100
is more for backend and it wasn't
any visual, like, feedback for me.

120
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:47,160
And they're more vis- like, a
visual person. So I started, like,

121
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,561
to search for something, like,
that has more interactivity.

122
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:56,250
So I do something and then see
the results in front of me. So

123
00:08:56,255 --> 00:09:00,870
more like a visual feedback as I
said. And during my search,

124
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:06,181
I was mainly searching for
free stuff because I- I wasn't

125
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:13,770
working, I was totally relying on
my parents [laughs]. So-- yeah. And I

126
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:19,291
found freeCodeCamp. So freeCodeCamp,
and from there, the-- like, the

127
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:23,791
real journey started. So the-- just
like the first challenge in

128
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:29,910
freeCodeCamp, you just do, like
... like small challenge, and

129
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,331
you see the result in front of
you, like, in the same moment, and

130
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:36,721
that was amazing. It was like, "Oh,
wow. I- I did something," you know?

131
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,500
Even though I spent maybe three
months on the- on the

132
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,010
specialization of Python, I never
felt the same when I- when I saw

133
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:48,541
the results in front of me, like,
in- in the same moment. Yeah. So I

134
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:54,666
finished freeCodeCamp, and after
that, I just was-- yeah. I was

135
00:09:54,666 --> 00:10:00,696
just, like, building projects
until I got into The Collab Lab.

136
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:06,875
And after The Collab Lab, I got,
like, my job directly after that,

137
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:09,216
like, after finishing The Collab
Lab. Yeah.

138
00:10:09,846 --> 00:10:12,515
Bekah: Awesome. Thanks so much.
It's such an interesting story to

139
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:17,826
hear that. And that process of
where you were in university and

140
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,735
what brought you to here-- I'm
curious, what kind of projects

141
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:24,456
were you working on in between
the end of freeCodeCamp and

142
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:25,115
Collab Lab?

143
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:32,176
Reda: Yeah. I- I was mainly
doing, like, the- the freeCodeCamp

144
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:39,076
projects because the- the
problem was in the- in freeCodeCamp--

145
00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:42,826
it's not a problem, but it's
just more of like the hard

146
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:49,275
part on freeCodeCamp is all the
learning is ... is text based,

147
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:56,206
you know? So it was kind of like
hard to understand some parts. So

148
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:59,355
I was, like, going to look on
YouTube, and on different blog

149
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,546
posts, and so on, and, like, keep,
like, re- revising what I was doing

150
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:09,015
before. And then I'm back to
the-- to projects on freeCodeCamp.

151
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:12,885
So I did the projects on
freeCodeCamp, and then I was

152
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:17,716
looking for, like, projects on
YouTube, projects on-- you know,

153
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:24,135
but- but that's the-- that's
tutorial hell. So [laughs]-- yeah. It was

154
00:11:24,135 --> 00:11:28,995
pretty much hard to get out of
it. It's-- the hardest part was--

155
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:32,686
the hardest part was when you
just look at the screen and you

156
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:37,515
don't know, like, from where to
start. But the built end projects

157
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:41,775
in freeCodeCamp were pretty
much, like, they- they give you the

158
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:45,166
... what you have to do, you know,
like, steps. They don't give you,

159
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:49,245
like, what you have to do, but
what's you are supposed to do. So,

160
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:54,076
like, the- the steps of the- the
process. So my projects mainly

161
00:11:54,076 --> 00:12:00,166
were freeCodeCamp projects plus
some YouTube tutorials and so on.

162
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:06,285
And then, I was, like, trying to
improve the- the projects I worked

163
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:10,620
on. So that's what I was doing. I
was, like, going in some areas

164
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,471
that I didn't touch during
freeCodeCamp, like testing,

165
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,291
accessibility, and so on.
Accessibility was covered in

166
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:20,880
freeCodeCamp but testing wasn't.
And I also was feeling, like, the

167
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,900
gaps because, I- I did—you
can say it's one of my mistakes

168
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:33,990
when I was learning—is the-- that I
was trying to be fast, to be like,

169
00:12:34,905 --> 00:12:38,745
"Just finish this, finish this,
finish this, and go on." And that,

170
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:44,145
like, left, like, some gaps in the
fundamentals. So yeah. Projects

171
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:47,446
will help you fill out that kind
of gaps. I think I didn't really

172
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:50,625
answer your question [laughs],
but-- yeah.

173
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:53,051
Bekah: Well, I think you definitely
answered the question. And I

174
00:12:53,056 --> 00:12:56,321
think that's really important,
that idea of going through too

175
00:12:56,321 --> 00:13:01,150
fast and having those learning
gaps. And I think that I also--

176
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,841
I went to bootcamp and it took me
a year. But I-- you know, I was

177
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:08,515
working at a slower pace and I
still think it was a little bit

178
00:13:08,515 --> 00:13:12,775
too fast for me too. And I did--
I had done a full stack program

179
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:18,235
after doing a portion of
freeCodeCamp. And there was just so

180
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:22,721
much material to get through in
that time period, but I

181
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:26,081
wondered-- I was, like, ready to move
on to the next phase of my life,

182
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:29,711
right? Like, ready to get a job.
And I- [chuckles] I remember thinking

183
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,890
afterwards like, "Oh, once I get
done with this, it's gonna be

184
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,941
easy." And, like, [chuckles] I don't know why I
thought that. But then, you start

185
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:42,100
your first job, you're like, "Oh,
that was the easy part and now

186
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,311
I've hit the hard part." And I
don't know if that resonates with

187
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:48,576
you or your experience in
Collab Lab, maybe filled in some

188
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:51,785
of those gaps and helped with
that, but I'm curious if- if you

189
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:53,466
had any of that experience too.

190
00:13:54,635 --> 00:14:01,551
Reda: Yeah. There, at The Collab Lab, I learned a lot,
like, mainly learned how to

191
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:04,910
collaborate because being a self-taught
developer are working by

192
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:10,490
yourself. Like, 100% by yourself. So
you don't know how to use, like--

193
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,571
not really how to use GitHub, but
how to use some features of

194
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:17,630
GitHub. So you don't know how to
open a pull request, you don't

195
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:23,030
know how to fix conflicts, you
don't know how-- yeah, you got

196
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:28,490
me. So-- yeah. Actually, like,
the Virtual Coffee, like,

197
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:32,615
Hacktoberfest challenge already
helps me with GitHub. Like, I got

198
00:14:32,615 --> 00:14:37,326
familiar with GitHub a little bit
and I make some contribution. But

199
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:41,166
it's different on The Collab Lab
because you are working-- like,

200
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:44,916
for over two months, you are
collaborating with three peoples

201
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:48,995
and you have mentors also, like,
they are helping you--

202
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:53,475
Bekah: What you said also really
resonated with me because I

203
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,995
went to a bootcamp but it was
self-paced. So I wasn't working

204
00:14:55,995 --> 00:15:00,855
with other people either. And I
remember-- so, for anybody that

205
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,524
doesn't know, Dan was the first
person to hire me out of

206
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:06,315
bootcamp. And we were, like, going
through all of this stuff, and--

207
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:10,860
actually, it was four years ago. I
think I started July 1st--

208
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,000
anyway, side- side note
[chuckles]. But-

209
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,500
Dan: Long ago.

210
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,480
Bekah: -[chuckles] it-- I
remember he- he was walking

209
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,279
me through it. He was like, "Yeah,
you just work through the issue

210
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,080
and then when you're done, you
create a pull request." And I was

211
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,000
like, "Okay. I know what a pull
request is. I've done that once or

212
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,350
twice [laughs]." But, like, now,
I'm like, "Okay, that seems like something

213
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,850
that's really basic." But even in
bootcamp, I was working on my own

214
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:41,159
projects. And so I wasn't making
pull requests. I- I once-- so, when I

215
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:45,299
built my first website, it was
my blogs, okay? And so I'm

216
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:48,240
writing these blogs but I didn't
even know that you could run it

217
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,539
locally. And so I was just, like,
pushing everything live, and then

218
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:54,899
looking at it, seeing what worked
and what didn't, and then, like,

219
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,139
recommitting. I-- actually all that
commit history is still there. So

220
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:01,700
anybody can go and- and see what
[laughs]-

221
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,000
Reda: Yeah.

221
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,690
Bekah: -what that process was
like. It- it

221
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,860
was a lot of, like, the basics.
What- what I would see now as

222
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,029
basics, of writing commit
messages, committing

223
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:16,049
frequently, running things locally
to test [chuckles] it before it goes live,

224
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:20,580
and pull requests. Like, none of
that stuff was natural to me

225
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,389
after that experience or really
emphasized as part of the

226
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:27,690
process. And you were talking
about freeCodeCamp because

227
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,500
you're not really making pull
requests there. And even-

228
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:30,700
Reda: Yeah.

229
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,110
Bekah: -when I did

228
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:34,769
the projects, I was doing them
in CodePen and- and-- so there's

229
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:39,029
not branches or any concept of
that kind of stuff. And that's

230
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,490
integral to being able to work
as part of a team.

231
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:47,080
Reda: Yeah. I- I had this funny,
like, the same issue. It's funny

232
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,639
because I was working most of
my projects, like, in freeCodeCamp

233
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:58,884
at first, like, on CodePen. So, after, like,
the first time, I wanted to, like,

234
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:04,944
do my project locally. I didn't
know how to do it. So [laughs]-- yeah. That's

235
00:17:04,944 --> 00:17:07,974
also part of, like, filling the gap.
It's- it's the very, very of the

236
00:17:07,974 --> 00:17:13,464
basics, but it's-- that you-- that-- it's-
it's hard when you are a self-taught.

237
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:18,954
You just don't know where
to go. It's-- like, you- you don't

238
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:24,730
have a plan, you know? FreeCodeCamp
make it easier, but still,

239
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,509
there- there are some gasp-- there
are some gaps that you- you just

240
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,170
don't know. Like, you- you didn't
even know them to fix them, you

241
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:32,800
know?

242
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,200
Bekah: Right.

243
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,410
Reda: But-- yeah. But when you
are, like, interaction with other

242
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:44,440
people-- so, here it come the roles
of communities and-- The Collab Lab,

243
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,529
Virtual Coffee. When you're
interacting with people, you see

244
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,990
their problems, you see what they
are doing, and you're learning

245
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,940
from them, and you got some
guidance.

246
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,609
Bekah: Yeah, I feel like I also
formed some bad habits during

247
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:00,299
that time period because I was
just working by myself. And-- so

248
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:04,589
I didn't know that there were
other ways of doing things. And

249
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:07,680
that was also something that I
had to kind of navigate and work

250
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,900
through. And I don't know if you
had that experience as well.

251
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:15,684
Reda: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the same
here. It was of lots of things

252
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:18,954
that you do. For example, I- I
didn't even know that you can

253
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:24,640
fork a repo, you know? So [chuckles] it was,
like, if I wanted to do something with her,

254
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,329
I would just try to push directly
to it. It doesn't matter if- if

255
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:34,299
it's mine or if it's someone's
projects, so-- yeah. Yeah. It- it- it

256
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,039
also, like, when you are coding,
you don't know if what you are

257
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,109
doing is the right way, you know?
Or if it's the best way and so

258
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:44,433
on.

259
00:18:45,193 --> 00:18:48,673
Dan: Yeah, totally. I-- there's so many
valuable aspects of having, you

260
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:51,223
know, working together on a team
with some people, even if

261
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:54,374
you're-- or- or just having extra
eyes on it, right- right? Like- like

262
00:18:54,523 --> 00:18:57,253
you were saying, you- you just
don't know-- you can hope that you--

263
00:18:57,253 --> 00:18:59,983
whatever you're doing is the best
way, you know? But having-

264
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:04,933
having extra people, it-- it's just
always so valuable. And whe- as far

265
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:08,534
as, you know, some of the open
source stuff, you know, like,

266
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:13,088
forking, right? Like, I have been
working on- on GitHub in my, like,

267
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:17,648
small team for work, for years,
before I ever forked any

268
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:20,409
repositories, right? Because if
you're on-- if you're in an

269
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,898
organization, you don't need
necessarily to fork-- you know,

270
00:19:22,903 --> 00:19:25,538
create your own forks. You- you-
you just create branches and do

271
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:27,669
that stuff. So I was comfortable
with that, but I had not- not, like,

272
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:32,023
ever done that whole flow,
right? Until-- honestly, until-- I

273
00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:34,334
mean, I think I'd done it a little
bit before Virtual Coffee, but I

274
00:19:34,364 --> 00:19:37,933
really, you know, actually
understood it much better [chuckles] once we

275
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:39,943
got into Virtual Coffee, and
started doing some of those open

276
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:43,273
source contributions, and-- yeah.
There's just-- there's just--

277
00:19:43,304 --> 00:19:46,784
when you're-- when you're by
yourself as a solo person, it can

278
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:50,683
be fun and it can be interesting.
But-- yeah. I always had that

279
00:19:50,683 --> 00:19:54,013
sense, I'm sure there's something
missing [laughs]. I'm sure there's some,

280
00:19:54,074 --> 00:19:56,594
you know, some pieces that I'm-
I'm not seeing or- or whatever.

281
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:59,953
And it's- it's just so nice to be
able to have other people are,

282
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:02,804
like, hanging around and- and- and,
you know, working together on-

283
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:03,193
on things.

284
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:06,000
Reda: Yeah. I think that the
first repo I- I forked was

285
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,683
Virtual Coffee, like, repo.
Yeah [chuckles].

286
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:12,493
Dan: It's a good one.

287
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:15,000
Bekah: And that- that [laughs]--
and that's one of the reasons

288
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,159
why our documentation for

288
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,628
Virtual Coffee-- to contribute
is very thorough. Like, maybe it's

289
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:25,019
a little bit too thorough. I'm not
sure. But because a lot of the

290
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:28,078
people that are contributing are
in the same situation that we

291
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:32,648
have both been in where we don't
have that experience of forking

292
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,669
or what is a commit? How do you
create a branch? And just to make

293
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,939
sure that we're able to support
those people as part of that

294
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:43,298
process and decrease the friction
for people to be able to

295
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:47,348
contribute, I think is really
important. And- and the same

296
00:20:47,354 --> 00:20:51,709
thing goes for people who have
been working for years, but like

297
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:55,098
Dan said, they- they don't have to
fork anything. I just taught an

298
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:59,388
intro to open source workshop a
couple of weeks ago and I had to

299
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,118
talk about forking a repository.
And so I, like, went through and I

300
00:21:02,124 --> 00:21:05,479
practiced because I honestly
don't know when the last time I

301
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:11,028
had to fork a repository was.
And- and it is those little things

302
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:16,699
that become really important. And-
and so I wanted to know—this

303
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:19,500
is, like, my very longwinded way 
[chuckles] of saying—you talked

302
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,719
about this open

304
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:23,868
source experience that you had
and you participated Hacktobershi-

305
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:27,700
you're- you're rocking your
Hacktoberfest shirt today-

306
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,000
Reda: Yeah.

306
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Bekah: -which is awesome. But
can you talk a little bit about

307
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,818
where that was

307
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:34,788
at in your journey and what kinds
of things that you were able to

308
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:36,588
accomplish during that
Hacktoberfest?

309
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:44,949
Reda: Yeah, sure. It's- it's
actually was, like, after finishing,

310
00:21:44,949 --> 00:21:50,618
like, freeCodeCamp. It's-- I- I
was in a-- okay, this is, like--

311
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:55,538
just, like side story. It's
not, like, really answering the

312
00:21:55,538 --> 00:22:01,568
question. So the-- I- I was pretty
much desperate after finishing

313
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:09,068
freeCodeCamp. I had HTML,
CSS knowledge, basic knowledge.

314
00:22:09,098 --> 00:22:15,788
I had JavaScript knowledge. But I
didn't know how to connect, like,

315
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:20,949
between them. I- I had no idea how--
okay. There is HTML, CSS, there is

316
00:22:21,068 --> 00:22:26,259
a JavaScript, but I had no idea how
to use both of them. And on

317
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:29,558
freeCodeCamp, it wasn't there
anything also, you know? So

318
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:33,999
after JavaScript, there is
directly React-- actually, front-end

319
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:38,439
libraries. So I- I was lost. I
was totally lost. I was desperate.

320
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:43,808
And at that moment, I was actually
thinking to give up because,

321
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:48,324
you know, imposter syndrome. I
was thinking that I'm low and I

322
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:53,213
don't know how to do things. So I-
I was thinking, "Maybe," like, "it's

323
00:22:53,213 --> 00:22:56,513
not for me," you know? Even though
it has nothing to do with me, I

324
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:59,243
just lack something, you know?
There is something missing and I

325
00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:03,683
don't know about it. So I posted
in the freeCodeCamp forum about

326
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:08,000
it. So I- I said-- I- I
literally saying like, "I am

327
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,023
done. I'm about to

327
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:13,824
give up and I don't know what
to do next. I have no idea." And

328
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:16,584
people there were very
supportive, you know? They—thanks

329
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:20,753
for them by the way—they were--
they were very supportive and

330
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:25,223
they told me like, "You just need
this-- the- the document objects

331
00:23:25,223 --> 00:23:31,644
model. DOM. So you can, like--
for manipulating, like, the HTML

332
00:23:31,648 --> 00:23:37,689
documents, and the browser
document, and so on." So-- and why

333
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:42,398
I'm telling you this story is
because at that same thread,

334
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:47,409
Jessica told me about Virtual
Coffee. And when I joined Virtual

335
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:52,088
Coffee after that, directly, like,
you were doing the Hacktoberfe-

336
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:55,929
the Hacktoberfest, like,
challenge. And from there, I got

337
00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:00,308
some energy. Yeah. I- I did-- I did
something and, like, I was, "Yeah,

338
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:05,874
I'm- I'm able to do this. I can
do this." So, back to the

339
00:24:05,874 --> 00:24:10,000
Hacktoberfest story. Well
[chuckles]-- yeah. So, for

340
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,074
Hacktoberfest, I had-- I had a

340
00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:19,344
mentor assigned, Justin. He
was pretty much helpful. He told--

341
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:24,384
like, he told me a lot of stuff
about, like, commits, how to

342
00:24:24,384 --> 00:24:27,864
fork, how to set up a stream, just
lots of information. I don't

343
00:24:27,864 --> 00:24:31,300
remember that [chuckles]. I was
like, "Okay. This is-- this is

344
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,003
exciting," you

344
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:35,000
know? [Chuckles] Exciting and
at same time, scary. All-- I

345
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,354
didn't know all of

345
00:24:36,354 --> 00:24:43,554
that. I didn't know anything. So,
yeah. He was, like-- he taught

346
00:24:43,554 --> 00:24:47,574
me all of that stuff and, like,
give me some resources to- to

347
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:53,304
search for open source
projects. But the hardest part

348
00:24:53,304 --> 00:24:57,669
about that is finding issues.
That's was the-- yeah. And that's

349
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:01,628
an- that's another thing. So when
you don't find issues or you--

350
00:25:01,628 --> 00:25:04,419
there- there is-- there are issues,
but the most of them you don't,

351
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:09,608
like, you don't know how to do
them. So I- I- I got, like,

352
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:13,700
frustrated again. So I don't 
[chuckles]-- like, it's-- you

353
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,098
think that it's you

353
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:19,433
who don't know anything, but
actually, the- the tech industry

354
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:22,943
is pretty, like, much broad, you
know? There- there are a lot of

355
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:26,003
stacks, there are a lot of things
that you don't know, of course.

356
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:34,584
So-- yep. After that, I was,
like, searching for things

357
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:40,554
that I know-- I know how to do.
So I was searching for some

358
00:25:40,554 --> 00:25:44,933
issues, I found, like, some, like,
small projects. They are-- they were--

359
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:48,564
maybe they were also learners.
They weren't, like- like, a big

360
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:52,344
companies or anything. Maybe they
were also learners or something

361
00:25:52,348 --> 00:26:00,503
like that. So I- I found
this small [??] projects. Like, people

362
00:26:00,503 --> 00:26:04,044
that own that small projects. And
I worked on small issues, for

363
00:26:04,044 --> 00:26:08,003
example, adding local storage to
a to-do app. It was something out

364
00:26:08,003 --> 00:26:13,523
of my comfort zone but also, like,
I know-- I- I- I know that I can

365
00:26:13,523 --> 00:26:20,183
do it, you know? So I did some
of those issues and I also did

366
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:26,544
one maybe for Virtual Coffee-- or
two, I can't remember. Yeah. But

367
00:26:26,604 --> 00:26:31,673
that actually boost my- my, like,
self-confidence, you know? I- I can

368
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:35,394
do stuff than-- and- and that's what
I was lucky than before, when I was

369
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:42,503
just by myself. Like, every time--
every time I don't know how to

370
00:26:42,503 --> 00:26:49,223
do something or-- I'm- I'm blaming
myself. And- and that was, like,

371
00:26:49,614 --> 00:26:52,314
the darkest points. Yeah.

372
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,719
Dan: I think any developer
who's been developing for an

373
00:26:57,719 --> 00:27:00,449
amount of time has gone through
those- those- those times. I know I

374
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:05,098
have a bunch of times over my
career. And I- I thi- I mean, I'm

375
00:27:05,098 --> 00:27:07,078
glad-- I just wanna say thank you
for sharing that because it's-

376
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:10,679
it's- it's good for people to hear
because-- especially when you

377
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,679
are, like, you-- like, a lot of
us are at the beginning kind of by

378
00:27:13,683 --> 00:27:17,278
yourselves and on your own. It can
be hard to know that- that sort of

379
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:19,700
thing is pretty common [laughs].
I feel like that-

380
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,000
Reda: Yep.

381
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,848
Dan: -feeling of- of "I don't

380
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,038
know how to do this. I don't know
how to do anything", you know,

381
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:29,699
is un- unfortunately, I- I guess,
a part of this-- part of this, like,

382
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:33,000
world as far as I've can tell
[laughs]-- and from my own

383
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,808
experience and my--

383
00:27:33,808 --> 00:27:38,098
experience of m-most of my
friends. It-- i-it's, like, you just

384
00:27:38,098 --> 00:27:41,068
come across those- those times,
you know? And I think it's a sign,

385
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:43,199
honestly. I-- it's a sign that you're
pushing yourself, you know, and

386
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,409
trying to learn more. And I think
it's—in general—a good sign,

387
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:48,700
although it's not ever fun when
you're-

388
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,000
Reda: Yeah.

389
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,000
Dan: -in the middle of it
[laughs].

390
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,973
Reda: Yeah.

388
00:27:51,973 --> 00:27:53,594
Dan: I think it's-- I think it's
a good sign because it means you're-

389
00:27:53,598 --> 00:27:56,594
you're-- you know, you're
learning, right? And you're trying

390
00:27:56,594 --> 00:27:58,903
things that you don't know
necessarily how to do it at the

391
00:27:58,903 --> 00:28:02,864
beginning. And that's- that's
something that- that, by myself,

392
00:28:02,864 --> 00:28:06,163
I've- I've run into as well as I
realized that I'm just, like, have

393
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:09,013
been very comfortable for a long
time, you know, and just doing the

394
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:12,953
same things. And so-some of it is a
little bit boring but-- or-- like,

395
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:15,263
there's a little bit of boredom
that sits in, but it's mostly just

396
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:18,324
this sense-- again, it's that sense,
you know, that you were talking

397
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:22,824
about, where you know that there's
something out there [chuckles] that you probably-

398
00:28:22,824 --> 00:28:23,000
Reda: Yeah.

398
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:24,804
Dan: -could be doing better, or
probably could be doing

399
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:28,193
differently, or a-anything like
that. And it-- and for me, it kind of

400
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:33,074
creeps up on me. But then you--
once you start, like, stretching

401
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:35,443
out again, you are risk-- run
the risk of running into those

402
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:38,000
feelings again [laughs]. So
it's- it's a never ending cycle,

403
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,653
you know? But

403
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:43,034
I think it's a healthy one,
in general. And I think it

404
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:46,064
sounds like the ways that you've
gotten through it are good in

405
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:48,884
healthy ways, you know, to do it,
you know? Finding communities,

406
00:28:48,888 --> 00:28:52,814
and finding people to work with,
and-- I don't know, everything like that.

407
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:56,229
Reda: Fi- finding inspiration
also, like, there are some

408
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:59,348
people in communities like that.
They- they just inspire you and

409
00:28:59,348 --> 00:29:03,848
you wanna, like, be like them, you
know? That keeps you, like, to-

410
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:08,229
to push yourself, like, harder
and just to not give up. Yep.

411
00:29:08,608 --> 00:29:09,368
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

412
00:29:11,513 --> 00:29:14,334
Bekah: Okay. So I wanna move
forward just a little bit on this

413
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:18,413
journey cuz I know that there's--
okay. So you did freeCodeCamp,

414
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:22,314
you did Collab Lab, and then
you're interviewing for jobs. At

415
00:29:22,314 --> 00:29:26,544
what point did you decide, "I'm
ready to interview for a role,"

416
00:29:26,544 --> 00:29:28,794
and then what- what did that
journey look like?

417
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:35,500
Reda: Yeah. Well, I would-- if I--
if I wa- if I didn't join [chuckles] 

418
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,300
Virtual Coffee, again [laughs],
I would never apply for jobs, I

419
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,838
think. I remember my

419
00:29:41,844 --> 00:29:46,459
first-- my first, like, coffee
chat was- was about my-- I put

420
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:50,689
the question about-- I asked a
question about this-- about when

421
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:56,118
you are ready to apply for jobs.
And someone told me, "Yesterday."

422
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:03,094
And- and-- yeah. And- and I- I-- that
clicked, you know? So you- you just

423
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:07,624
need to apply. You will never feel
ready. It's, again, im-imposter

424
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:10,864
syndrome, again. You will never
feel that you are ready. You will

425
00:30:10,864 --> 00:30:15,874
never feel that you know enough
to apply for job. So yeah. I

426
00:30:15,874 --> 00:30:22,219
think after- after, like,
freeCodeCamp, directly, like-- not

427
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:25,969
directly, but after finishing some
React projects, after I had some

428
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:31,219
React knowledge, I started
applying for jobs. That's also

429
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:37,398
as a pretty much hard. It was, like,
the- the worst period I think,

430
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:41,898
again, with frustration. And
whenever I get a rejection,

431
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:49,159
I blame myself. I take it
personally, you know? Yep. So

432
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:54,500
whenever I- I get rejection, I-
I just, like, drop everything

433
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,128
for two

433
00:30:55,134 --> 00:30:58,700
days [laughs]-- two or three
days. I just drop everything and

434
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,868
do nothing because

434
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:04,969
it was, like, hard on me, you know?
Because you- you kinda-- you

435
00:31:04,973 --> 00:31:09,648
don't know if the path you choose
is correct, you know? There is

436
00:31:09,648 --> 00:31:13,338
this- this- this doubt about will
you ever-- will you ever be able to

437
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:19,878
do it, you know? There is also,
like, the- the- the society, like,

438
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:25,608
pression, you know? You are-- you
are, like, without a job. You-

439
00:31:26,209 --> 00:31:29,328
you studied, and you are doing
nothing. It's not nothing. You are,

440
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:32,659
like, you are actually, like,
studying another thing. But what--

441
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:37,098
at-- there is always that question,
"What if I failed?" You know? And

442
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:41,300
rejections always remind- remind
me of the-- of failing, you

443
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,199
know, of the

443
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:49,433
end. If- if maybe-- if- if- if it
wasn't, like, the- the right path.

444
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:54,500
If all what I was doing is
just [chuckles]-- how I can say

445
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,844
it? Yeah. I guess you got me
[laughs].

446
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:02,229
Bekah: Oh. I definitely get that.
And it-- I even-- when I was laid off

447
00:32:02,229 --> 00:32:06,800
earlier this year, that-- it was
such a weird space to be in.

448
00:32:07,554 --> 00:32:07,554
I'd never

448
00:32:07,554 --> 00:32:10,223
been laid off before and I was
like, "I don't know. Maybe I should

449
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:13,763
just not be in tech," like, "maybe
this isn't for me," you know? And

450
00:32:14,243 --> 00:32:19,000
it- [chuckles] it really messes
with your head, I think, when

451
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,453
you start to

451
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:24,294
second guess yourself and- and you
feel that rejection in some way,

452
00:32:24,294 --> 00:32:27,354
whether or not, you know-- I went
through layoffs, they said it was

453
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:31,614
restructuring or whatever. So
there was nothing that implied

454
00:32:31,614 --> 00:32:35,844
like, "You did a bad job, so you
got fired," right? Or maybe the

455
00:32:35,844 --> 00:32:40,824
pandemic hits and you lose your
job for a little while. But

456
00:32:40,913 --> 00:32:45,534
it-- no matter what, all of those
things still feel-- they don't feel

457
00:32:45,534 --> 00:32:49,403
good and they make you question
like, "Is this the right place for

458
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:53,394
me?" And so, can you talk a
little bit more about how you've

459
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:55,973
navigated those frustrations?
Cuz I know it's really hard out

460
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:59,423
there for job seekers now,
especially for folks looking for

461
00:32:59,423 --> 00:33:00,000
their first-

462
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,300
Reda: Yep.

463
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,374
Bekah: -job in tech.

462
00:33:02,374 --> 00:33:08,374
Reda: Yeah, sure. I mainly was,
like, taking rest, as I said

463
00:33:08,374 --> 00:33:12,000
before. Like, if-- [chuckles] I
don't know if this is, like-- if

464
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,888
this is really the

464
00:33:12,888 --> 00:33:17,868
good way to go, but I was doing
that. I was taking rest for-- so, for

465
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:21,348
a day, for two days, I just don't
do anything just to- to get to

466
00:33:21,354 --> 00:33:24,828
myself, you know? Because
trying to learn new things or

467
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:30,913
trying to do, like-- or trying
to, like, prepare your resume, or

468
00:33:31,203 --> 00:33:35,673
your cover letter, or whatever you
are doing to-- for the job hunting

469
00:33:35,854 --> 00:33:38,733
while you are in a bad state of
mind, when you're, like, so

470
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:42,874
frustrating, it would just make it
worse, you know? And- and I even did

471
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:46,203
experience that. So for example,
if I got a rejection and I try

472
00:33:46,203 --> 00:33:52,114
to apply for another job, like,
the same day or something like

473
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:58,144
that, I- I find myself for--
okay. For- for example, if I try to-

474
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:02,794
to apply to- to a job, I- I will
just, like, look. And they will say,

475
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:07,354
okay, I am unqualified, you know?
I'm not good for- for applying

476
00:34:07,354 --> 00:34:10,954
for this. So that rejection will
affect you. So what I was doing is

477
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:16,503
just, like, resting a little bit,
maybe try to focus on learning

478
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:24,873
new things. Yeah. That-- that's it
mainly. And-- yeah. I will try to

479
00:34:24,873 --> 00:34:28,000
came up with something else. I
can't [chuckles]- I can't think

480
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,594
of any right now.

481
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,699
Bekah: I love that. I think that
it can be really hard to take a

482
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:36,088
rest and then what you do is just
burn yourself out during the job

483
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:40,264
search. And that idea of learning
something new I think is really

484
00:34:40,264 --> 00:34:43,143
good. Because you also start to
feel like stagnant when all

485
00:34:43,143 --> 00:34:46,083
you're doing is applying for
jobs and so you're not learning.

486
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,634
And there's-- I don't wanna say a
balance cuz I don't know that

487
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:52,744
there can be balance when you're
interviewing for a role. But it-

488
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:56,579
it helps to keep your morale up,
I think, a little bit when you can

489
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:00,119
see like, "Hey, I did this thing
today and now I know something

490
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,349
new," versus, "I did these interviews
today and I didn't get a job,"

491
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:08,039
which feels bad. So you gotta, like,
fill up that win bucket a little

492
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,789
bit somehow, and it's often not
going to be through interviewing.

493
00:35:12,813 --> 00:35:17,344
Reda: Yeah. I was also, like,
in the meanwhile, like,

494
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:24,813
preparing for quizzes for
interview questions. So it was--

495
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:29,134
I think that the hardest part in
this part of the journey is to-

496
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:34,474
to, as you said, is to have a
balance between learning, and

497
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:38,884
applying for roles, and, like,
studying for interviews. It's-

498
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:45,500
it's- it's just a mess
[chuckles]. But one thing also

499
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,954
that helps me is

499
00:35:46,983 --> 00:35:50,614
the community, again. So being
inside the community, you see that

500
00:35:50,614 --> 00:35:55,233
there are a lot of people like you,
you know? And the moment they got

501
00:35:55,233 --> 00:36:00,664
the-- their first job or they got
the-- anyway, when- when- when they--

502
00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:04,233
when they get their, like, the--
their dream job or whatever,

503
00:36:04,384 --> 00:36:07,563
it's- it's, like, kind of a
motivation to you. So, again,

504
00:36:08,884 --> 00:36:12,423
[chuckles] finding community is,
like, the-- was the key.

505
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:17,744
Bekah: Yeah, I think that's so
important. And so, how did you

506
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:20,023
end up landing the job that
you're currently at now?

507
00:36:21,184 --> 00:36:25,300
Reda: Yeah. I- I consider
myself, like, lucky [chuckles],

508
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,583
I guess. So I- I

508
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:34,534
didn't actually apply for the job
I am currently at right now. So

509
00:36:34,563 --> 00:36:40,700
they find me through GitHub.
They, like-- they put, like, a

510
00:36:41,554 --> 00:36:41,554
query search

510
00:36:41,554 --> 00:36:46,204
there. So, you know, GitHub have
this- this query search, you know? So

511
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,000
you can put queries and you can,
like, search for- for some

512
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,253
criteria, you

512
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:56,103
know? And I was-- yeah, again,
I was lucky that I was part of

513
00:36:56,103 --> 00:37:01,849
those people. So they contact
me on LinkedIn-- ah, sorry. I-

514
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:04,000
I was lucky that I was part of
the result of the search

515
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,548
[laughs]. Yeah. So,

515
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:13,099
they contact me, like, on LinkedIn,
and they said, "Hi, we find your

516
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:16,500
profile interesting, and we
would like to talk about the

517
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,989
..." yeah. So I

517
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:22,000
said, "Okay, we can talk." We-
we, like, schedule, like, a

518
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,728
meeting. I

518
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:27,498
thought it was just a meeting to
talk about, like, how things will

519
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:30,829
go, you know? What's they're
looking for, what they are, and so

520
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:36,000
on. But it turns out, like, it's
an interview, and [laughs]--

521
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,458
yeah. But it was

521
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:40,398
pretty much smooth. They- they were,
like, cool people. It was pretty

522
00:37:40,398 --> 00:37:47,398
much smooth because-
because I-- when I asked how,

523
00:37:47,403 --> 00:37:51,588
like, they choose me, actually, they
said, like, they- they- they went

524
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:54,168
through the code, actually, you
know? They went through my code,

525
00:37:54,168 --> 00:38:00,918
they went through my projects. So
I think that the process of

526
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:05,000
hiring is- [chuckles] is the
main cause why I- I am where I

527
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,128
am right now. Yeah.

527
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:16,219
So I-- it's may not be the- the case
for- for everyone, but just put

528
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:19,219
yourself out there, you know? If
you have any projects, even if

529
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:23,989
they are small or if they are,
like, really not that interesting.

530
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:28,159
I don't wanna say that they're
not interesting, but just put your

531
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,929
projects out there. Put them on
Twitter, GitHub, everywhere. And--

532
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:36,648
yeah. That's it. So-- anyway,
sorry, I [laughs]--

533
00:38:38,298 --> 00:38:38,688
Bekah: Don't be sorry.

534
00:38:38,688 --> 00:38:43,309
Reda: Yep. So after the
interview, I-- they actually,

535
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:47,268
like, just sends me the- the
offer. Yeah.

536
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:47,898
Bekah: Wow.

537
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:52,864
Reda: Yeah, it was pretty-- so they--
it was kinda like the- the moment

538
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:55,443
they contact me, they already made
their mind that they're gonna

539
00:38:55,443 --> 00:39:01,474
hire me. So it was just about
if I say yes or no. So yeah.

540
00:39:02,378 --> 00:39:05,378
Bekah: That's awesome. Is it a
company in your country?

541
00:39:06,393 --> 00:39:09,664
Reda: Yeah, it's in my country,
but it's remote. It's 100% remote.

542
00:39:09,963 --> 00:39:13,744
So yeah. It was actually too
good to be true. So [laughs]--

543
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:17,800
Bekah: [Chuckles] I almost [??]
like- like the idea of a

544
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,313
surprise interview, cuz

544
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:21,534
then you're not really nervous if
you just think that you're going

545
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:23,000
in to talk to them and then
they're [chuckles] like, "Oh,

546
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,700
surprise interview." And you're
like, "Well, I didn't have the

547
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,384
last three days to panic. So I
guess, here I am." Like [laughs]--

547
00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:31,804
Reda: Yeah, yeah. But- but it- it
wasn't any hard, you know? It was

548
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:35,373
more of a discussion than an
interview, you know? But it- it-

549
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:39,000
it was, like, the first and the
final [laughs]. So it's-- it

550
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,873
was pretty much good.

550
00:39:39,903 --> 00:39:43,534
Because I had-- previously, I had
some pretty much bad experience

551
00:39:43,534 --> 00:39:46,700
with going through three
interviews, and in the end

552
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,809
getting, like, rejected. So
[chuckles] yeah.

553
00:39:52,074 --> 00:39:54,500
Bekah: Do you-- did you find,
like, living in Morocco, that

554
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,000
the job search was even more
challenging, if you were looking

555
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,213
for remote work?

556
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:05,719
Reda: It was more challenging
for me because I didn't have--

557
00:40:06,168 --> 00:40:09,768
I didn't have a degree, you know?
I didn't have a degree in

558
00:40:09,768 --> 00:40:12,648
computer science. I have a degree
in marine mechanics, but not in

559
00:40:12,648 --> 00:40:17,148
computer science. And in Morocco,
it's- it's kinda-- I di- I wasn't

560
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:22,068
even applying for jobs in Morocco
because I thought it's- it's

561
00:40:22,278 --> 00:40:24,000
impossible for me to get a job
here.

562
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,300
Bekah: Wow.

563
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,014
Reda: As most of companies, they

562
00:40:26,014 --> 00:40:30,393
are, like, asking for a degree,
you know? And the funny thing

563
00:40:31,384 --> 00:40:34,833
is, during my interview with my
current company, the first thing I

564
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:39,094
said is, "I don't have a degree.
Just for information, I don't have

565
00:40:39,094 --> 00:40:43,443
a degree in computer science."
But surprisingly, they said like,

566
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:48,603
"What matter is talent and not,
like, a piece of paper." And that

567
00:40:48,603 --> 00:40:56,208
was, like-- e-even if I didn't,
like, get in the- the company,

568
00:40:56,228 --> 00:40:57,849
that was a boost for me. Yeah.

569
00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:00,414
Bekah: That's awesome.

570
00:41:00,844 --> 00:41:03,244
Dan: It's good to hear. I mean,
that- that- that aligns, I

571
00:41:03,514 --> 00:41:07,300
think, with a lot of the people
that I end up, [chuckles] you

572
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,164
know, enjoying working

572
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:12,903
for, right? The- the degrees are--
I don't know. It's-- it almost

573
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,364
seems silly sometimes. I mean, not
that getting a degree is silly.

574
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:19,554
But, like, the idea that in our
field, a degree after four years,

575
00:41:19,554 --> 00:41:22,000
I feel like is going to be so
out of date [chuckles] to be

576
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,213
almost-- I-- not

576
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:25,434
useless, obviously. You-- like, in
college, I think the important

577
00:41:25,434 --> 00:41:28,554
thing is to, like, learn how to
learn, right? That's- that's more--

578
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:32,753
you know? But at the same time,
somebody with a- a certain

579
00:41:32,753 --> 00:41:35,063
amount of experience is going to
have the same, if not a better,

580
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:37,824
you know, handle on all that
stuff than somebody who just-

581
00:41:38,514 --> 00:41:39,324
Reda: Yeah. Yeah.

582
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,193
Dan: -going [??] to college, you
know?

583
00:41:40,744 --> 00:41:45,273
Reda: That's- that's a good
point because that-- the current

584
00:41:45,278 --> 00:41:49,969
company, like, they told me that
they interview, like, people

585
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:55,369
with degrees and, like, engineers,
you know, like, before me. But the-

586
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:59,898
the only difference is I had
projects. I had, like-- I know how to

587
00:41:59,898 --> 00:42:02,869
search for information and how--
I know how to learn by myself.

588
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:09,018
Yeah. And, like, one of the plus
for me is that I was a self-taught

589
00:42:09,018 --> 00:42:14,628
developer. So they know, like,
they- they won't need-- it--

590
00:42:14,628 --> 00:42:17,778
it's just a sign that you can
learn by- by yourself, you know?

591
00:42:20,244 --> 00:42:22,793
Dan: Yeah, a hundred percent
with that. I mean, that-- that's

592
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:25,614
always-- that's always gonna be a-
a point in your favor in my book.

593
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:30,300
Just-- I mean, as a self-taught
developer myself [laughs], you

594
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,253
know? I mean,

594
00:42:31,253 --> 00:42:33,503
but I know-- I understand, like,
what the struggles are and, like,

595
00:42:33,503 --> 00:42:37,704
how much it takes to continue
through that process, you know,

596
00:42:37,704 --> 00:42:41,994
and that career. And so I-- that--
that's-- I was just glad to hear

597
00:42:41,994 --> 00:42:43,500
that, you know [chuckles], you
found a place that- that

598
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,123
respects that sort of thing-

598
00:42:44,193 --> 00:42:44,543
Reda: Thank you, thank you.

599
00:42:44,934 --> 00:42:47,000
Dan: -because it-- it's not
always, you know, it's- it's--

600
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,204
you're not-- not

600
00:42:48,204 --> 00:42:51,713
everybody's gonna feel the same
way and-- I don't know. It's nice

601
00:42:51,713 --> 00:42:54,293
to hear when- when that sort of
thing works out well like it has

602
00:42:54,293 --> 00:42:54,954
in your case.

603
00:42:55,693 --> 00:42:55,983
Reda: Yeah.

604
00:42:57,978 --> 00:43:00,278
Bekah: Well, Reda, we wanna thank
you for being here with us today.

605
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:03,998
Are there any new-- last words
of advice that you have for our

606
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,179
listeners about their job search
or being self-taught?

607
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:14,119
Reda: Yeah. Thanks for having
me. And I know, like, the- the

608
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:17,929
situation in the US—I don't know
if it's in all the world [??]—but it's

609
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:22,759
pretty much tough with the-- with
all the layoffs happening-- the

610
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:27,679
layed offs happening. So-- yep.
Stay- stay strong, and you can

611
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:28,938
do it. Yeah.

612
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:35,391
Dan: Okay. Alrite. Well, cool. Well,
thank you, Reda, for joining us so

613
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:40,822
much and-- yeah. We will catch
everybody next week. Alrite.

614
00:43:40,822 --> 00:43:41,242
Thanks, Reda.

615
00:43:41,646 --> 00:43:41,867
Bekah: Bye.

616
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:42,621
