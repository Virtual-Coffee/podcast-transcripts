00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:07,811
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello and
welcome to Season 8, Episode 5

2
00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:09,566
of the

3
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:12,210
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah, and this is a podcast

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,854
that

5
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:19,535
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:22,385
is an intimate community of
people at all stages of their

7
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:25,024
tech journey. And they're here,
on this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,749
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

9
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:28,474
it with

10
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:31,925
you. Here with me today is my
co-host, Dan.

11
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:34,685
Dan Ott: Yo. What up, Beck?
How's it going?

12
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:37,000
Bekah: It is going fantastic.

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,200
Dan: Nice.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,774
Bekah: How's it going with you?

15
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:42,643
Dan: It's going great. We have
another great episode for y'all.

16
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:45,643
We are sitting down with Reda.
Reda is a front-end developer

17
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:47,233
from Morocco. And we had a
really great talk ti- time

18
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:48,823
talking to

19
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:52,844
him. He actually started his
career in marine mechanics,

20
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:56,533
which is pretty interesting. And
during the pandemic,

21
00:00:56,594 --> 00:00:59,893
decided to switch tracks into,
you know, web development and

22
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:01,679
front-end development in
general. And it was a really

23
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,194
good time

24
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:05,114
sitting and talking with him.
We- we learned a lot about his

25
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:07,034
story and--

26
00:01:07,453 --> 00:01:08,384
I dunno. He's a very interesting
guy.

27
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:09,943
Bekah: Yeah, it was really
fascinating to hear, like, he

28
00:01:09,943 --> 00:01:10,813
had

29
00:01:10,813 --> 00:01:15,224
completed all of the stuff that
he needed for the marine

30
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:18,328
mechanics degree. The-- and- and
then after completing that,

31
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,432
decided to go into

32
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:26,353
coding, and did the whole self-
self-taught, route and what

33
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,168
that journey was like for him
and finding a job, you know? I

34
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:29,983
think

35
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,793
that it's really fascinating to
see that career pivot

36
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,143
happening right at the pandemic
and then that journey to find

37
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:38,743
the first job.

38
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:39,800
Dan: Yeah, totally.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,200
Reda: Hi.

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,004
Dan: A-a-and he's- he's one of
the fewer people I've

41
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:46,724
talked to recently who is
self-taught but didn't go the

42
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:50,444
bootcamp route, right? He- he
followed freeCodeCamp and a lot

43
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,484
of, just, self-guided things.
And-- I don't know. I mean,

44
00:01:52,484 --> 00:01:54,524
it's- it's really

45
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:56,308
great hearing from somebody who
had-- kind of did the

46
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:58,092
self-driving, you

47
00:01:58,093 --> 00:02:00,134
know, educations route and--

48
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:02,500
Bekah: Yeah, the importance-

49
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Dan: [Chuckles] I don't know.
[Unintelligible].

50
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,618
Bekah: -of community as part of
that, right?

51
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:07,409
Like, he talked a lot about
Virtual Coffee — being a part of

52
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,464
that, freeCodeCamp, Collab Lab,
and all of the ups and downs

53
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:11,519
that you

54
00:02:11,524 --> 00:02:14,338
have as a self-taught learner,
and how important it is to have

55
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:17,549
community as part of that. So I
felt like this really captured

56
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,064
the essence of Virtual Coffee
and what we're trying to do

57
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:20,549
here.

58
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:22,468
Dan: Absolutely.

59
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:25,829
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast like we start every

60
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,998
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

61
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:33,688
we're from, what we do, and a
random check-in question. We

62
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:39,863
hope you enjoy this episode. Our
random check-in question today

63
00:02:39,863 --> 00:02:46,038
is, what

64
00:02:46,038 --> 00:02:48,348
is your third space? So the
space where you feel like you

65
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:50,658
belong,

66
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:52,698
something that's not home or
school. I give you a second to

67
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:54,733
think

68
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:59,084
about that while I do my intro.
My name is Bekah. I am

69
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:01,288
Developer Experience Lead at
OpenSauced. I'm from a small

70
00:03:01,288 --> 00:03:03,492
town in

71
00:03:03,493 --> 00:03:09,644
Ohio, and my third space, I feel
like the woods is a good place.

72
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:11,068
It's like the woods are the
library because those have

73
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:12,253
always

74
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:14,008
been places that I've loved
since I was a kid, and I could

75
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:15,763
just go,

76
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:18,583
like, hike, or explore, or sit
and read a book for hours. And

77
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,402
those

78
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:24,433
have always been, like, very
comforting spaces for me.

79
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:31,153
Dan: Nice. Yeah. Hi, I'm Dan. I
do front-end development or

80
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:32,458
whatever-- full stack
development? I don't know. I- I

81
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,763
made a decision

82
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:37,003
earlier to just say I do full
stack even though I don't like

83
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,195
that phrase. But it is something
that more accurate to what I do.

84
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:41,382
So, anyway--

85
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:47,264
oh, Cleveland area, and-- yeah.
I mean, I-- I'd say the woods

86
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:49,049
in general as well. Maybe
specifically, like, we have a-

87
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:50,834
a-- my

88
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:54,252
family has a cabin out in
Pennsylvania. But I'm really

89
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:55,946
comfortable in any- any-
anywhere I have a backpack on

90
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:57,640
and, [chuckles] you know,

91
00:03:57,641 --> 00:04:01,812
maybe my pet-- my tent with me.
The woods-- the woods are good

92
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,771
for, like, all the reasons you
said, honestly. And e-exploring

93
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:07,579
especially is one of my-- one of
my favorite things to do. So,

94
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:09,327
yeah.

95
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:12,587
And-- yeah. So, introducing our
guest, Reda, go ahead.

96
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,060
Reda: I am Reda. I am a
front-end developer based in

97
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,220
Morocco. And

98
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,430
my third place is, I think, I'll
go with the- the sea. Back in

99
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,620
college, I used to have this
coffee shop. It's, like, in

100
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,810
front of

101
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,949
the-- of the beach to be more
accurate. And I used to

102
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:34,180
hang out there a lot. Yeah.

103
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,989
Bekah: That sounds awesome. I
love it. Well, thanks so much

104
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:37,188
Reda for

105
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,370
being here with us today. We're
happy to have you on the pa- the

106
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,500
podcast. I like went-

107
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,000
Reda: Yeah.

108
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,290
Bekah: -Midwestern. The padcast
[chuckles]. I'm not [chuckles]--

109
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,980
I'm from Eastern

110
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,100
Ohio. We don't say it like that
here, I apologize [laughs]. And

111
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,220
we always

112
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,060
like to get started with your
origin story. So I know that you

113
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,365
have a really fascinating one.
So why don't you let us know,

114
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,670
like,

115
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,980
what you were doing before you
came into tech and what the

116
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,620
journey was like to getting your
first job.

117
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,056
Reda: Yeah, sure. I was in the
marine big-- mechanics field.

118
00:05:08,056 --> 00:05:10,891
So, like,

119
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:17,430
I used to go for-- in the
fishing ships. But I didn't

120
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:22,455
really, like, start working. I
just had training there. But,

121
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:25,861
like, my education was focused
on that, on the ma- marine

122
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:29,266
mechanics. So during

123
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:33,315
my-- during my graduation, the-
the pandemic hit. So--

124
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:37,335
yeah.

125
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:40,786
It hit when I-- when I was
preparing for my final projects

126
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:48,915
for the graduation. My final
project was kinda like related

127
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:51,361
to, programming? Not really. But
I had some parts of the pro-

128
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:53,776
programming

129
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:58,786
in it. It was kinda like a- a
black box to me. I didn't

130
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:04,005
really, like-- I can say this. I
wasn't really working on the

131
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:07,665
programming part, but I was
curious about it. So I had-- I

132
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:12,946
was doing some, like, simulation
with MATLAB. I don't know if

133
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:17,235
you've ever heard of that. It's
like a software for simulation

134
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:20,220
but it- it has some stuff, like,
with programming in it. But I-

135
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,755
I- I

136
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:25,365
didn't think I really touch it.
I was just copy paste the code

137
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:27,975
there, working [??] with

138
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:31,335
it. Also, I had some- some
classes, like, in the-- some

139
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:34,695
classes

140
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:41,776
back in college related to basic
algorithms and- and I-- if I

141
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:46,831
remember good, C++. And I really
liked them. So from there, it

142
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:50,850
started, like, my- my passion,
too, and, like, my interest in

143
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,345
programming. So after
graduation, the-- I- I- I hadn't

144
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:57,840
really a lot to

145
00:06:57,841 --> 00:06:59,581
do. Because the pandemic, I'm
stuck at home. There's nothing I

146
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:01,321
can do.

147
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,900
So I started, like, searching
about these things, that it was,

148
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,479
like,

149
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,471
just a black box for me. I
started with machine learning,

150
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:13,823
which is kinda like weird
[laughs]. It's-- I don't know. I

151
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:17,115
was just looking for

152
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:21,105
something to start with, you
know? And one course on Coursera

153
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:23,086
has MATLAB and also, like, the
stuff, so I just started with

154
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:25,036
machine

155
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:31,065
learning. After that-- machine
learning-- like, in that

156
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:35,596
course, they were using MATLAB.
But they-- after finishing the

157
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:37,561
course, they said that, like,
Python is much better. And if

158
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:39,526
you

159
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:43,994
wanna, like, learn more about
this stuff, you should, like, go

160
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:46,275
with- with Python. So I started
Python after machine learning

161
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:48,555
[chuckles],

162
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:51,555
even though I didn't really do
anything with machine learning.

163
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,163
It was just, like, out of
curiosity. Just, like, how

164
00:07:53,163 --> 00:07:54,766
things

165
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:59,836
work. I started that course on--
like, "Python for Everybody" on

166
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:02,045
Coursera. It was really good,
and the- the teacher is really,

167
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:04,004
like,

168
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:09,555
amazing. The most, like-- it's-
it's the-- I can't remember the-

169
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,288
the name. I think Dr.Chuck? I
can't remember the name.

170
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:15,016
Anyway-- but

171
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:17,130
the course is, like, "Python for
Everybody", it was really

172
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,244
amazing.

173
00:08:19,576 --> 00:08:25,800
And-- but after I finished that
course, I really didn't know

174
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,821
what to do with it. So I have
the knowledge, I have the basic

175
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:31,936
knowledge but I have no idea
what to do with it because,

176
00:08:31,936 --> 00:08:34,051
like, Python

177
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:37,575
is more for backend and it
wasn't any visual, like,

178
00:08:37,575 --> 00:08:41,099
feedback for me.

179
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:44,175
And they're more vis- like, a
visual person. So I started,

180
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:47,159
like,

181
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,561
to search for something, like,
that has more interactivity.

182
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:56,250
So I do something and then see
the results in front of me. So

183
00:08:56,255 --> 00:09:00,870
more like a visual feedback as I
said. And during my search,

184
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:06,181
I was mainly searching for free
stuff because I- I wasn't

185
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:09,975
working, I was totally relying
on my parents [laughs]. So--

186
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:13,769
yeah. And I

187
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:16,533
found freeCodeCamp. So
freeCodeCamp, and from there,

188
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:19,291
the-- like, the

189
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:23,791
real journey started. So the--
just like the first challenge in

190
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:29,910
freeCodeCamp, you just do, like
... like small challenge, and

191
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,620
you see the result in front of
you, like, in the same moment,

192
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,330
and

193
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:35,026
that was amazing. It was like,
"Oh, wow. I- I did something,"

194
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:36,721
you know?

195
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,500
Even though I spent maybe three
months on the-- on the

196
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,255
specialization of Python, I
never felt the same when I--

197
00:09:42,255 --> 00:09:44,010
when I saw

198
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,275
the results in front of me,
like, in- in the same moment.

199
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:48,540
Yeah. So I

200
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:54,666
finished freeCodeCamp, and after
that, I just was-- yeah. I was

201
00:09:54,666 --> 00:10:00,696
just, like, building projects
until I got into The Collab Lab.

202
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:06,875
And after The Collab Lab, I got,
like, my job directly after

203
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:09,216
that, like, after finishing The
Collab Lab. Yeah.

204
00:10:09,846 --> 00:10:11,180
Bekah: Awesome. Thanks so much.
It's such an interesting story

205
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,514
to

206
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:17,826
hear that. And that process of
where you were in university and

207
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,735
what brought you to here-- I'm
curious, what kind of projects

208
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:24,456
were you working on in between
the end of freeCodeCamp and

209
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:25,115
Collab Lab?

210
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:29,371
Reda: Yeah. I- I was mainly
doing, like, the- the

211
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:32,176
freeCodeCamp

212
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:35,641
projects because the- the
problem was in the-- in

213
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:39,076
freeCodeCamp--

214
00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:42,826
it's not a problem, but it's
just more of like the hard

215
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:49,275
part on freeCodeCamp is all the
learning is ... is text based,

216
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:56,206
you know? So it was kind of like
hard to understand some parts.

217
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:59,355
So I was, like, going to look on
YouTube, and on different blog

218
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,953
posts, and so on, and, like,
keep, like, re- revising what I

219
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,546
was doing

220
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:06,780
before. And then I'm back to
the-- to projects on

221
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,014
freeCodeCamp.

222
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:12,885
So I did the projects on
freeCodeCamp and then I was

223
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:17,716
looking for, like, projects on
YouTube, projects on, you know--

224
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:21,155
but- but that's the-- that's
tutorial hell. So [laughs]--

225
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:24,134
yeah. It was

226
00:11:24,135 --> 00:11:26,565
pretty much hard to get out of
it. It's-- the hardest part

227
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:28,995
was--

228
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:32,686
the hardest part was when you
just look at the screen and you

229
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:35,100
don't know, like, from where to
start. But the built end

230
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,514
projects

231
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:41,774
in freeCodeCamp were pretty
much, like, they- they give you

232
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:43,785
the ... what you have to do, you
know, like, steps. They don't

233
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:45,165
give you,

234
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,205
like, what you have to do but
what's you are supposed to do.

235
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:49,244
So,

236
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:54,076
like, the- the steps of the- the
process. So my projects mainly

237
00:11:54,076 --> 00:12:03,285
were freeCodeCamp projects plus
some YouTube tutorials and so

238
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:03,285
on. And then, I was, like,
trying to improve the- the

239
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:06,285
projects I worked

240
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:10,620
on. So that's what I was doing.
I was, like, going in some areas

241
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,471
that I didn't touch during
freeCodeCamp, like testing,

242
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,291
accessibility, and so on.
Accessibility was covered in

243
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:20,879
freeCodeCamp but testing wasn't.
And I also was feeling, like,

244
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,900
the gaps because, I- I did — you
can say it's one of my mistakes

245
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,945
when I was learning — is the--
that I was trying to be fast, to

246
00:12:30,945 --> 00:12:33,990
be like,

247
00:12:34,905 --> 00:12:36,825
"Just finish this, finish this,
finish this, and go on." And

248
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:38,745
that,

249
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:41,445
like, left, like, some gaps in
the fundamentals. So-- yeah.

250
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:44,145
Projects

251
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:47,446
will help you fill out that kind
of gaps. I think I didn't really

252
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:50,625
answer your question [laughs]
but-- yeah.

253
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:52,256
Bekah: Well, I think you
definitely answered the

254
00:12:52,256 --> 00:12:53,051
question. And I

255
00:12:53,056 --> 00:12:56,321
think that's really important,
that idea of going through too

256
00:12:56,321 --> 00:13:01,150
fast and having those learning
gaps. And I think that I also--

257
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,995
I went to bootcamp and it took
me a year. But I-- you know, I

258
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:04,840
was

259
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:08,515
working at a slower pace and I
still think it was a little bit

260
00:13:08,515 --> 00:13:12,775
too fast for me too. And I did--
I had done a full stack program

261
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:18,235
after doing a portion of
freeCodeCamp. And there was just

262
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:22,721
so much material to get through
in that time period, but I

263
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:24,401
wondered-- I was, like, ready to
move on to the next phase of my

264
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:26,081
life,

265
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:27,896
right? Like, ready to get a job.
And I- [chuckles] I remember

266
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:29,711
thinking

267
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,890
afterwards like, "Oh, once I get
done with this, it's gonna be

268
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,915
easy." And, like, [chuckles] I
don't know why I thought that.

269
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,940
But then, you start

270
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:42,100
your first job, you're like,
"Oh, that was the easy part and

271
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,310
now I've hit the hard part." And
I don't know if that resonates

272
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:48,576
with you or your experience in
Collab Lab, maybe filled in some

273
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:51,785
of those gaps and helped with
that, but I'm curious if- if you

274
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:53,466
had any of that experience too.

275
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:58,093
Reda: Yeah. There, at The Collab
Lab, I learned a lot, like,

276
00:13:58,093 --> 00:14:01,551
mainly learned how to

277
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:03,230
collaborate because being a
self-taught developer are

278
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,909
working by

279
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,700
yourself. Like, 100% by
yourself. So you don't know how

280
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,490
to use, like--

281
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,571
not really how to use GitHub,
but how to use some features of

282
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:17,630
GitHub. So you don't know how to
open a pull request, you don't

283
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:23,030
know how to fix conflicts, you
don't know how-- yeah, you got

284
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:28,490
me. So-- yeah. Actually, like,
the Virtual Coffee, like,

285
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:32,615
Hacktoberfest challenge already
helps me with GitHub. Like, I

286
00:14:32,615 --> 00:14:34,970
got familiar with GitHub a
little bit and I make some

287
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,325
contribution. But

288
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:41,166
it's different on The Collab Lab
because you are working-- like,

289
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:44,916
for over two months, you are
collaborating with three peoples

290
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:48,995
and you have mentors also, like,
they are helping you--

291
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:53,475
Bekah: What you said also really
resonated with me because I

292
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,995
went to a bootcamp but it was
self-paced. So I wasn't working

293
00:14:55,995 --> 00:15:00,855
with other people either. And I
remember-- so, for anybody that

294
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,524
doesn't know, Dan was the first
person to hire me out of

295
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:04,934
bootcamp. And we were, like,
going through all of this stuff,

296
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:06,314
and--

297
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:10,860
actually, it was four years ago.
I think I started July 1st--

298
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,000
anyway, side- side note
[chuckles]. But-

299
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,500
Dan: Long ago.

300
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,480
Bekah: -[chuckles] it-- I
remember he- he was walking

301
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,379
me through it. He was like,
"Yeah, you just work through the

302
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:20,278
issue

303
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,179
and then when you're done, you
create a pull request." And I

304
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:22,079
was

305
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,540
like, "Okay. I know what a pull
request is. I've done that once

306
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,000
or

307
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,175
twice [laughs]." But, like, now,
I'm like, "Okay, that seems like

308
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:31,350
something

309
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,600
that's really basic." But even
in bootcamp, I was working on my

310
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,850
own

311
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,504
projects. And so I wasn't making
pull requests. I- I once-- so,

312
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,158
when I

313
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:45,299
built my first website, it was
my blogs, okay? And so I'm

314
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:48,240
writing these blogs but I didn't
even know that you could run it

315
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,889
locally. And so I was just,
like, pushing everything live,

316
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,538
and then

317
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:53,221
looking at it, seeing what
worked and what didn't, and

318
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:54,898
then, like,

319
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,519
recommitting. I-- actually all
that commit history is still

320
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,139
there. So

321
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:01,700
anybody can go and- and see what
[laughs]-

322
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,000
Reda: Yeah.

323
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,690
Bekah: -what that process was
like. It- it

324
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,860
was a lot of, like, the basics.
What- what I would see now as

325
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,029
basics of writing commit
messages, committing

326
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,069
frequently, running things
locally to test [chuckles] it

327
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:16,048
before it goes live,

328
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:20,580
and pull requests. Like, none of
that stuff was natural to me

329
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,389
after that experience or really
emphasized as part of the

330
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:27,690
process. And you were talking
about freeCodeCamp because

331
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,500
you're not really making pull
requests there. And even-

332
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:30,700
Reda: Yeah.

333
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,110
Bekah: -when I did

334
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:34,769
the projects, I was doing them
in CodePen and- and-- so there's

335
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:39,029
not branches or any concept of
that kind of stuff. And that's

336
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,490
integral to being able to work
as part of a team.

337
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:47,080
Reda: Yeah. I- I had this funny,
like, the same issue. It's funny

338
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,639
because I was working most of my
projects, like, in freeCodeCamp

339
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,307
at first, like, on CodePen. So
after, like, the first time, I

340
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:58,884
wanted to, like,

341
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,034
do my project locally. I didn't
know how to do it. So [laughs]--

342
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:04,943
yeah. That's

343
00:17:04,944 --> 00:17:06,459
also part of, like, filling the
gap. It's- it's the very, very

344
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,974
of the

345
00:17:07,974 --> 00:17:10,719
basics, but it's-- that you--
that-- it's- it's hard when you

346
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:13,464
are a self-taught.

347
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:18,954
You just don't know where to go.
It's-- like, you- you don't

348
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,842
have a plan, you know?
FreeCodeCamp make it easier, but

349
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:24,730
still,

350
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,619
there- there are some gasp--
there are some gaps that you-

351
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,508
you just

352
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,430
don't know. Like, you- you
didn't even know them to fix

353
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,800
them, you know?

354
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,200
Bekah: Right.

355
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,805
Reda: But-- yeah. But when you
are, like, interaction with

356
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,410
other

357
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,425
people-- so, here it come the
roles of communities and-- The

358
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:44,440
Collab Lab,

359
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,529
Virtual Coffee. When you're
interacting with people, you see

360
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:48,759
their problems, you see what
they are doing, and you're

361
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:49,989
learning

362
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,940
from them, and you got some
guidance.

363
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,609
Bekah: Yeah, I feel like I also
formed some bad habits during

364
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:00,299
that time period because I was
just working by myself. And-- so

365
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:04,589
I didn't know that there were
other ways of doing things. And

366
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:07,680
that was also something that I
had to kind of navigate and work

367
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,900
through. And I don't know if you
had that experience as well.

368
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:15,684
Reda: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the same
here. It was of lots of things

369
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:18,954
that you do. For example, I- I
didn't even know that you can

370
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:21,797
fork a repo, you know? So
[chuckles] it was, like, if I

371
00:18:21,797 --> 00:18:24,640
wanted to do something with her,

372
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,529
I would just try to push
directly to it. It doesn't

373
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:28,328
matter if- if

374
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:31,317
it's mine or if it's someone's
projects, so-- yeah. Yeah. It-

375
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:34,299
it- it

376
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,039
also, like, when you are coding,
you don't know if what you are

377
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,574
doing is the right way, you
know? Or if it's the best way

378
00:18:41,574 --> 00:18:44,433
and so on.

379
00:18:45,193 --> 00:18:46,933
Dan: Yeah, totally. I-- there's
so many valuable aspects of

380
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:48,673
having, you

381
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:51,223
know, working together on a team
with some people, even if

382
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:52,798
you're-- or- or just having
extra eyes on it, right- right?

383
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,373
Like- like

384
00:18:54,523 --> 00:18:55,888
you were saying, you- you just
don't know-- you can hope that

385
00:18:55,888 --> 00:18:57,253
you--

386
00:18:57,253 --> 00:18:59,983
whatever you're doing is the
best way, you know? But having-

387
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:02,488
having extra people, it-- it's
just always so valuable. And

388
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:04,932
whe- as far

389
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:08,534
as, you know, some of the open
source stuff, you know, like,

390
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:10,811
forking, right? Like, I have
been working on- on GitHub in

391
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:13,088
my, like,

392
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:17,648
small team for work, for years,
before I ever forked any

393
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:20,409
repositories, right? Because if
you're on-- if you're in an

394
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,898
organization, you don't need
necessarily to fork-- you know,

395
00:19:22,903 --> 00:19:25,538
create your own forks. You- you-
you just create branches and do

396
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:26,603
that stuff. So I was comfortable
with that but I had not- not,

397
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:27,668
like,

398
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:32,023
ever done that whole flow,
right? Until-- honestly, until--

399
00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:33,178
I mean, I think I'd done it a
little bit before Virtual

400
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:34,333
Coffee but I

401
00:19:34,364 --> 00:19:36,148
really, you know, actually
understood it much better

402
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:37,932
[chuckles] once we

403
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:39,943
got into Virtual Coffee, and
started doing some of those open

404
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:41,608
source contributions, and--
yeah. There's just-- there's

405
00:19:41,608 --> 00:19:43,273
just--

406
00:19:43,304 --> 00:19:46,784
when you're-- when you're by
yourself as a solo person, it

407
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:48,733
can be fun and it can be
interesting. But-- yeah. I

408
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:50,682
always had that

409
00:19:50,683 --> 00:19:52,348
sense, I'm sure there's
something missing [laughs]. I'm

410
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:54,013
sure there's some,

411
00:19:54,074 --> 00:19:56,594
you know, some pieces that I'm-
I'm not seeing or- or whatever.

412
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:58,273
And it's- it's just so nice to
be able to have other people

413
00:19:58,273 --> 00:19:59,952
are,

414
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,381
like, hanging around and- and-
and, you know, working together

415
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:03,193
on- on things.

416
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:06,000
Reda: Yeah. I think that the
first repo I- I forked was

417
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,683
Virtual Coffee, like, repo. Yeah
[chuckles].

418
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:12,493
Dan: It's a good one.

419
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:15,000
Bekah: And that- that [laughs]--
and that's one of the reasons

420
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,159
why our documentation for

421
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:19,393
Virtual Coffee-- to contribute
is very thorough. Like, maybe

422
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:21,627
it's

423
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:23,326
a little bit too thorough. I'm
not sure. But because a lot of

424
00:20:23,326 --> 00:20:25,018
the

425
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:28,078
people that are contributing are
in the same situation that we

426
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:32,648
have both been in where we don't
have that experience of forking

427
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,658
or what is a commit? How do you
create a branch? And just to

428
00:20:34,658 --> 00:20:36,668
make

429
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,939
sure that we're able to support
those people as part of that

430
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:43,297
process and decrease the
friction for people to be able

431
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:47,348
to contribute, I think is really
important. And- and the same

432
00:20:47,354 --> 00:20:51,709
thing goes for people who have
been working for years. But like

433
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,403
Dan said, they- they don't have
to fork anything. I just taught

434
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:55,097
an

435
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:59,388
intro to open source workshop a
couple of weeks ago and I had to

436
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,117
talk about forking a repository.
And so I, like, went through and

437
00:21:02,124 --> 00:21:05,479
I practiced because I honestly
don't know when the last time I

438
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:08,253
had to fork a repository was.
And- and it is those little

439
00:21:08,253 --> 00:21:11,027
things

440
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:13,863
that become really important.
And- and so I wanted to

441
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:16,698
know — this

442
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:18,099
is, like, my very longwinded way
[chuckles] of saying — you

443
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:19,499
talked

444
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,719
about this open

445
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:22,293
source experience that you had
and you participated

446
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:23,867
Hacktobershi-

447
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:27,700
you're- you're rocking your
Hacktoberfest shirt today-

448
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,000
Reda: Yeah.

449
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Bekah: -which is awesome. But
can you talk a little bit about

450
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,818
where that was

451
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:34,788
at in your journey and what
kinds of things that you were

452
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:36,588
able to accomplish during that
Hacktoberfest?

453
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,439
Reda: Yeah, sure. It's- it's
actually was, like, after

454
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:44,949
finishing,

455
00:21:44,949 --> 00:21:50,618
like, freeCodeCamp. It's-- I- I
was in a-- okay. This is, like--

456
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:55,538
just, like, side story. It's
not, like, really answering the

457
00:21:55,538 --> 00:21:58,553
question. So the-- I- I was
pretty much desperate after

458
00:21:58,553 --> 00:22:01,568
finishing

459
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:09,068
freeCodeCamp. I had HTML, CSS
knowledge, basic knowledge.

460
00:22:09,098 --> 00:22:12,443
I had JavaScript knowledge. But
I didn't know how to connect,

461
00:22:12,443 --> 00:22:15,788
like,

462
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:18,383
between them. I- I had no idea
how-- okay. There is HTML, CSS,

463
00:22:18,383 --> 00:22:20,948
there is

464
00:22:21,068 --> 00:22:26,259
a JavaScript, but I had no idea
how to use both of them. And on

465
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:29,558
freeCodeCamp, it wasn't there
anything also, you know? So

466
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:31,781
after JavaScript, there is
directly React-- actually,

467
00:22:31,781 --> 00:22:33,998
front-end

468
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:36,219
libraries. So I- I was lost. I
was totally lost. I was

469
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:38,439
desperate.

470
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:41,123
And at that moment, I was
actually thinking to give up

471
00:22:41,123 --> 00:22:43,807
because,

472
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:48,324
you know, imposter syndrome. I
was thinking that I'm low and I

473
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:50,768
don't know how to do things. So
I- I was thinking, "Maybe,"

474
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:53,212
like, "it's

475
00:22:53,213 --> 00:22:54,863
not for me," you know? Even
though it has nothing to do with

476
00:22:54,863 --> 00:22:56,513
me, I

477
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:59,243
just lack something, you know?
There is something missing and I

478
00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:03,683
don't know about it. So I posted
in the freeCodeCamp forum about

479
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:08,000
it. So I- I said-- I- I
literally saying like, "I am

480
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,023
done. I'm about to

481
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:13,824
give up and I don't know what to
do next. I have no idea." And

482
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:15,204
people there were very
supportive, you know?

483
00:23:15,204 --> 00:23:16,584
They — thanks for

484
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:20,753
them by the way — they were--
they were very supportive and

485
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:22,988
they told me like, "You just
need this-- the- the document

486
00:23:22,988 --> 00:23:25,223
objects

487
00:23:25,223 --> 00:23:31,644
model. DOM. So you can, like--
for manipulating, like, the HTML

488
00:23:31,648 --> 00:23:34,668
documents, and the browser
document, and so on." So-- and

489
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:37,688
why

490
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:42,398
I'm telling you this story is
because at that same thread,

491
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:44,919
Jessica told me about Virtual
Coffee. And when I joined

492
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:47,409
Virtual

493
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:49,748
Coffee after that, directly,
like, you were doing the

494
00:23:49,748 --> 00:23:52,087
Hacktoberfe-

495
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:55,929
the Hacktoberfest, like,
challenge. And from there, I got

496
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:58,118
some energy. Yeah. I- I did-- I
did something and, like, I was,

497
00:23:58,118 --> 00:24:00,307
"Yeah,

498
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:05,874
I'm- I'm able to do this. I can
do this." So, back to the

499
00:24:05,874 --> 00:24:10,000
Hacktoberfest story. Well
[chuckles]-- yeah. So, for

500
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,074
Hacktoberfest, I had-- I had a

501
00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:19,344
mentor assigned, Justin. He was
pretty much helpful. He told--

502
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:24,384
like, he told me a lot of stuff
about, like, commits, how to

503
00:24:24,384 --> 00:24:26,124
fork, how to set up a stream,
just lots of information. I

504
00:24:26,124 --> 00:24:27,864
don't

505
00:24:27,864 --> 00:24:31,300
remember that [chuckles]. I was
like, "Okay. This is-- this is

506
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,003
exciting," you

507
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:35,000
know? "[Chuckles] Exciting and
at same time, scary." All-- I

508
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,354
didn't know all of

509
00:24:36,354 --> 00:24:39,954
that. I didn't know anything.
So, yeah. He was, like-- he

510
00:24:39,954 --> 00:24:43,554
taught

511
00:24:43,554 --> 00:24:47,574
me all of that stuff and, like,
give me some resources to- to

512
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:53,304
search for open source projects.
But the hardest part

513
00:24:53,304 --> 00:24:55,486
about that is finding issues.
That's was the-- yeah. And

514
00:24:55,486 --> 00:24:57,668
that's

515
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:59,648
an- that's another thing. So
when you don't find issues or

516
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,627
you--

517
00:25:01,628 --> 00:25:03,023
there- there is-- there are
issues, but the most of them you

518
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:04,418
don't,

519
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:09,608
like, you don't know how to do
them. So I- I- I got, like,

520
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:13,700
frustrated again. So I don't
[chuckles]-- like, it's-- you

521
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,098
think that it's you

522
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:19,433
who don't know anything but
actually, the- the tech industry

523
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:22,943
is pretty, like, much broad, you
know? There- there are a lot of

524
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:24,518
stacks, there are a lot of
things that you don't know of

525
00:25:24,518 --> 00:25:26,002
course.

526
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:34,584
So-- yep. After that, I was,
like, searching for things

527
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:40,554
that I know-- I know how to do.
So I was searching for some

528
00:25:40,554 --> 00:25:42,743
issues, I found, like, some,
like, small projects. They are--

529
00:25:42,743 --> 00:25:44,932
they were--

530
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:48,564
maybe they were also learners.
They weren't, like- like, a big

531
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:50,888
companies or anything. Maybe
they were also learners or

532
00:25:50,888 --> 00:25:52,343
something

533
00:25:52,348 --> 00:25:56,425
like that. So I- I found this
small [??] projects. Like,

534
00:25:56,425 --> 00:26:00,502
people

535
00:26:00,503 --> 00:26:02,273
that own that small projects.
And I worked on small issues,

536
00:26:02,273 --> 00:26:04,043
for

537
00:26:04,044 --> 00:26:08,002
example, adding local storage to
a to-do app. It was something

538
00:26:08,003 --> 00:26:10,763
out of my comfort zone but also,
like, I know-- I- I- I know that

539
00:26:10,763 --> 00:26:13,523
I can

540
00:26:13,523 --> 00:26:20,183
do it, you know? So I did some
of those issues and I also did

541
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:26,544
one maybe for Virtual Coffee--
or two, I can't remember. Yeah.

542
00:26:26,604 --> 00:26:29,138
But that actually boost my- my,
like, self-confidence, you know?

543
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:31,672
I- I can

544
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,533
do stuff than-- and- and that's
what I was lucky than before,

545
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:35,393
when I was

546
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:38,950
just by myself. Like, every
time-- every time I don't know

547
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,502
how to

548
00:26:42,503 --> 00:26:45,863
do something or-- I'm- I'm
blaming myself. And- and that

549
00:26:45,863 --> 00:26:52,314
was, like, the darkest points.
Yeah.

550
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,719
Dan: I think any developer who's
been developing for an

551
00:26:57,719 --> 00:26:59,084
amount of time has gone through
those- those- those times. I

552
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,449
know I

553
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:02,773
have a bunch of times over my
career. And I- I thi- I mean,

554
00:27:02,773 --> 00:27:05,097
I'm

555
00:27:05,098 --> 00:27:06,088
glad-- I just wanna say thank
you for sharing that because

556
00:27:06,088 --> 00:27:07,078
it's-

557
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:08,878
it's- it's good for people to
hear because-- especially when

558
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,678
you

559
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,179
are, like, you-- like, a lot of
us are at the beginning kind of

560
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:13,679
by

561
00:27:13,683 --> 00:27:15,480
yourselves and on your own. It
can be hard to know that- that

562
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,277
sort of

563
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:19,700
thing is pretty common [laughs].
I feel like that-

564
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,000
Reda: Yep.

565
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,848
Dan: -feeling of- of "I don't

566
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,038
know how to do this. I don't
know how to do anything", you

567
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,429
know, is un- unfortunately, I- I
guess, a part of this-- part of

568
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:29,699
this, like,

569
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:33,000
world as far as I've can tell
[laughs]-- and from my own

570
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,808
experience and my--

571
00:27:33,808 --> 00:27:35,953
experience of m-most of my
friends. It-- i-it's, like, you

572
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:38,098
just

573
00:27:38,098 --> 00:27:39,583
come across those- those times,
you know? And I think it's a

574
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,068
sign,

575
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:42,133
honestly. I-- it's a sign that
you're pushing yourself, you

576
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:43,198
know, and

577
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,806
trying to learn more. And I
think it's, in general, a good

578
00:27:44,806 --> 00:27:46,409
sign,

579
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:48,700
although it's not ever fun when
you're-

580
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,000
Reda: Yeah.

581
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,000
Dan: -in the middle of it
[laughs].

582
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,973
Reda: Yeah.

583
00:27:51,973 --> 00:27:52,783
Dan: I think it's-- I think it's
a good sign because it means

584
00:27:52,783 --> 00:27:53,593
you're-

585
00:27:53,598 --> 00:27:55,096
you're-- you know, you're
learning, right? And you're

586
00:27:55,096 --> 00:27:56,594
trying

587
00:27:56,594 --> 00:27:58,903
things that you don't know
necessarily how to do it at the

588
00:27:58,903 --> 00:28:02,864
beginning. And that's- that's
something that- that, by myself,

589
00:28:02,864 --> 00:28:04,513
I've- I've run into as well as I
realized that I'm just, like,

590
00:28:04,513 --> 00:28:06,162
have

591
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:09,013
been very comfortable for a long
time, you know, and just doing

592
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:10,983
the same things. And so-some of
it is a little bit boring but--

593
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,953
or-- like,

594
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:14,108
there's a little bit of boredom
that sits in but it's mostly

595
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:15,263
just

596
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:17,003
this sense-- again, it's that
sense, you know, that you were

597
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:18,323
talking

598
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:20,574
about, where you know that
there's something out there

599
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,824
[chuckles] that you probably-

600
00:28:22,824 --> 00:28:23,000
Reda: Yeah.

601
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:24,804
Dan: -could be doing better, or
probably could be doing

602
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:26,498
differently, or a-anything like
that. And it-- and for me, it

603
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:28,192
kind of

604
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:33,074
creeps up on me. But then you--
once you start, like, stretching

605
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:35,443
out again, you are risk-- run
the risk of running into those

606
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:38,000
feelings again [laughs]. So
it's- it's a never ending cycle,

607
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,653
you know? But

608
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:43,034
I think it's a healthy one, in
general. And I think it

609
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:46,064
sounds like the ways that you've
gotten through it are good in

610
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:47,474
healthy ways, you know, to do
it, you know? Finding

611
00:28:47,474 --> 00:28:48,884
communities,

612
00:28:48,888 --> 00:28:50,851
and finding people to work with,
and-- I don't know, everything

613
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:52,814
like that.

614
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:56,229
Reda: Fi- finding inspiration
also, like, there are some

615
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:59,348
people in communities like that.
They- they just inspire you and

616
00:28:59,348 --> 00:29:01,598
you wanna, like, be like them,
you know? That keeps you, like,

617
00:29:01,598 --> 00:29:03,848
to-

618
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:08,229
to push yourself, like, harder
and just to not give up. Yep.

619
00:29:08,608 --> 00:29:09,368
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

620
00:29:11,513 --> 00:29:14,333
Bekah: Okay. So I wanna move
forward just a little bit on

621
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:16,373
this journey cuz I know that
there's-- okay. So you did

622
00:29:16,373 --> 00:29:18,412
freeCodeCamp,

623
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:22,314
you did Collab Lab, and then
you're interviewing for jobs. At

624
00:29:22,314 --> 00:29:26,544
what point did you decide, "I'm
ready to interview for a role,"

625
00:29:26,544 --> 00:29:28,794
and then what- what did that
journey look like?

626
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:32,849
Reda: Yeah. Well, I would-- if
I-- if I wa- if I didn't join

627
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:35,499
[chuckles]

628
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,300
Virtual Coffee, again [laughs],
I would never apply for jobs, I

629
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,838
think. I remember my

630
00:29:41,844 --> 00:29:46,459
first-- my first, like, Coffee
chat was- was about my-- I put

631
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:50,689
the question about-- I asked a
question about this-- about when

632
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:53,403
you are ready to apply for jobs.
And someone told me,

633
00:29:53,403 --> 00:29:56,117
"Yesterday."

634
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:00,183
And- and-- yeah. And- and I- I--
that clicked, you know? So you-

635
00:30:00,183 --> 00:30:03,093
you just

636
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:05,359
need to apply. You will never
feel ready. It's, again,

637
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:07,624
im-imposter

638
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:09,246
syndrome, again. You will never
feel that you are ready. You

639
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:10,864
will

640
00:30:10,864 --> 00:30:15,874
never feel that you know enough
to apply for job. So-- yeah. I

641
00:30:15,874 --> 00:30:19,046
think after- after, like,
freeCodeCamp, directly, like--

642
00:30:19,046 --> 00:30:22,218
not

643
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:25,969
directly, but after finishing
some React projects, after I had

644
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:31,219
some React knowledge, I started
applying for jobs. That's also

645
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:34,308
as a pretty much hard. It was,
like, the- the worst period I

646
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:37,397
think,

647
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:41,898
again, with frustration. And
whenever I get a rejection,

648
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:49,159
I blame myself. I take it
personally, you know? Yep. So

649
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:54,500
whenever I- I get rejection, I-
I just, like, drop everything

650
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,128
for two

651
00:30:55,134 --> 00:30:58,700
days [laughs]-- two or three
days. I just drop everything and

652
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,868
do nothing because

653
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:04,968
it was, like, hard on me, you
know? Because you- you kinda--

654
00:31:04,973 --> 00:31:07,310
you don't know if the path you
choose is correct, you know?

655
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,647
There is

656
00:31:09,648 --> 00:31:11,493
this- this- this doubt about
will you ever-- will you ever be

657
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:13,338
able to

658
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:16,608
do it, you know? There is also,
like, the- the- the society,

659
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:19,878
like,

660
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,743
pression, you know? You are--
you are, like, without a job.

661
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:25,608
You-

662
00:31:26,209 --> 00:31:27,768
you studied and you are doing
nothing. It's not nothing. You

663
00:31:27,768 --> 00:31:29,327
are,

664
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:31,028
like, you are actually, like,
studying another thing. But

665
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:32,658
what--

666
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:35,043
at-- there is always that
question, "What if I failed?"

667
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:37,097
You know? And

668
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:41,300
rejections always remind- remind
me of the-- of failing, you

669
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,199
know, of the

670
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:49,433
end. If- if maybe-- if- if- if
it wasn't, like, the- the right

671
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:54,500
path. If all what I was doing is
just [chuckles]-- how I can say

672
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,844
it? Yeah. I guess you got me
[laughs].

673
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,469
Bekah: Oh. I definitely get
that. And it-- I even-- when I

674
00:32:00,469 --> 00:32:02,229
was laid off

675
00:32:02,229 --> 00:32:06,800
earlier this year, that-- it was
such a weird space to be in.

676
00:32:07,554 --> 00:32:07,554
I'd never

677
00:32:07,554 --> 00:32:08,888
been laid off before and I was
like, "I don't know. Maybe I

678
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:10,222
should

679
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:11,993
just not be in tech," like,
"maybe this isn't for me," you

680
00:32:11,993 --> 00:32:13,763
know? And

681
00:32:14,243 --> 00:32:19,000
it- [chuckles] it really messes
with your head, I think, when

682
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,453
you start to

683
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:22,373
second guess yourself and- and
you feel that rejection in some

684
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,293
way,

685
00:32:24,294 --> 00:32:25,824
whether or not, you know-- I
went through layoffs, they said

686
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:27,354
it was

687
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:31,614
restructuring or whatever. So
there was nothing that implied

688
00:32:31,614 --> 00:32:35,844
like, "You did a bad job, so you
got fired," right? Or maybe the

689
00:32:35,844 --> 00:32:40,824
pandemic hits and you lose your
job for a little while. But

690
00:32:40,913 --> 00:32:43,223
it-- no matter what, all of
those things still feel-- they

691
00:32:43,223 --> 00:32:45,533
don't feel

692
00:32:45,534 --> 00:32:49,402
good and they make you question
like, "Is this the right place

693
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:53,394
for me?" And so, can you talk a
little bit more about how you've

694
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:55,973
navigated those frustrations?
Cuz I know it's really hard out

695
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:59,423
there for job seekers now,
especially for folks looking for

696
00:32:59,423 --> 00:33:00,000
their first-

697
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,300
Reda: Yep.

698
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,374
Bekah: -job in tech.

699
00:33:02,374 --> 00:33:08,374
Reda: Yeah, sure. I mainly was,
like, taking rest as I said

700
00:33:08,374 --> 00:33:12,000
before. Like, if-- [chuckles] I
don't know if this is, like-- if

701
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,888
this is really the

702
00:33:12,888 --> 00:33:15,378
good way to go but I was doing
that. I was taking rest for--

703
00:33:15,378 --> 00:33:17,868
so, for

704
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:21,348
a day, for two days, I just
don't do anything just to- to

705
00:33:21,354 --> 00:33:24,828
get to myself, you know? Because
trying to learn new things or

706
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:27,870
trying to do, like-- or trying
to, like, prepare your resume,

707
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,912
or

708
00:33:31,203 --> 00:33:33,438
your cover letter, or whatever
you are doing to-- for the job

709
00:33:33,438 --> 00:33:35,673
hunting

710
00:33:35,854 --> 00:33:38,733
while you are in a bad state of
mind, when you're, like, so

711
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:40,803
frustrating, it would just make
it worse, you know? And- and I

712
00:33:40,803 --> 00:33:42,873
even did

713
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:46,203
experience that. So for example,
if I got a rejection and I try

714
00:33:46,203 --> 00:33:52,114
to apply for another job, like,
the same day or something like

715
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:55,129
that, I- I find myself for--
okay. For- for example, if I try

716
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:58,144
to-

717
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:02,794
to apply to- to a job, I- I will
just, like, look. And they will

718
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:05,089
say, okay, I am unqualified, you
know? I'm not good for- for

719
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:07,354
applying

720
00:34:07,354 --> 00:34:10,954
for this. So that rejection will
affect you. So what I was doing

721
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:13,743
is just, like, resting a little
bit, maybe try to focus on

722
00:34:13,743 --> 00:34:16,503
learning

723
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:20,688
new things. Yeah. That-- that's
it mainly. And-- yeah. I will

724
00:34:20,688 --> 00:34:24,873
try to

725
00:34:24,873 --> 00:34:28,000
came up with something else. I
can't [chuckles]- I can't think

726
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,594
of any right now.

727
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,699
Bekah: I love that. I think that
it can be really hard to take a

728
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:36,087
rest and then what you do is
just burn yourself out during

729
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:38,176
the job search. And that idea of
learning something new I think

730
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,264
is really

731
00:34:40,264 --> 00:34:43,143
good. Because you also start to
feel like stagnant when all

732
00:34:43,143 --> 00:34:46,083
you're doing is applying for
jobs and so you're not learning.

733
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,634
And there's-- I don't wanna say
a balance cuz I don't know that

734
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:52,744
there can be balance when you're
interviewing for a role. But it-

735
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:54,974
it helps to keep your morale up,
I think, a little bit when you

736
00:34:54,974 --> 00:34:56,579
can

737
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:00,119
see like, "Hey, I did this thing
today and now I know something

738
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:02,234
new," versus, "I did these
interviews today and I didn't

739
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,349
get a job,"

740
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:08,039
which feels bad. So you gotta,
like, fill up that win bucket a

741
00:35:06,194 --> 00:35:09,914
little bit somehow, and it's
often not going to be through

742
00:35:09,914 --> 00:35:11,789
interviewing.

743
00:35:12,813 --> 00:35:17,344
Reda: Yeah. I was also, like, in
the meanwhile, like,

744
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:24,813
preparing for quizzes for
interview questions. So it was--

745
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:29,134
I think that the hardest part in
this part of the journey is to-

746
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:34,474
to, as you said, is to have a
balance between learning, and

747
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:38,884
applying for roles, and, like,
studying for interviews. It's-

748
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:45,500
it's- it's just a mess
[chuckles]. But one thing also

749
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,954
that helps me is

750
00:35:46,983 --> 00:35:48,798
the community, again. So being
inside the community, you see

751
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:50,613
that

752
00:35:50,614 --> 00:35:52,923
there are a lot of people like
you, you know? And the moment

753
00:35:52,923 --> 00:35:55,232
they got

754
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:57,948
the-- their first job or they
got the-- anyway, when- when-

755
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:00,663
when they--

756
00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:04,233
when they get their, like, the--
their dream job or whatever,

757
00:36:04,384 --> 00:36:07,563
it's- it's, like, kind of a
motivation to you. So, again,

758
00:36:08,884 --> 00:36:12,423
[chuckles] finding community is,
like, the-- was the key.

759
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:17,744
Bekah: Yeah, I think that's so
important. And so, how did you

760
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:20,023
end up landing the job that
you're currently at now?

761
00:36:21,184 --> 00:36:25,300
Reda: Yeah. I- I consider
myself, like, lucky [chuckles],

762
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,583
I guess. So I- I

763
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:34,533
didn't actually apply for the
job I am currently at right now.

764
00:36:34,563 --> 00:36:40,700
So they find me through GitHub.
They, like-- they put, like, a

765
00:36:41,554 --> 00:36:41,554
query search

766
00:36:41,554 --> 00:36:43,879
there. So, you know, GitHub have
this- this query search, you

767
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:46,204
know? So

768
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,000
you can put queries and you can,
like, search for- for some

769
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,253
criteria, you

770
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:56,103
know? And I was-- yeah, again, I
was lucky that I was part of

771
00:36:56,103 --> 00:37:01,849
those people. So they contact me
on LinkedIn-- ah, sorry. I-

772
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:04,000
I was lucky that I was part of
the result of the search

773
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,548
[laughs]. Yeah. So,

774
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:10,393
they contact me, like, on
LinkedIn, and they said, "Hi, we

775
00:37:10,393 --> 00:37:13,098
find your

776
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:16,500
profile interesting, and we
would like to talk about the

777
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,989
...," yeah. So I

778
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:22,000
said, "Okay, we can talk." We-
we, like, schedule, like, a

779
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,728
meeting. I

780
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:25,113
thought it was just a meeting to
talk about, like, how things

781
00:37:25,113 --> 00:37:27,498
will

782
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:29,163
go, you know? What's they're
looking for, what they are, and

783
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,828
so

784
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:36,000
on. But it turns out, like, it's
an interview and [laughs]--

785
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,458
yeah. But it was

786
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:40,398
pretty much smooth. They- they
were, like, cool people. It was

787
00:37:40,398 --> 00:37:47,398
pretty much smooth because-
because I-- when I asked how,

788
00:37:47,403 --> 00:37:49,495
like, they choose me, actually
they said, like, they- they-

789
00:37:49,495 --> 00:37:51,587
they went

790
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:54,168
through the code, actually, you
know? They went through my code,

791
00:37:54,168 --> 00:38:00,918
they went through my projects.
So I think that the process of

792
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:05,000
hiring is- [chuckles] is the
main cause why I- I am where I

793
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,128
am right now. Yeah.

794
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:11,794
So I-- it's may not be the- the
case for- for everyone, but just

795
00:38:11,794 --> 00:38:16,219
put

796
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:19,219
yourself out there, you know? If
you have any projects, even if

797
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:21,604
they are small or if they are,
like, really not that

798
00:38:21,604 --> 00:38:23,989
interesting.

799
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:26,179
I don't wanna say that they're
not interesting but just put

800
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,159
your

801
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,929
projects out there. Put them on
Twitter, GitHub, everywhere.

802
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:36,648
And-- yeah. That's it. So--
anyway, sorry, I [laughs]--

803
00:38:38,298 --> 00:38:38,688
Bekah: Don't be sorry.

804
00:38:38,688 --> 00:38:43,309
Reda: Yep. So after the
interview, I-- they actually,

805
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:47,268
like, just sends me the- the
offer. Yeah.

806
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:47,898
Bekah: Wow.

807
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:50,749
Reda: Yeah, it was pretty-- so
they-- it was kinda like the-

808
00:38:50,749 --> 00:38:52,864
the moment

809
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:54,156
they contact me, they already
made their mind that they're

810
00:38:54,156 --> 00:38:55,443
gonna

811
00:38:55,443 --> 00:39:01,474
hire me. So it was just about if
I say yes or no. So-- yeah.

812
00:39:02,378 --> 00:39:05,378
Bekah: That's awesome. Is it a
company in your country?

813
00:39:06,393 --> 00:39:08,028
Reda: Yeah, it's in my country
but it's remote. It's 100%

814
00:39:08,028 --> 00:39:09,663
remote.

815
00:39:09,963 --> 00:39:13,744
So yeah. It was actually too
good to be true. So [laughs]--

816
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:17,800
Bekah: [Chuckles] I almost [??]
like- like the idea of a

817
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,313
surprise interview cuz

818
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:20,423
then you're not really nervous
if you just think that you're

819
00:39:20,423 --> 00:39:21,533
going

820
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:23,000
in to talk to them and then
they're [chuckles] like, "Oh,

821
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,700
surprise interview." And you're
like, "Well, I didn't have the

822
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,042
last three days to panic. So I
guess, here I am." Like

823
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:28,384
[laughs]--

824
00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:31,804
Reda: Yeah, yeah. But- but it-
it wasn't any hard, you know? It

825
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:35,373
was more of a discussion than an
interview, you know? But it- it-

826
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:39,000
it was, like, the first and the
final [laughs]. So it's-- it

827
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,873
was pretty much good.

828
00:39:39,903 --> 00:39:43,533
Because I had-- previously, I
had some pretty much bad

829
00:39:43,534 --> 00:39:46,700
experience with going through
three interviews and in the end

830
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,809
getting, like, rejected. So--
[chuckles] yeah.

831
00:39:52,074 --> 00:39:54,500
Bekah: Do you-- did you find,
like, living in Morocco, that

832
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,000
the job search was even more
challenging if you were looking

833
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,213
for remote work?

834
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:05,719
Reda: It was more challenging
for me because I didn't have--

835
00:40:06,168 --> 00:40:09,768
I didn't have a degree, you
know? I didn't have a degree in

836
00:40:09,768 --> 00:40:12,648
computer science. I have a
degree in marine mechanics, but

837
00:40:12,648 --> 00:40:14,898
not in computer science. And in
Morocco, it's- it's kinda-- I

838
00:40:14,898 --> 00:40:17,148
di- I wasn't

839
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:22,068
even applying for jobs in
Morocco because I thought it's-

840
00:40:22,278 --> 00:40:24,000
it's impossible for me to get a
job here.

841
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,300
Bekah: Wow.

842
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,014
Reda: As most of companies, they

843
00:40:26,014 --> 00:40:30,393
are, like, asking for a degree,
you know? And the funny thing

844
00:40:31,384 --> 00:40:33,108
is, during my interview with my
current company, the first thing

845
00:40:33,108 --> 00:40:34,832
I

846
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:36,963
said is, "I don't have a degree.
Just for information, I don't

847
00:40:36,963 --> 00:40:39,093
have

848
00:40:39,094 --> 00:40:41,268
a degree in computer science."
But surprisingly, they said

849
00:40:41,268 --> 00:40:43,442
like,

850
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:46,023
"What matter is talent and not,
like, a piece of paper." And

851
00:40:46,023 --> 00:40:48,603
that

852
00:40:48,603 --> 00:40:56,208
was, like-- e-even if I didn't,
like, get in the- the company,

853
00:40:56,228 --> 00:40:57,849
that was a boost for me. Yeah.

854
00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:00,414
Bekah: That's awesome.

855
00:41:00,844 --> 00:41:03,244
Dan: It's good to hear. I mean,
that- that- that aligns, I

856
00:41:03,514 --> 00:41:07,300
think, with a lot of the people
that I end up, [chuckles] you

857
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,164
know, enjoying working

858
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:10,533
for, right? The- the degrees
are-- I don't know. It's-- it

859
00:41:10,533 --> 00:41:12,902
almost

860
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,133
seems silly sometimes. I mean,
not that getting a degree is

861
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:15,363
silly.

862
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:17,461
But, like, the idea that in our
field, a degree after four

863
00:41:17,461 --> 00:41:19,553
years,

864
00:41:19,554 --> 00:41:22,000
I feel like is going to be so
out of date [chuckles] to be

865
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,213
almost-- I-- not

866
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:24,323
useless, obviously. You-- like,
in college, I think the

867
00:41:24,323 --> 00:41:25,433
important

868
00:41:25,434 --> 00:41:26,994
thing is to, like, learn how to
learn, right? That's- that's

869
00:41:26,994 --> 00:41:28,554
more--

870
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:32,753
you know? But at the same time,
somebody with a- a certain

871
00:41:32,753 --> 00:41:35,063
amount of experience is going to
have the same, if not a better,

872
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:37,824
you know, handle on all that
stuff than somebody who just-

873
00:41:38,514 --> 00:41:39,324
Reda: Yeah. Yeah.

874
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,193
Dan: -going [??] to college, you
know?

875
00:41:40,744 --> 00:41:45,273
Reda: That's- that's a good
point because that-- the current

876
00:41:45,278 --> 00:41:49,969
company, like, they told me that
they interview, like, people

877
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:52,669
with degrees and, like,
engineers, you know, like,

878
00:41:52,669 --> 00:41:55,369
before me. But the-

879
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:57,633
the only difference is I had
projects. I had, like-- I know

880
00:41:57,633 --> 00:41:59,897
how to

881
00:41:59,898 --> 00:42:02,869
search for information and how--
I know how to learn by myself.

882
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:06,183
Yeah. And, like, one of the plus
for me is that I was a

883
00:42:06,183 --> 00:42:09,017
self-taught

884
00:42:09,018 --> 00:42:14,628
developer. So they know, like,
they- they won't need-- it--

885
00:42:14,628 --> 00:42:17,778
it's just a sign that you can
learn by- by yourself, you know?

886
00:42:20,244 --> 00:42:22,793
Dan: Yeah, a hundred percent
with that. I mean, that-- that's

887
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:24,203
always-- that's always gonna be
a- a point in your favor in my

888
00:42:24,203 --> 00:42:25,613
book.

889
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:30,300
Just-- I mean, as a self-taught
developer myself [laughs], you

890
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,253
know? I mean,

891
00:42:31,253 --> 00:42:32,378
but I know-- I understand, like,
what the struggles are and,

892
00:42:32,378 --> 00:42:33,503
like,

893
00:42:33,503 --> 00:42:37,704
how much it takes to continue
through that process, you know,

894
00:42:37,704 --> 00:42:39,849
and that career. And so I--
that-- that's-- I was just glad

895
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:41,994
to hear

896
00:42:41,994 --> 00:42:43,500
that, you know [chuckles], you
found a place that- that

897
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,123
respects that sort of thing-

898
00:42:44,193 --> 00:42:44,543
Reda: Thank you, thank you.

899
00:42:44,934 --> 00:42:47,000
Dan: -because it-- it's not
always, you know, it's- it's--

900
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,204
you're not-- not

901
00:42:48,204 --> 00:42:49,958
everybody's gonna feel the same
way and-- I don't know. It's

902
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:51,712
nice

903
00:42:51,713 --> 00:42:54,293
to hear when- when that sort of
thing works out well like it has

904
00:42:54,293 --> 00:42:54,954
in your case.

905
00:42:55,693 --> 00:42:55,983
Reda: Yeah.

906
00:42:57,978 --> 00:42:59,128
Bekah: Well, Reda, we wanna
thank you for being here with us

907
00:42:59,128 --> 00:43:00,278
today.

908
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:03,998
Are there any new-- last words
of advice that you have for our

909
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,179
listeners about their job search
or being self-taught?

910
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:14,119
Reda: Yeah. Thanks for having
me. And I know, like, the- the

911
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:16,024
situation in the US — I don't
know if it's in all the world

912
00:43:16,024 --> 00:43:17,929
[??] — but it's

913
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,344
pretty much tough with the--
with all the layoffs happening--

914
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:22,759
the

915
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:27,679
layed offs happening. So-- yep.
Stay- stay strong, and you can

916
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:28,938
do it. Yeah.

917
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:33,996
Dan: Okay. Alrite. Well, cool.
Well, thank you, Reda, for

918
00:43:33,996 --> 00:43:35,391
joining us so

919
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:40,822
much and-- yeah. We will catch
everybody next week. Alrite.

920
00:43:40,822 --> 00:43:41,242
Thanks, Reda.

921
00:43:41,646 --> 00:43:41,867
Bekah: Bye.
