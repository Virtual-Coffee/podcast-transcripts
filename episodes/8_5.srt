00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:09,566
Bekah: Hello and welcome to
season eight,episode five of the

2
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:14,855
Virtual Coffee Podcast.I'm Bekah,
and this is a podcast that

3
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:19,535
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community.Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:22,385
is an intimate community of
people at all stages of their

5
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:25,024
tech journey,and they're here on
this podcast sharing their

6
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,475
stories and what they've learned,
and we are here to share it with

7
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:31,925
you.Here with me today is my
co-host,Dan.

8
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:34,685
Dan: Yo.What up Beck?How's it
going?

9
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:38,774
Bekah: It is going fantastic.
How's it going with you?

10
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:42,643
Dan: It's going great.We have
another great episode for y'all.

11
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:45,643
We are sitting down with Reda,
uh,Redas,a front-end developer

12
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:48,823
from Morocco.And um,we had a
really great talk time talking to

13
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:52,844
him.He actually started his
career in marine mechanics,uh,

14
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:56,533
which is pretty interesting.Um,
and during the pandemic,uh,

15
00:00:56,594 --> 00:00:59,893
decided to switch tracks into,
um,you know,web development and

16
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:03,194
development in general.Um,and it
was a really good time,uh,

17
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:07,034
sitting,talking with him.We,we
learned a lot about his story and

18
00:01:07,453 --> 00:01:08,384
I dunno,he's a very interesting
guy.

19
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:10,813
Bekah: Yeah,it was really
fascinating to hear like he had

20
00:01:10,813 --> 00:01:15,224
completed all of the stuff that
he needed for the marine

21
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:21,433
mechanics degree.So,and,and then
after completing that,decided to

22
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:26,353
go into coding and did the whole
self,self-taught route and what

23
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:29,983
that journey was like for him and
finding a job.You know,I think

24
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,793
that,uh,it's really fascinating
to see that career pivot

25
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,144
happening right at the pandemic
and then that journey to find the

26
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:38,743
first job.

27
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:43,004
Dan: Yeah,totally.Uh,and he's,
he's one of the fewer people I've

28
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:46,724
talked to recently who is
self-taught,but,um,didn't go the

29
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:50,444
bootcamp route,right?He,he
followed free CODEcamp and a lot

30
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:54,524
of just self-guided things.Um,
And I don't know it,it is really

31
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:58,093
great hearing from somebody who
kind of did the self-driving,you

32
00:01:58,093 --> 00:02:00,134
know,education route and.

33
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,618
Bekah: Yeah,the importance of
community as part of that,right?

34
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:07,409
Like he talked a lot about
Virtual Coffee being a part of

35
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,519
that free code camp.Lab,lab and
all of the ups and downs that you

36
00:02:11,524 --> 00:02:14,338
have as a self-taught learner and
how important it's to have

37
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:17,549
community as part of that.So I
felt like this really captured

38
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:20,549
the essence of Virtual Coffee and
what we're trying to do here.

39
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:22,468
Dan: Absolutely

40
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:25,829
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast,like we start every

41
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,998
Virtual Coffee.We introduce
ourselves with our name,where

42
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:33,688
we're from,what we do,and a
random check-in question.We hope

43
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:46,038
you enjoy this episode.Our random
check-in question today is,what

44
00:02:46,038 --> 00:02:50,658
is your third space?So the space
where you feel like you belong

45
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:54,734
something that's not home or
school.give you a second to think

46
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:59,084
about that while I do my intro.
Uh,my name is Bekah.I am

47
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:03,493
developer experience lead at Open
Source.I'm from a small town in

48
00:03:03,493 --> 00:03:09,644
Ohio,and my third space,I feel
like the woods is a good place.

49
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:12,253
It's like the woods are the
library because those have always

50
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:15,764
been places that I've loved since
I was a kid,and I could just go

51
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:21,403
like,Hike or explore or sit and
read a book for hours,and those

52
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:24,433
have always been like very
comforting spaces for me.

53
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:31,153
Dan: Nice.Yeah.Um,hi,I'm Dan.I do
front end development or

54
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:33,764
whatever,full stack development.
I don't know,I,I made a decision

55
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:37,003
earlier to just say I do full
stack,even though I don't like

56
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:41,383
that phrase,but it is,uh,more
accurate to what I do.So anyway,

57
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:47,264
uh,oh,uh,Cleveland area and,um,
yeah,I mean,I,I'd say the woods

58
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:50,834
in general as well.Uh,maybe
specifically like we have a,a,my

59
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:54,252
family has a cabin out in
Pennsylvania,But I'm really

60
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:57,641
comfortable in any,any,anywhere I
have a backpack on and,you know,

61
00:03:57,641 --> 00:04:01,812
maybe my pet,my tent with me.Um,
the woods.The woods are good.Uh,

62
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,771
for like all the reasons you
said,honestly.And exploring

63
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:09,328
especially is one of my,one of my
favorite things to do.so yeah.

64
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:12,587
And,uh,yeah,so introducing our
guest,uh,Reda,go ahead.

65
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,220
Reda: I am Reda.I am a front-end
developer based in Morocco.And,

66
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,430
uh,my third place is,I think I'll
go with the,the sea.Uh,back in

67
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,810
college,uh,I used to have this
coffee shop,it's like in front of

68
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,949
the,of the,of the beach to be
more accurate and I used to hang

69
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:34,180
out there a lot.Yeah.

70
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,189
Bekah: That sounds awesome.I love
it.Well,thanks so much Reda for

71
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,370
being here with us today.We're
happy to have you on the pa,the

72
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,980
podcast.I like went Midwestern,
the podcast.I'm from Eastern

73
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,220
Ohio.We don't say it like that
here.I apologize.Um,and we always

74
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,060
like to get started with your
origin story,so I know that you

75
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,670
have a really fascinating one.So
why don't you let us know,like

76
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,980
what you were doing before you
came into tech and what the

77
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,620
journey was like to getting your
first job.

78
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:10,891
Reda: Yeah,sure.Uh,I was in the
marine mechanics field,so like,

79
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:17,430
uh,I used to go for in the
fishing ships.Uh,but I didn't

80
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:22,456
really like,Uh,start working.I
just had training there,but like

81
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:29,266
my education was focused on that,
on the ma marine mechanics.Uh,so

82
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:37,336
during my,um,during my gradation,
the,the pandemic hit,so,yeah,uh,

83
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:40,786
it hit When I,when I was
preparing for my final projects

84
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:48,915
for the graduation,uh,my final
project was kinda like,Related to

85
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:53,776
programming?Not really,but I had
some parts of the pro programming

86
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:58,786
in it.It was kinda like,uh,a
black box to me.Uh,I didn't

87
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:04,005
really like,um,I can say this,I
was,wasn't really working on the

88
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:07,665
programming part,but I was
curious about it.So I had,I was

89
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:12,946
doing some,um,Uh,like simulation
with matlab.I don't know if

90
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:17,235
you've ever heard of that.It's
like a software for simulation,

91
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:22,755
but it,it has some stuff like
with programming in it,but I,I,I

92
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:27,975
didn't really touch it.I was just
copy paste the code there or with

93
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:34,696
it Also,I had some,uh,some
classes like in the.Some classes

94
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:41,776
back in college related to basic
algorithms and um,and I,if I

95
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:46,831
remember good c plus plus.And I
really like them.So from there,

96
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:50,850
it started like my,my passion
too,and like my interest in

97
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:57,841
programming.So after graduation,
the,I,I,I hadn't really a lot to

98
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:01,321
do because the pandemic,I'm stuck
at home.There's nothing I can do.

99
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:06,480
So I started like searching about
these things that it was like

100
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,471
just a black box for me.Uh,I
started with machine learning,

101
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:17,115
which is.Kinda like weird.It's,I
don't know,I was just looking for

102
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:21,105
something to start with,you know?
And,uh,one course on Coursera has

103
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:25,036
matlab and also like the stuff,
so I just started with machine

104
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:31,065
learning.Uh,after that,um,
machine learning,like,uh,in that

105
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:35,596
course they were using matlab,
but they,after finishing the

106
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:39,526
course,they said that like,
Python is much better.And if you

107
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:43,995
wanna like,learn more about this
stuff,you should like,uh,go with,

108
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:48,555
uh,with Python.So I started
Python after machine learning,

109
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:51,555
even though I didn't really do
anything with machine learning.

110
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,766
It was just like,out of
curiosity,just like.How things

111
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:59,836
work.Uh,I started that course on
like,Python for everybody on

112
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:04,005
Coursera.It was really good.And,
uh,the teacher is really like,

113
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:09,555
amazing.The most,like,uh,it's,
it's the,I can't remember the,

114
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,016
the name.I think Dr.Chuck,I can't
remember the name Anyway.Uh,but

115
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:19,245
the course is uh,like Python for
everybody.It was really amazing

116
00:08:19,576 --> 00:08:25,800
and.But after I finished that
course,I really didn't know what

117
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,821
to do with it.So I have the
knowledge,I have the basic

118
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:34,051
knowledge,but I have no idea what
to do with it because like Python

119
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:41,100
is more for backend and it wasn't
any visual.Like feedback for me

120
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:47,160
and they're more visual,like a
visual person.So I started like

121
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,561
to search for something like
that,has,uh,more interactivity.

122
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:56,250
So I do something and they see
the results in front of me.So

123
00:08:56,255 --> 00:09:00,870
more like a visual feedback as I
said.Yeah.And during my search,

124
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:06,181
uh,I was mainly searching for
free stuff because,uh,I,I wasn't

125
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:13,770
working,I was totally relying on
my parents.So,yeah.And,um,uh,I

126
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:19,291
found frequent camp,so frequent
camp,and from there,the,like,the

127
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:23,791
real journey started.So the,just
like the first challenge in

128
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:29,910
frequent camp,you just do like,
um,Uh,like small challenge and

129
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,331
you see the result in front of
you like in the same moment,and

130
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:36,721
that was amazing.It was like,oh,
wow,I,I did something.You know,

131
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,500
even though I spent maybe three
months on the,on the

132
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,010
specialization of Python,I never
felt the same when I,when I saw

133
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:48,541
the results in front of me.Like
in,in the same moment.Yeah.So I

134
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:54,666
finished frequent camp.And after
that I just was,uh,yeah,I was

135
00:09:54,666 --> 00:10:00,696
just like building projects.Uh,
until I got into the CoLab lab

136
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:06,875
and after the CoLab lab,I got
like my job directly after that.

137
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:09,216
Like after finishing the CoLab
lab?Yeah.

138
00:10:09,846 --> 00:10:12,515
Bekah: Awesome.Thanks so much.
It's such an interesting story to

139
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:17,826
hear that and um,that process of
where you were in university and

140
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,735
what brought you to here.I'm
curious,what kind of projects

141
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:24,456
were you working on in between
the end of Free Code Camp and

142
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:25,115
Collab Lab?

143
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:32,176
Reda: Yeah.Uh,I,I was mainly
doing like the,the frequent camp

144
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:39,076
projects because,uh,the,the
problem was in the,in frequent

145
00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:42,826
camp,it's not a problem,but it's
just more of like,uh,the hard

146
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:49,275
part on frequent camp is all the
learning is,uh,It is text based,

147
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:56,206
you know.So it was kind of like
hard to understand some parts.So

148
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:59,355
I was like going to look on
YouTube and on different blog

149
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,546
posts and so on,and like keep,
like revising what I was doing

150
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:09,015
before.And then I back to the,to
the projects on the frequent

151
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:12,885
camp.So I did the projects on
Free boot camp and then I was

152
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:17,716
looking for,uh,like projects on
YouTube,projects on,you know,

153
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:24,135
but,but that's the.That's
tutorial hell.So,yeah.Uh,it was

154
00:11:24,135 --> 00:11:28,995
pretty much hard to get out of
it.It's,uh,the hardest part was,

155
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:32,686
uh,the hardest part was when you
just look at the screen and you

156
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:37,515
don't know,like from where to
start,but the built end projects

157
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:41,775
in frequent camp where pretty
much like they,they give you the.

158
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:45,166
What you have to do,you know,
like steps they don't give you

159
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:49,245
like what you have to do,but
what's you are supposed to do.So

160
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:54,076
like the,the steps of the,the
process.So my projects mainly

161
00:11:54,076 --> 00:12:00,166
were frequent camp projects,plus
some YouTube tutorials and so on.

162
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:06,285
And then,uh,I was like trying to
improve the,the projects I worked

163
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:10,620
on.So that's what I was doing.I
was like,uh,going in some areas

164
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,471
that I didn't touch during
frequent camp,like testing,

165
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,291
accessibility and so on.
Accessibility was covered in

166
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:20,880
frequent camp,but testing wasn't.
And I also was feeling like the

167
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,900
gaps because,uh,uh,I,I did,you
can say it's one of my mistakes

168
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:33,990
when I was learning is the,that I
was trying to be fast to be like,

169
00:12:34,905 --> 00:12:38,745
Just finish this,finish this,
finish this,and go on.And that

170
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:44,145
like left like some gaps in the
fundamentals.So yeah,projects

171
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:47,446
will help you fill out that kind
of gaps.I think I didn't really

172
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:50,625
answer your question,but uh,
yeah.

173
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:53,051
Bekah: I think you definitely
answered the question,and I

174
00:12:53,056 --> 00:12:56,321
think,um,that's really important,
that idea of going through too

175
00:12:56,321 --> 00:13:01,150
fast and having those learning
gaps.And,um,I think that I also,

176
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,841
I went to bootcamp and it took me
a year,but I,you know,I was

177
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:08,515
working at a slower pace and.I
still think it was a little bit

178
00:13:08,515 --> 00:13:12,775
too fast for me too,and I did.I
had done a full stack program

179
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:18,235
after doing a portion of free
code camp,and there was just so

180
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:22,721
much material to get through in
that time period,so,But I

181
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:26,081
wondered,I was like,ready to move
on to the next phase of my life.

182
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:29,711
Right?Like ready to get a job.
And I,I remember thinking

183
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,890
afterwards like,oh,once I get
done with this,it's gonna be

184
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,941
easy.And like,I don't know why I
thought that,but then you start

185
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:42,100
your first job,you're like,oh,
that was the easy part.And now

186
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,311
I've hit the hard part.And I
don't know if that resonates with

187
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:48,576
you or your ex.Experience in
collab lab,maybe filled in some

188
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:51,785
of those gaps and helped with
that,but I'm curious if,if you

189
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:53,466
had any of that experience too.

190
00:13:54,635 --> 00:14:01,551
Reda: Yeah.Uh,I learned a lot,
like mainly I learned how to

191
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:04,910
collaborate because being a soft
developer are working by

192
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:10,490
yourself.Like100%by yourself.So
you don't know how to use like,

193
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,571
not really how to use GitHub,but
how to use some futures of

194
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:17,630
GitHub.So you don't know how to
open a polar request.You don't

195
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:23,030
know how to fix conflicts.You
don't know how you,yeah,you got

196
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:28,490
me.So,yeah,actually like the
Virtual Coffee,like,uh,

197
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:32,615
Octoberfest challenge already
helps me with GitHub like.I got

198
00:14:32,615 --> 00:14:37,326
familiar with GitHub a little bit
and I make some contribution,but

199
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:41,166
it's different on the CoLab lab
because you are working,like for

200
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:44,916
over two months you are
collaborating with three people

201
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:48,995
and you have mentors also,like
they are helping you

202
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:53,475
Bekah: what you said also really
resonated with me because,uh,I

203
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,995
went to a bootcamp,but it was
self-paced,so I wasn't working

204
00:14:55,995 --> 00:15:00,855
with other people either.And I
remember,um,so for anybody that

205
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,524
doesn't know,Dan was the first
person to hire me out of

206
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:06,315
bootcamp.And we were like going
through all of this stuff.And

207
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:10,860
actually it was four years ago,I
think I started.July1st.Um,

208
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:18,480
anyway,um,side,side note.Um,but
it,I remember he,he was walking

209
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,279
me through it.He was like,yeah,
you just worked through the issue

210
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,080
and then when you're done,you
create a pool request.And I was

211
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,000
like,okay.And I know what a pool
request is.I've done that once or

212
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,350
twice,but like now I'm like,
okay,that seems like something

213
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,850
that's really basic.But even in
bootcamp,I was working on my own

214
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:41,159
projects and so I wasn't making
pool requests.I.I once,so when I

215
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:45,299
built my first website,it was,
uh,my blogs.Okay.And so I'm

216
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:48,240
writing these blogs,but I didn't
even know that you could run it

217
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,539
locally.And so I was just like
pushing everything live and then

218
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:54,899
looking at it,seeing what worked
and what didn't.And then like

219
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,139
recommitting,I actually all that
commit history is still there.So

220
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:03,690
anybody can go and,and see what.
What that process was like.It,it

221
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,860
was a lot of like the basics,
what,what I would see now as

222
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,029
basics of writing,commit
messages,um,committing

223
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:16,049
frequently,running things locally
to test it before it goes live

224
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:20,580
and pool requests,like none of
that stuff was natural to me

225
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,389
after that experience or really
emphasized as part of the

226
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:27,690
process.And you were talking
about free code camp because

227
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,110
you're not really making pool
requests there and.Even when I

228
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:34,769
did the projects,I was doing them
in code pen and,and so there's

229
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:39,029
not branches or any concept of
that kind of stuff,and that's

230
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,490
integral to being able to work as
part of a team.

231
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:47,080
Reda: Yeah.I,I have this funny,
like the same issue.It's funny

232
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,639
because,uh,I was working most of
my projects like in frequent camp

233
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:58,884
at first,like on.So,uh,after like
the first time I wanted to like,

234
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:04,944
uh,do my project locally,I didn't
know how to do it.So,yeah,that's

235
00:17:04,944 --> 00:17:07,974
also part of like,feeling gap.
It's,it's the very,very of the

236
00:17:07,974 --> 00:17:13,464
basics,but it's,uh,you,uh,it's,
it's hard when you're a self

237
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:18,954
study.You just don't know where
to go.It's,uh,like you,you don't

238
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:24,730
have a plan,you know?Uh,frequent
camp make it easier.Uh,but still

239
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,509
there,there are some gaps.There
are some gaps that you just,uh,

240
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,170
don't know.Like you,you don't
even know them to fix them,you

241
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:38,410
know?But Yeah.But when you are
like,uh,interaction with other

242
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:44,440
people.So here it comes,the rules
of communities and,um,CoLab lab,

243
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,529
Virtual Coffee.Uh,when you're
interacting with people,you see

244
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,990
their problems,you see what they
are doing,and you're learning

245
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,940
from them,and you got some
guidance.

246
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,609
Bekah: Yeah,I feel like I also
formed some bad habits during

247
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:00,299
that time period because I was
just working by myself,and so I

248
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:04,589
didn't know that there were other
ways of doing things,so,Um,and

249
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:07,680
that was also something that I
had to kind of navigate and work

250
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,900
through,and I don't know if you
had that experience as well,so.

251
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:15,684
Reda: Yeah,yeah,yeah.The same
here.Uh,it was a lot of things

252
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:18,954
that you do.For example,I,I
didn't even know that you can

253
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:24,640
fork.You know,so I was like,if I
wanted to do something with her,

254
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,329
I would just try to push directly
to it.It doesn't matter if,if

255
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:34,299
it's mine or if it's someone's
projects.So,yeah.Yeah.It,it,it

256
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,039
also like,uh,when you are coding,
uh,you don't know if what you are

257
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,109
doing is the right way,you know,
or if it's the best way and so

258
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:44,433
on.

259
00:18:45,193 --> 00:18:48,673
Dan: Totally.I,there's so many
valuable aspects of having,you

260
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:51,223
know,working together on a team
with some people,uh,even if

261
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:54,374
you're,or,or just having extra
eyes on it.Right,right.Like,like

262
00:18:54,523 --> 00:18:57,253
you were saying,you,you just
don't know.You can hope that you,

263
00:18:57,253 --> 00:18:59,983
whatever you're doing is the best
way,you know,but,um,having,

264
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:04,933
having extra people,it's just
always so valuable.Um,and as far

265
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:08,534
as,you know,uh,some of the open
source stuff,you know,like

266
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:13,088
forking,right?Like I have been
working on,on GitHub in my.Like

267
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:17,648
small team for work for years
before I ever forked any

268
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:20,409
repositories,right?Because if
you're on,if you're in an

269
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,898
organization you don't need
necessarily to fork,you know,

270
00:19:22,903 --> 00:19:25,538
create your own forks,you,you,
you just create branches and do

271
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:27,669
that stuff.So I was comfortable
with that,but I had not,not like

272
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:32,023
ever done,um,that whole flow
right,until honestly,until.I

273
00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:34,334
mean,I think I'd done it a little
bit before Virtual Coffee,but uh,

274
00:19:34,364 --> 00:19:37,933
really,you know,actually
understood it much better once we

275
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:39,943
got into Virtual Coffee and
started doing some of those open

276
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:43,273
source contributions.And yeah,
there's just,there's just,uh,

277
00:19:43,304 --> 00:19:46,784
when you're,when you're by
yourself as a solo person,it can

278
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:50,683
be fun and it can be interesting.
But,uh,yeah,I always had that

279
00:19:50,683 --> 00:19:54,013
sense.I'm sure there's something
missing.I'm sure there's some,

280
00:19:54,074 --> 00:19:56,594
you know,some pieces that I'm,
I'm not seeing or,or whatever.

281
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:59,953
And it's,it's just so nice to be
able to have,um,other people are

282
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:02,804
like hanging around and,and,and,
you know,working together,uh,on

283
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:03,193
things.

284
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:08,034
Reda: Yeah,I think that the first
repo I for was original coffee

285
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:09,683
like repo.Yeah.

286
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:12,493
Dan: a good one.

287
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:17,159
Bekah: and that's one of the
reasons why our documentation for

288
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,628
Virtual Coffee,um,to contribute
is very thorough.Like maybe it's

289
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:25,019
a little bit too thorough,I'm not
sure,but because a lot of the

290
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:28,078
people that are contributing are
in the same situation that we

291
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:32,648
have both been in where.We don't
have that experience of forking

292
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,669
or what is a commit?How do you
create a branch?And just to make

293
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,939
sure that we're able to support
those people as part of that

294
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:43,298
process and decrease the friction
for people to be able to

295
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:47,348
contribute,I think is really
important.Um,and,and the same

296
00:20:47,354 --> 00:20:51,709
thing goes for people.Um,who have
been working for years,but like

297
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:55,098
Dan said,they,they don't have to
fork anything.I just taught an

298
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:59,388
intro to open source workshop a
couple of weeks ago and I had to

299
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,118
talk about forking a repository.
And so I like went through and I

300
00:21:02,124 --> 00:21:05,479
practiced because I honestly
don't know when the last time I

301
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:11,028
had to fork a repository was.Um,
and,and it is those little things

302
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:16,699
that become really important.Um,
And so I wanted to know,uh,this

303
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:20,719
is like my very longwinded way of
saying,you talked about this open

304
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:23,868
source experience that you had
and you participated October.

305
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:28,219
You're,you're rocking your
octoberfest dirt today,um,which

306
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:31,818
is awesome.Um,but can you talk a
little bit about where that was

307
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:34,788
at in your journey and what kinds
of things that you were able to

308
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:36,588
accomplish during that hack Tober
Fest.

309
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:44,949
Reda: Yeah,sure.Uh,it's,uh,it's
actually was like after finishing

310
00:21:44,949 --> 00:21:50,618
like frequent camp.It's,uh,I,I
was in a,okay,this is like,uh,

311
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:55,538
Just like,uh,side story.It's not
like really answering the

312
00:21:55,538 --> 00:22:01,568
question.So the,I I was pretty
much desperate after finishing

313
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:09,068
frequent camp.Uh,I had H G M L,
CSS Knowledge,basic Knowledge.I

314
00:22:09,098 --> 00:22:15,788
had JavaScript knowledge,but I
didn't know how to connect.Like

315
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:20,949
between them.I,I had no idea how,
okay,there is HTML says there is

316
00:22:21,068 --> 00:22:26,259
JavaScript,but I had no idea how
to use both of them.And,uh,on

317
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:29,558
frequent Canvas it wasn't there
anything.Also,you know,so,uh,

318
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:33,999
after JavaScript there is
directly react,uh,actually front

319
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:38,439
end libraries.So I,I was lost.I
was totally lost.I was desperate.

320
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:43,808
And at that moment I was actually
thinking to give up because,uh,

321
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:48,324
You know,uh,imposter syndrome.I
was thinking that I'm low and I

322
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:53,213
don't know how to do things.So I,
I was thinking maybe like,it's

323
00:22:53,213 --> 00:22:56,513
not for me,you know,even though
it has nothing to do with me,I

324
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:59,243
just like something,you know,
there is something missing and I

325
00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:03,683
don't know about it.So I posted
in the frequent camp Forum about

326
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:09,023
it.So I,I said,I,I literally said
like,uh,I am done.I'm about to

327
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:13,824
give up and,uh,I don't know what
to do next.I have no idea.And

328
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:16,584
people there were very
supportive.You know,they,thanks

329
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:20,753
for them by the way.They were,
they were very supportive.Uh,and

330
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:25,223
they told me like,you just need
this,the,the document objects

331
00:23:25,223 --> 00:23:31,644
model done so you can like,uh,
for manipulating like the HTML

332
00:23:31,648 --> 00:23:37,689
documents and the browser
document and so on.So,uh,And why

333
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:42,398
I'm telling you this story is
because at that same trade,uh,

334
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:47,409
Jessica told me about Virtual
Coffee.And when I joined Virtual

335
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:52,088
Coffee after that,directly,like
you were doing the October f uh,

336
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:55,929
the Octoberfest,uh,like
challenge.And from there I got

337
00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:00,308
some energy.Yeah.Uh,I,I,I,I did
something and like I was,yeah,

338
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:05,874
I'm,I'm able to do this.I can do
this.Uh,so.Back to the

339
00:24:05,874 --> 00:24:13,074
Octoberfest story.Well,yeah.So
for Octoberfest,I had,uh,I had a

340
00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:19,344
mentor assigned,uh,Justin.Uh,he
was pretty much helpful.He told,

341
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:24,384
like,he told me a lot of stuff
about,uh,like,uh,comments,how to

342
00:24:24,384 --> 00:24:27,864
fork,how to set up a stream.Just
lots of information.I don't

343
00:24:27,864 --> 00:24:32,003
remember that.I was like,Okay.
This is,this is exciting,you

344
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:36,354
know,exciting and the same time
scary.Oh,I didn't know all of

345
00:24:36,354 --> 00:24:43,554
that.I didn't know anything.So,
yeah,uh,he was like,uh,he taught

346
00:24:43,554 --> 00:24:47,574
me all of that stuff and like,
give me some resources to,to

347
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:53,304
search for,uh,open source
projects.Uh,but the hardest part

348
00:24:53,304 --> 00:24:57,669
about that is finding issues.
That's was the Yeah,and that's

349
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:01,628
an,that's another thing.So when
you don't find issues or you,

350
00:25:01,628 --> 00:25:04,419
there,there is,there are issues,
but the most of them you don't

351
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:09,608
like,you don't know how to do
them.So I,I,I got like,uh,

352
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:15,098
frustrated again.So I don't like
it's,uh,you think that's,it's you

353
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:19,433
who don't know anything,but
actually the.Uh,the tech industry

354
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:22,943
is pretty,like,much bored.You
know,there,there are a lot of

355
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:26,003
stocks,there are a lot of things
that you don't know,of course.

356
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:34,584
Uh,so,um,yeah,after that I was
like searching for things.

357
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:40,554
That's,I know,I know how to do.
Uh,so I was searching for some

358
00:25:40,554 --> 00:25:44,933
issues.I found like some,like
small projects there,they were,

359
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:48,564
maybe they were also learners.
They weren't like,like a big,um,

360
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:52,344
companies or anything.Maybe they
were also learners or something

361
00:25:52,348 --> 00:26:00,503
like that.Uh,so,uh,I,uh,I found
this vault project.Like people

362
00:26:00,503 --> 00:26:04,044
that own that small projects.And
I worked on small issues,for

363
00:26:04,044 --> 00:26:08,003
example,adding local storage to,
uh,to do up,it was something out

364
00:26:08,003 --> 00:26:13,523
of my comfort zone,but also like,
uh,I know I,I,I know that I can

365
00:26:13,523 --> 00:26:20,183
do it,you know?Uh,so I did some
of those issues and I also did

366
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:26,544
one maybe for Virtual Coffee or
two.I can't remember.Yeah,but

367
00:26:26,604 --> 00:26:31,673
that actually boost my,my like
self-confidence,you know,I,I can

368
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:35,394
do stuff and,and,and that's what
I was lucky in before when I was

369
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:42,503
just by myself.Like every time,
um,every time I don't know how to

370
00:26:42,503 --> 00:26:49,223
do something or I'm blaming
myself.And,and that was like,uh,

371
00:26:49,614 --> 00:26:52,314
the darkest point.Yeah.

372
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,719
Dan: I think,uh,any developer
who's been developing for.An

373
00:26:57,719 --> 00:27:00,449
amount of time has gone through
those,those,those times.I know I

374
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:05,098
have a bunch of times over my
career and I,I thi I mean,I'm

375
00:27:05,098 --> 00:27:07,078
glad,I just wanna say thank you
for sharing that because it's,

376
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:10,679
it's,it's good for people to hear
because,uh,especially when you

377
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,679
are like,like a lot of us are at
the beginning kind of by

378
00:27:13,683 --> 00:27:17,278
yourselves and on your own.It can
be hard to know that that sort of

379
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:20,848
thing is pretty common.I feel
like that feeling of,of,I don't

380
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,038
know how to do this.I don't know
how to do anything,you know,um,

381
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:29,699
is un.Unfortunately,I,I guess,
uh,part of this,part of this like

382
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:33,808
world,uh,as far as I can tell,
and from my own experience and my

383
00:27:33,808 --> 00:27:38,098
experience of,um,most of my
friends,it,it's like you just

384
00:27:38,098 --> 00:27:41,068
come across those those times,
you know?And I think it's a sign,

385
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:43,199
honestly.It's a sign that you're
pushing yourself,you know,and

386
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,409
trying to learn more.And I think
it's in general a good sign,

387
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:51,973
although it's not ever fun.When
you're in the middle of it,uh,I

388
00:27:51,973 --> 00:27:53,594
think it's,I think it's a good
sign because it means you're,

389
00:27:53,598 --> 00:27:56,594
you're,um,you know,you're
learning,right?And you're trying

390
00:27:56,594 --> 00:27:58,903
things that you don't know
necessarily how to do at the

391
00:27:58,903 --> 00:28:02,864
beginning.Um,and that's,that's
something that,that by myself,

392
00:28:02,864 --> 00:28:06,163
I've,I've run into as well as I
realized that I'm just like,have

393
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:09,013
been very comfortable for a long
time,you know,and just doing the

394
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:12,953
same things.And some of it is a
little bit boring,but.Like,

395
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:15,263
there's a little bit of boredom
that sits in,but it's mostly just

396
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:18,324
this sense.Again,it's that sense,
you know,that you were talking

397
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:22,824
about where you know that there's
something out there that you

398
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:24,804
probably could be doing better or
probably could be doing

399
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:28,193
differently or,uh,anything like
that.And it,and for me,it kind of

400
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:33,074
creeps up on me.Um,But then you,
once you start like stretching

401
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:35,443
out again,you are risk run,the
risk of running into those

402
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:38,653
feelings again.So it's,it's a
never ending cycle,you know?But,

403
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:43,034
uh,I think it's a healthy one,
uh,in general.Um,and I think it

404
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:46,064
sounds like the ways that you've
gotten through it are good in

405
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:48,884
healthy ways,you know,to do it.
Um,you know,finding communities

406
00:28:48,888 --> 00:28:52,814
and finding people to work with
and,um,everything like that.

407
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:56,229
Reda: Fi finding inspiration
also,like,uh,there are some

408
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:59,348
people in communities like that.
They,they just inspire you and

409
00:28:59,348 --> 00:29:03,848
you wanna like,be like them,you
know?Uh,that keeps you like to,

410
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:08,229
to push yourself like harder and
just to not give up.Yep.

411
00:29:08,608 --> 00:29:09,368
Dan: Yeah,absolutely.

412
00:29:11,513 --> 00:29:14,334
Bekah: Okay.So I wanna move
forward just a little bit on this

413
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:18,413
journey,cuz I know that there's,
um,okay,so you did free code

414
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:22,314
camp,you did collab lab,and then
you're interviewing for jobs.At

415
00:29:22,314 --> 00:29:26,544
what point did you decide,I'm
ready to interview for a role,

416
00:29:26,544 --> 00:29:28,794
and then what,what did that
journey look like?

417
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:36,288
Reda: Yeah.Uh,well,I would,if I,
if I wa,if I didn't join virtual

418
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:41,838
Coffee again,I would never apply
for jobs.I think I remember my

419
00:29:41,844 --> 00:29:46,459
first,uh,my first like coffee
shop was,uh,was about my,I put

420
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:50,689
the question about,uh,I asked a
question about,uh,this,about when

421
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:56,118
you are ready to apply for jobs,
and someone told me yesterday,

422
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:03,094
And,and yeah.And,and I,I that
clicked,you know,so you,you just

423
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:07,624
need to apply.You will never fail
already.It's,again,I imposter

424
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:10,864
syndrome again.Uh,you will never
fail that you're ready.You will

425
00:30:10,864 --> 00:30:15,874
never fail that you know enough
to apply for job.So,yeah.Uh,I

426
00:30:15,874 --> 00:30:22,219
think after.After like free boot
camp directly,like,um,not

427
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:25,969
directly,but after finishing some
React projects,after I had some

428
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:31,219
React knowledge,I started
applying for jobs.Uh,that's also

429
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:37,398
as a pretty much hard,it was like
the,the worst period I think,uh,

430
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:41,898
again,with frustration and,uh,
whenever you get,uh,a rejection,

431
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:49,159
I blame myself.I take it
personally,you know?Uh,Yeah.So

432
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:55,128
whenever I,I get reject,I,I just
like,uh,drop everything for two

433
00:30:55,134 --> 00:30:59,868
days,two,three days.I just drop
everything and do nothing because

434
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:04,969
it was like hard on me,you know?
Uh,because,uh,you,you kinda,you

435
00:31:04,973 --> 00:31:09,648
don't know if the part you choose
is correct,you know,there is

436
00:31:09,648 --> 00:31:13,338
this,this,this doubt about will
you ever,will you ever be able to

437
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:19,878
do it,you know?Uh,there is also
like the,the,the society like

438
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:25,608
oppression.You know,you are,you
are like,uh,without a job.You,

439
00:31:26,209 --> 00:31:29,328
you studied and you are doing
nothing.It's not nothing.You are

440
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:32,659
like,you are actually like
studying another thing.But what

441
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:37,098
there is always that question,
what if I failed?You know?And

442
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:42,199
rejections always remind me of,
uh,of failing,you know,of the

443
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:49,433
end.If.If,maybe if,uh,if,if it
wasn't like the,the right part,

444
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:56,124
if,uh,all what I was doing is
just how I can say it.Yeah.I

445
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:56,844
guess you got me.

446
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:02,229
Bekah: Oh.I definitely get that
and I even when I was laid off

447
00:32:02,229 --> 00:32:07,554
earlier this year,It was such a
weird space to be in.I'd never

448
00:32:07,554 --> 00:32:10,223
been laid off before and I was
like,I don't know,maybe I should

449
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:13,763
just not be in tech.Like maybe
this isn't for me.You know?And,

450
00:32:14,243 --> 00:32:20,453
um,it really messes with your
head.I think when you start to

451
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:24,294
second guess yourself and,and you
feel that rejection in some way,

452
00:32:24,294 --> 00:32:27,354
whether or not,you know,I went
through layoffs.They said it was

453
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:31,614
restructuring or whatever.Uh,so
there was nothing that implied

454
00:32:31,614 --> 00:32:35,844
like,You did a bad job,so you got
fired,right?Um,or maybe the

455
00:32:35,844 --> 00:32:40,824
pandemic hits and you lose your
job for a little while.But,um,

456
00:32:40,913 --> 00:32:45,534
it,no matter what,all of those
things still feel,they don't feel

457
00:32:45,534 --> 00:32:49,403
good and they make you question
like,is this the right place for

458
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:53,394
me?And so can you talk a little
bit more about how you've

459
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:55,973
navigated those frustrations?
Cause I know it's really hard out

460
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:59,423
there for job seekers now,
especially for folks looking for

461
00:32:59,423 --> 00:33:01,374
their first job in tech.

462
00:33:02,374 --> 00:33:08,374
Reda: Yeah,sure.Uh,I mainly was
like,uh,taking breast,as I said

463
00:33:08,374 --> 00:33:12,888
before,like I.If,I don't know if
this is,if this is really the

464
00:33:12,888 --> 00:33:17,868
good way to go,but,uh,I was doing
that,I was taking rest or so for

465
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:21,348
a day,for two days.I just don't
do anything just to,to get to

466
00:33:21,354 --> 00:33:24,828
myself,you know,because,uh,
trying to learn new things or

467
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:30,913
trying to do.Like,or trying to
like,uh,prepare your resume or

468
00:33:31,203 --> 00:33:35,673
your cover letter or whatever you
are doing to,for the job hunting

469
00:33:35,854 --> 00:33:38,733
while you are in a bad state of
mind when you're like,so

470
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:42,874
frustrating,it would just make it
worse,you know?Uh,and I even did

471
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:46,203
experience that.So for example,
if I got a rejection and I try

472
00:33:46,203 --> 00:33:52,114
to,uh,apply for another job like
the same day or something like

473
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:58,144
that,I,I find myself for.Uh,
okay.For,for example,if I try to,

474
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:02,794
to apply to,to a job,I,I will
just like look and they will say,

475
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:07,354
okay,I am unqualified,you know,
uh,I'm not good for,for applying

476
00:34:07,354 --> 00:34:10,954
for this.So that rejection will
affect you.So what I was doing is

477
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:16,503
just like resting a little bit,
maybe try to focus on learning

478
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:24,873
new things.Uh,yeah,that,that's it
mainly.And,um,yeah.I will try to

479
00:34:24,873 --> 00:34:29,393
come up with something else.I
can't,I can't think of any right

480
00:34:29,393 --> 00:34:29,594
now.

481
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,699
Bekah: I love that.I think that
it can be really hard to take a

482
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:36,088
rest,and then what you do is just
burn yourself out during the job

483
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:40,264
search and.That idea of learning
something new I think is really

484
00:34:40,264 --> 00:34:43,143
good because you also start to
feel like stagnant when all

485
00:34:43,143 --> 00:34:46,083
you're doing is applying for
jobs.And so you're not learning

486
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,634
and there's,I don't wanna say a
balance cuz I don't know that

487
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:52,744
there can be balance when you're
interviewing for a role.But,um,

488
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:56,579
It helps to keep your morale up,
I think a little bit when you can

489
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:00,119
see like,Hey,I did this thing
today and now I know something

490
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,349
new versus,I did these interviews
today and I didn't get a job,

491
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:08,039
which feels bad.So you gotta like
fill up that win bucket a little

492
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,789
bit somehow.And it's often not
going to be through interviewing.

493
00:35:12,813 --> 00:35:17,344
Reda: Yeah.Uh,I was also like,
uh,in the meanwhile like

494
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:24,813
preparing for quizzes for
interview questions.Uh,so it was,

495
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:29,134
I think that the hardest part in
this part of the journey is to,

496
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:34,474
to,as you said,is to have a
balance between learning and

497
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:38,884
applying for roles and like
studying for interviews.it's,

498
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:46,954
It's It's just a mess.But,uh,uh,
one thing also that helps me is

499
00:35:46,983 --> 00:35:50,614
the community again.So being
inside the community,you see that

500
00:35:50,614 --> 00:35:55,233
there are a lot of people like,
you know,and the moment they got

501
00:35:55,233 --> 00:36:00,664
the,their first job or they got
the anyway,when,when,when they,

502
00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:04,233
when they get their,like the,
their dream job or whatever.

503
00:36:04,384 --> 00:36:07,563
It's,it's like kind of a
motivation to you.So again,

504
00:36:08,884 --> 00:36:12,423
Finding,uh,community is like,was
key.

505
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:17,744
Bekah: Yeah,I think that's so
important.And so how did you end

506
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:20,023
up landing the job that you're
currently at now?

507
00:36:21,184 --> 00:36:29,583
Reda: Yeah.I,I consider myself
like lucky,I guess.Uh,so I,I

508
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:34,534
didn't actually apply for the job
I am currently at right now,so

509
00:36:34,563 --> 00:36:41,554
they find me to GitHub.They like,
uh,they put like a Q research

510
00:36:41,554 --> 00:36:46,204
there,so you know,GitHub have
this,this Q research,you know,so

511
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:50,253
you can put QEs and you can like
search for,for some criteria,you

512
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:56,103
know,and uh,I was,yeah,I can,I
was lucky that I was part of

513
00:36:56,103 --> 00:37:01,849
those people.Uh,so they contact
me on LinkedIn.Uh,sorry.I I was

514
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:07,548
lucky that I was part of the
result of the search.Yeah.So,uh,

515
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:13,099
they contact me like on LinkedIn
and they said,hi,uh,we find your

516
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:17,989
profile interest and we would
like to talk about the,yeah.So I

517
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:22,728
said,okay,we can talk.We,we like
schedule like,uh,a meeting.I

518
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:27,498
thought it was just a meeting to
talk about like how.Things will

519
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:30,829
go,you know,what's they're
looking for,what they are,and so

520
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:37,458
on.But it turns out like it's an
interview and yeah,but it was

521
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:40,398
pretty much smooth.They,they were
like cool people.It was pretty

522
00:37:40,398 --> 00:37:47,398
much smooth because,uh,uh,
because I,uh,when I asked how,

523
00:37:47,403 --> 00:37:51,588
like they choose me,actually they
said like they,they,they went

524
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:54,168
through the code.Actually,you
know,they went through my code,

525
00:37:54,168 --> 00:38:00,918
they went through my.Projects.So
I think that the process of

526
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:07,128
hiring is,is the main cause why I
I am where I am right now.Yeah.

527
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:16,219
So I,it's may not be the,the case
for,for everyone,uh,but just put

528
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:19,219
yourself out there,you know,if
you have any projects,even if

529
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:23,989
they are small or if they are
like,Really not that interesting.

530
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:28,159
I don't wanna say that they're
not interesting,but just put your

531
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,929
projects out there,put them on
Twitter,GitHub everywhere.And,

532
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:36,648
uh,yeah,that's it.So anyway,
sorry.I,

533
00:38:38,298 --> 00:38:38,688
Bekah: Don't be

534
00:38:38,688 --> 00:38:43,309
Reda: uh,yeah.Uh,so after the
anti interview,I,they actually

535
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:47,268
like,uh,just sends me the,the
offer.Yeah.

536
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:47,898
Bekah: Wow.

537
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:52,864
Reda: Yeah,it was pretty,so they,
it was kinda like the,the moment

538
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:55,443
they contact me,they already made
their mind that they're gonna

539
00:38:55,443 --> 00:39:01,474
hire me.So it was just about,uh,
if I say yes or no,so yeah.

540
00:39:02,378 --> 00:39:05,378
Bekah: That's awesome.Uh,is it a
company in your country?

541
00:39:06,393 --> 00:39:09,664
Reda: Yeah,it's in my country,
but it's remote.It's100%remote.

542
00:39:09,963 --> 00:39:13,744
So yeah,it was actually too good
to be true,so,

543
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:19,313
Bekah: I almost like,like the
idea of a surprise interview,cuz

544
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:21,534
then you're not really nervous if
you just think that you're going

545
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:23,813
in to talk to them and then
they're like,oh,surprise

546
00:39:23,813 --> 00:39:26,333
interview.And you're like,well,I
didn't have the last three days.

547
00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:31,804
Reda: Yeah,yeah.But,but it,it
wasn't any hard,you know,it was

548
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:35,373
more of a discussion than an
interview,you know,but it,it,it

549
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:39,873
was like the first and final.So
it's,it was pretty much good

550
00:39:39,903 --> 00:39:43,534
because I had previously,I had
some pretty much bad experience

551
00:39:43,534 --> 00:39:47,298
with going through.Three
interviews and in the end getting

552
00:39:47,389 --> 00:39:50,809
like rejected.So yeah.

553
00:39:52,074 --> 00:39:55,284
Bekah: Do you,did you find,like
living in Morocco,that the job

554
00:39:55,284 --> 00:39:58,673
search was even more challenging?
Uh,if you were looking for remote

555
00:39:58,793 --> 00:39:59,213
work?

556
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:05,719
Reda: Uh,it was more challenging
for me because,uh,I didn't have,

557
00:40:06,168 --> 00:40:09,768
I didn't have a degree,you know,
I didn't have a degree in

558
00:40:09,768 --> 00:40:12,648
computer science.I have a degree
in my mechanics,but not in

559
00:40:12,648 --> 00:40:17,148
computer science.And in Morocco,
it's,uh,it's kinda,I,I wasn't

560
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:22,068
even applying for jobs in Morocco
because I thought it's,it's,uh,

561
00:40:22,278 --> 00:40:26,014
impossible for me to get a job
here.As most of companies,they

562
00:40:26,014 --> 00:40:30,393
are like asking for a degree,you
know?And uh,the funny thing is,

563
00:40:31,384 --> 00:40:34,833
during my interview with,uh,my
current company,the first thing I

564
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:39,094
said is,I don't have a degree
just for information.I don't have

565
00:40:39,094 --> 00:40:43,443
a degree in computer science.Uh,
but practically they said like,

566
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:48,603
um,what matter is talent and not
like a piece of paper.And that

567
00:40:48,603 --> 00:40:56,208
was like,uh,e even if I didn't,
Like get in the the company.That

568
00:40:56,228 --> 00:40:57,849
was a boost for me.Yeah.

569
00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:00,414
Bekah: That's awesome.

570
00:41:00,844 --> 00:41:03,244
Dan: It's good to hear.I mean,
that,that,that aligns,I think

571
00:41:03,514 --> 00:41:08,164
with a lot of the people that I
end up,you know,enjoying working

572
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:12,903
for.Right.Uh,the,the degrees are,
um,I don't know,it's,it almost

573
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,364
seems silly sometimes.I mean,not
that getting a degree is silly,

574
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:19,554
but like the idea that,uh,in our
field,A degree after four years,

575
00:41:19,554 --> 00:41:23,213
I feel like is going to be so out
of date to be almost,I not

576
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:25,434
useless.Obviously,you like in
college,I think the important

577
00:41:25,434 --> 00:41:28,554
thing is to like,learn how to
learn,right?That's,that's more,

578
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:32,753
you know,but at the same time,
uh,somebody with a,a certain

579
00:41:32,753 --> 00:41:35,063
amount of experience is going to
have the same,if not a better,

580
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:37,824
you know,uh,handle on all that
stuff than

581
00:41:38,514 --> 00:41:39,324
Reda: Yeah.Yeah,

582
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,193
Dan: went to college,you know?

583
00:41:40,744 --> 00:41:45,273
Reda: that's,uh,that's a good
point because,uh,that current

584
00:41:45,278 --> 00:41:49,969
company,like,they told me that
they interview like,uh,People

585
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:55,369
with degrees and like engineers,
you know,like before me.But the,

586
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:59,898
the only difference is I had
projects I had,like I know how to

587
00:41:59,898 --> 00:42:02,869
search for information and how I
know how to learn by myself.

588
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:09,018
Yeah.And like one of the plus for
me is that,say it was a self

589
00:42:09,018 --> 00:42:14,628
thought developer,so they know
like they they won't need,uh,it,

590
00:42:14,628 --> 00:42:17,778
it's just a sign that you can
learn by,by yourself,you know?

591
00:42:20,244 --> 00:42:22,793
Dan: Yeah,a hundred percent.Uh,
with that,I mean,that,that's

592
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:25,614
always,that's always gonna be a,
a point in your favor in my book.

593
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:31,253
Um,just,I mean,as a self-taught
