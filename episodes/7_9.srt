9
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:47,326
Dan: Hey,what up Beck?How's it

10
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:51,406
Bekah: going?Yo,it is going good.
We just wrapped up our lightning

11
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,186
talks.They were

12
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:56,057
Dan: amazing.Amazing.My gosh.
Yeah.So many good talks.

13
00:00:56,536 --> 00:00:59,087
Bekah: We had11or12,which was
really

14
00:00:59,087 --> 00:00:59,447
Nick: fun.

15
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:06,736
Dan: Yeah,I know.I can't count,
but like there was so many and,

16
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:12,406
uh,yeah,I did,I did a talk and,
um,somebody made me not touch my

17
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,897
talk until last night at like
nine o'clock.

18
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:16,147
Bekah: Oh,someone made you do
that?

19
00:01:16,147 --> 00:01:19,456
Dan: Yeah,yeah,yeah.It was not my
fault at all.Uh,so I did the

20
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:23,356
thing where,you know,you know how
you commit to something wait way

21
00:01:23,356 --> 00:01:25,037
ahead of time to make yourself do
it.

22
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:28,277
Bekah: Yeah.And then like someone
reminds you constantly.Right,

23
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:30,028
right,right.And then you have
somebody that you,and then you

24
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:31,546
still don't do it.Like,kind of
like

25
00:01:31,546 --> 00:01:35,671
Dan: that,that reminds you a
bunch of times to work on.and you

26
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:39,001
ignore them over and over again.
Uhhuh.Yeah.Yeah.And then at the

27
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:43,022
end of the day,like the night
before,it's late and you have to

28
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:47,731
do your slides and all that
stuff.And it's not your fault at

29
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:48,481
all.Right?

30
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:55,591
Bekah: wrong.very wrong.Anyway,I
I was up late too.I don't know

31
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:58,561
what that feels like,Dan.I don't,
that's not me.I'm not

32
00:01:58,561 --> 00:01:59,402
Nick: that person.

33
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,941
Dan: Yeah.Well,I,I,I've just kind
of always been that person.

34
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:06,031
Although last,this,this was like
an extreme example and I'm not

35
00:02:06,037 --> 00:02:09,931
really sure why,you know,it just
happened,uh,where I was like,

36
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:12,331
every day I was like,I should
work on my lightning talk.I

37
00:02:12,336 --> 00:02:15,331
should work on my laptop.One of
the problems was I couldn't cite

38
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:19,771
on a topic.I was waffling between
two topics for a really long

39
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:26,461
time.And,uh,you know,so I finally
decided on a topic on I think

40
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:29,282
Wednesday.When did I send you the
ti?I sent you a title just to

41
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:33,257
like,I sent you a title,I think.
Uh,On Wednesday or Thursday just

42
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:37,067
to like commit myself I still
honestly had thought there was a

43
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:40,817
point last night at like7:00PM I
think where I was like,I should

44
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:41,687
tell Beck I'm doing the other
one.

45
00:02:44,507 --> 00:02:48,856
Bekah: I will say,I will say
that.It was very good,so.Well

46
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:53,086
thank you.Yeah,it was fun.It
turned out to be insightful and

47
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:56,477
something that I haven't really
heard anybody else talk about.So

48
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:59,667
I did very much appreciate Good

49
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:00,106
Nick: your

50
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:04,847
Dan: av.That's good.Cause my
other one was like a css,you

51
00:03:04,847 --> 00:03:07,817
know,thing,you know what I mean?
And it would've been fun and

52
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:11,266
stuff,but like,it was like more
of like a tech talk,you know?And

53
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:15,467
this was the first one,uh,that
I've ever really done.I've really

54
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:18,787
done.That wasn't just about like
some technology,you know?So I

55
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:21,706
dunno.It was fun.I liked it.I
liked a lot.Interesting.You wanna

56
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:24,106
catch up later,you know,check us
out.Virtual coffee?No.

57
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:27,227
youtube.com/virtual coffee io.Is
that right?

58
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:32,026
Bekah: Me too.Yeah.And YouTube
changed things a little bit.So

59
00:03:32,116 --> 00:03:36,377
sometimes there's some issues if
you do slash virtual coffee io,

60
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:40,366
cuz now they have handles.So it
might be slash at virtual coffee

61
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:43,456
io.But either way you should be
able to find your way there

62
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:46,576
Dan: either way.Or go to virtual
coffee.io and

63
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:47,537
Nick: there's links to YouTube.

64
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:51,706

00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:17,521
No developer experience lead at a

87
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:18,901
that you can find out more

88
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:23,041
Nick: about later.you've never
heard of tb D uh,Dan,it's,it's a

89
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,322
pretty,pretty popular company.A
lot of people are

90
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,752
Dan: TB io.Yeah.Yeah.Oh,man.

91
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:34,442
Bekah: All right.And I answered
this question yesterday,so I

92
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:37,322
wondered be a vet and then my mom
was like,do you know that you

93
00:05:37,322 --> 00:05:40,771
have to put a thermometer up Dogs
butts to take their temperature?

94
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,982
And I was like,I don't wanna do
that.How about I be a forensic,

95
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:46,322
forensic pathologist instead?

96
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:50,012
Dan: I feel like dogs,dogs Butts
is like the best case scenario in

97
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:50,911
that situation too,

98
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:56,132
Bekah: we were like very,very
big,um,X-Files fans,so,okay.I

99
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:58,201
just wanted to be a Scully,
really.That's all I.

100
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:02,692
Nick: And okay.That,that,that's,
that's valid.Uh,yeah.I'd probably

101
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:05,552
take a,yeah,I'd probably take a
Scully over,uh,hold on a sec.Let

102
00:06:05,552 --> 00:06:09,391
me stick this thermometer in your
dog's butt.You know,just in terms

103
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:12,692
of,uh,you know,at least,you know,
when you're doing small talk at a

104
00:06:12,692 --> 00:06:16,201
party,I don't mean to,I don't
mean to brag,but I,I stick a

105
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:19,982
thermometer up Dog's butts daily,
you know,um,can I buy you a

106
00:06:19,982 --> 00:06:28,291
drink,I dunno if that's violating
any of our code of conduct.I'll

107
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,762
find,I'll find out after we're

108
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:34,471
Bekah: not yet there,so we're
good.Alright,Dan,

109
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:34,951
Nick: you're

110
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:35,252
turn.

111
00:06:35,257 --> 00:06:41,252
Dan: Uh oh.Wow.Yeah.Okay.Hi,I'm
Dan.I,um,live in Cleveland.I am a

112
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:46,862
web site developer.I don't know.
That seems so weird.

113
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:48,391
Nick: I'm never know your title
web

114
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:50,882
Dan: developer.I don't know.I
don't have a title is the

115
00:06:50,882 --> 00:06:51,391
problem,

116
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:55,391
Nick: you know.You get to make up
your own title.Businessman Dan,t

117
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:56,271
b Dan TB

118
00:06:57,182 --> 00:07:01,141
Dan: That that's right.And,uh,
yes,going along with the T B D

119
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:08,192
theme.I,I mean,I,I never had a
job that I wanted to do as a kid.

120
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:10,622
I don't,I mean,like,I'm sure
there's jobs that like,sounded as

121
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,591
exciting or whatever,but there
was never,like,I never latched on

122
00:07:13,591 --> 00:07:16,502
anything.The only thing,I was
talking about this on Thursday,

123
00:07:16,507 --> 00:07:19,862
the only thing that I can really
remember related to that was that

124
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:24,661
I knew for sure that I did not
want to be a lawyer cuz my dad's

125
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:25,081
lawyer.

126
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:26,221
Nick: All I

127
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:29,552
Bekah: wanted to be from the time
I was11until the time I was21.

128
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:31,411
That's what I wanted to be a
lawyer.

129
00:07:32,062 --> 00:07:34,591
Dan: Yeah.Yeah.Well that's
different than a forensic second.

130
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:35,521
Well,now you're changing

131
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,221
Bekah: your story.Okay.Because
what?Well,but it was like the

132
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:42,512
first job that you wanted.But
from the time I was11until21,

133
00:07:42,781 --> 00:07:45,242
that's all I wanted to be.And
then I didn't do great on my

134
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:47,632
LSATs.Okay.I didn't hit that161

135
00:07:49,072 --> 00:07:52,591
Nick: tldr.No dog thermometer
butts,no dog thermometer,butts.

136
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:55,072
That's the continuing theme,
basically.Mm-hmm.Yeah.Yeah.

137
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:57,541
Dan: Although I,you know,hearing
the stories my dad tells,uh,

138
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,091
honestly,like if he had to choose
between sitting through another

139
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:02,942
like board meeting with the
people,you know,they get to deal

140
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:06,466
with or.Doing the dog,but thing,
I think he probably will choose

141
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:11,836
the dog butt thing.honestly,in
retrospect.Um,but yeah,I mean,he

142
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:17,086
is like,he does like property law
stuff,you know,and it's,it always

143
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:21,576
seemed very,very,very,very boring
to me.And so,although he's,he's

144
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:26,536
a,you know,successful,you know,
self-driven career as well as

145
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:30,257
that stuff,so no shots,uh,
against lawyers.It's just like

146
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:34,006
never seemed good to me.And so I
don't really have an answer.That

147
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:35,626
was my non-answer.And,uh,

148
00:08:35,836 --> 00:08:39,917
Nick: yeah,that's it.Okay.I,I
don't have a really good answer

149
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:45,807
either,but,and,and I'm gonna give
a long story,sorry.But,uh,so I,I

150
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:49,157
didn't really know what I wanted
to do.And like,I don't know if

151
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:52,307
you grew up with people that are,
like,they knew what they wanted

152
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:55,336
to do from like,day one.Like,I
remember in high school,like

153
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:58,966
grade seven,somebody's like,
yeah,I'm gonna be a doctor.And

154
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,687
they became a,I think they did
become a doctor,but like,I'm

155
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:09,751
like,No idea.You know,like I had
Doritos like an hour ago.That's

156
00:09:09,812 --> 00:09:18,392
was exciting.Um,But,uh,I,I don't
know,like,as,like,I had,this is

157
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:22,231
like less of a job these days for
like kids,but like,I used to have

158
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:28,562
a paper route and I was okay.But
like,I remember as a kid,like my

159
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:33,902
dream job was to be a gas pump
station attendant,partially

160
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:36,721
because I do like the smell of
gas.You know,there's,there's

161
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:39,871
people that either like the smell
of gas or they don't.I am on

162
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:45,572
team,smells good.And I don't
know.There was,I agree.Yeah,

163
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:48,451
yeah,yeah.But I don't know why,
but it just seemed like a cool

164
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:52,922
job and it's what I wanted to do.
And in retrospect,I,I,well,one,I

165
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:56,672
didn't end up doing that.Uh,so
probably smelling those fumes all

166
00:09:56,672 --> 00:10:01,618
day is probably a good thing.I
didn't do that,but,um,in high

167
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:05,027
school,the,I don't know if they
still do this,but they used to

168
00:10:05,027 --> 00:10:08,777
give out,like surveys you would
fill out,like what's your career

169
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:15,106
gonna be by some criteria you
fill out.And my,my career was

170
00:10:15,106 --> 00:10:20,116
supposed to be a cheese maker,so
I was like,I'm like,I'm cool with

171
00:10:20,177 --> 00:10:25,636
that.I like cheese.But,uh,I
honestly,I never really had

172
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:29,567
anything like big dreams of
things aside from I love

173
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,897
basketball.I,I've,I've told this
many times to people in virtual

174
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:37,756
coffee,but,uh,for folks who can't
see us,cuz it's a podcast,I'm

175
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:43,366
five seven,but I used to be
obsessed with basketball and I

176
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:47,386
used to literally be able to grab
a regulation rim.Like I couldn't

177
00:10:47,386 --> 00:10:49,966
dunk it cuz I couldn't palm a
ball,but I could literally jump

178
00:10:49,971 --> 00:10:54,496
high enough to grab the rim that
is and.Crazy impressive.Yeah,it

179
00:10:54,496 --> 00:11:00,647
is.It,it,it,it was impressive.At
the time I was135pounds.Now I'm

180
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:05,177
like,I'm a little bulkier,so
like,I'm like195right now,but,

181
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:10,442
But the thing was,I was so
obsessed with basketball,like,

182
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:13,201
you know,like a lot of people,I
was,it was in the nineties,so

183
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:17,491
loved Michael Jordan,the bowls
and stuff,and I was constantly

184
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:20,282
jumping like all the time,like
I'm not exaggerating.Like I

185
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:23,131
bought these books from the back
of a body building magazine on

186
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:26,611
how to improve your vertical.
This is like I'm,I don't know if

187
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:29,402
they still sell stuff in the back
of books like that,like buy this

188
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:30,511
pamphlet or whatever.

189
00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:33,211
Bekah: Like listen,we just bought
some kind of bands to improve our

190
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:37,331
vertical in this house.Okay.So
like we would be those people

191
00:11:37,841 --> 00:11:40,351
Nick: Yeah.But the thing is it
worked.It's just you have to

192
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:43,532
consistently do it.And I was
literally in my parents'living

193
00:11:43,532 --> 00:11:48,032
room using a dining room chair
doing one legged jumps and then

194
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:50,642
like eventually I was able to
touch our ceiling.It was like a

195
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:54,981
split level house,but basically,
Pretty high.I used to have these

196
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:59,721
things called moon boots,uh,and
they're basically running shoes

197
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:02,841
where your platform is in the
front and your heel is never

198
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:07,522
touching the ground.Uh,I did all
those things and like in,in,this

199
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:11,511
is such a long answer,sorry.But
like in between all that,I broke

200
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:15,471
my ankle playing basketball.So I
was like in a cast,uh,before

201
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:18,381
grade nine,all the way up to my
knee for like the whole summer.

202
00:12:18,861 --> 00:12:23,091
Oh.So part,part of getting back
to,into things like it took me a

203
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:26,032
year to be able to run again.So
like physio,all that stuff,and

204
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:31,221
that's one of the moon boots and
the jumping.And anyways,uh,that

205
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:35,991
didn't pan out because one,I'm
five seven and I'm also realized

206
00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:39,892
I am clearly not good enough to
play in the N V A,which is pretty

207
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:44,101
much probably most people,but.
Yeah,that was,that was kind of

208
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:46,591
it.That's my long-winded story.
Maybe I should have been a cheese

209
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:47,461
maker.Who knows.

210
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:52,142
Bekah: I think you're doing a
pretty great job at what you are

211
00:12:52,142 --> 00:12:57,631
doing,so I don't think you should
be a cheese maker.Um,but the last

212
00:12:57,631 --> 00:13:00,721
time we had you on,you had a
totally different job.You wanna

213
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:02,341
tell people about what you're
doing now?

214
00:13:03,302 --> 00:13:05,822
Nick: Yeah,yeah.So,yeah.So the
first,like you were saying,the

215
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:10,741
first episode of this podcast,I
was working at dev dot two.Uh,so

216
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:14,147
I've been working in opensource
professionally since January,

217
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:17,402
2020.I was contributing to
opensource prior to that,and I,I

218
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:21,871
still do contribute to opensource
outside of work hours,but,um,now

219
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:26,131
I'm at Netlify,uh,I'm on the
ecosystem pillar,which is just a

220
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:30,961
fancy name for like the big team.
And then I'm on a,a smaller team

221
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:34,442
within there called the
Frameworks team.So,uh,basically

222
00:13:34,442 --> 00:13:39,346
my job is to make sure.Whatever
framework you're deploying to

223
00:13:39,346 --> 00:13:43,726
Netlify.It works.Uh,it's not just
my team.Like,there's obviously

224
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:47,986
people that run the platform and
stuff,but like,I'm kind of,my

225
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:51,647
team is at the center of like,
the actual build of the framework

226
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:55,667
and making sure it works properly
with like serverless and edge.So

227
00:13:55,996 --> 00:13:58,636
that's,that's kind of what I've
been up to.I've been there.It's

228
00:13:58,996 --> 00:14:02,777
actually gonna be my one year
anniversary on Tuesday,so,Hey.

229
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:07,846
Nice.It's,it's pretty wild.Like,
I feel like I've been there

230
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:11,687
forever,but I mean that in a good
way.You know,like how it,it's

231
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:13,667
kind of like if you're just
hanging out with people for like

232
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:15,947
a weekend or something and you
feel like,or like a great

233
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:19,187
vacation and you're like,it's
like five days,but you feel like

234
00:14:19,187 --> 00:14:21,346
you've been there two weeks,you
know,kind of.So it's,it's felt

235
00:14:21,346 --> 00:14:26,341
like that,and I have really
great.Managers and skip level.

236
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:29,581
They're,they're super supportive
and everybody's really cool.So

237
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:34,022
it's,you know,last time I was on
the podcast I said Dev two was my

238
00:14:34,022 --> 00:14:38,072
dream job,and it was at the time.
And like,so right now this is my

239
00:14:38,432 --> 00:14:42,542
dream job.So like,not that I plan
on leaving any type suit,but

240
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:46,201
like,hopefully I can keep saying
my dream job is my next job all

241
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:48,922
the time.So,uh,yeah.I love

242
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:52,471
Dan: that.I love that.We love
Nefi Edwards coffee.We would,

243
00:14:52,562 --> 00:14:55,682
we've been nullify.I,I,I
wouldn't,I don't wanna say

244
00:14:56,042 --> 00:15:00,902
customers because they nullify
has a,an amazing open source

245
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:04,351
like,I don't know,plan or
whatever you wanna call it.Um,

246
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:06,902
yeah,so if you're,you're open
source repositories,they'll host

247
00:15:06,902 --> 00:15:09,692
your sites for free and give you,
like the pro plan,give you what

248
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:13,951
Nefi,uh,uh,is the pro plan.If
you're a business and you have

249
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:17,432
private repositories,um,if you're
an open source organization,

250
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:21,361
they'll give you the pro plan for
free.And,um,we've been on Nefi

251
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:26,206
since,I don't know,whenever the,
whenever like we.redid the web

252
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:26,506
like

253
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:29,537
Bekah: it was the first year for
Octoberfest Octoberfest.Yeah.So

254
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:30,076
that's probably April

255
00:15:30,437 --> 00:15:33,226
Nick: 20,October of2020.Um,and
yeah,we've been,

256
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,106
Dan: we've on that since then.
And I,I've been,I I've always

257
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:38,596
been a huge fan,so I,when we,
when I heard you were going

258
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:41,206
there,I was,I was very,very
excited.It was,it was

259
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:45,586
Nick: awesome.Okay.I just,sorry,
I'm just laughing cuz Triple B's

260
00:15:45,586 --> 00:15:49,397
in the chat,uh,bald bearded
builder or Michael O Jolly and I

261
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:54,346
said,Hey,triple B,but I wrote
triple B and so now I triple,

262
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:57,226
triple,triple.Yeah.Or maybe we
could call him triple trouble.I

263
00:15:57,226 --> 00:16:05,777
don't know.but yeah,no,it's,it's
great.Yeah,no like,uh,Netlify is

264
00:16:05,777 --> 00:16:09,076
a big fan of open source,so like
that's why they offer those plans

265
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:13,037
like that.It's uh,uh,you know,
it's,they don't just give'em out

266
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:17,251
to anybody.But definitely there's
lots of,lots of great.Open source

267
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:19,081
projects that,uh,we like to
support.

268
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:22,052
Dan: So,yeah.And we didn't like,
it wasn't,I,I think they give it

269
00:16:22,052 --> 00:16:25,621
out to mostly anybody if you're
actually an open source

270
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:29,971
organization.You know,they,like,
we didn't,I mean,I applied and I

271
00:16:29,971 --> 00:16:34,741
got,it was like a form,you know,
and got a response.Yeah.The same

272
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:36,692
day or the next day or something
like that.You know,it wasn't

273
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:40,501
like,it was very easy and it was,
it was totally cool.So.Awesome.

274
00:16:41,131 --> 00:16:44,596
Speaking of frameworks,Onfi,are
you gonna be.Getting some

275
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:46,187
WordPress going on there pretty
soon.

276
00:16:46,697 --> 00:16:50,897
Nick: Hp Yeah.Yeah,yeah,yeah.
Well,you can actually,I,I know,I

277
00:16:50,897 --> 00:16:54,527
know you're,you're,you're joking,
kind of being slash serious,but

278
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:59,687
you can actually,my,my coworker
Matt Cain,who,uh,currently isn't

279
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:03,376
on the frameworks team,but he
was,but uh,you can actually run,

280
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:07,787
he has an example of running PHP
and Wam on the edge.Uh,I can find

281
00:17:07,787 --> 00:17:11,836
that tweet.So like,if you wanna
deploy your,uh,your Word press

282
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:16,576
site within Wam,within an edge
function,Dan,there you go.

283
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:19,846
Dan: So,yeah,that,I think that
fits right into the,like,

284
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:23,356
squarely into the,you know,you
were so interested in seeing if

285
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:25,636
you could,you didn't stop to
think if you should

286
00:17:26,957 --> 00:17:30,227
Nick: Oh,yeah,yeah.No,it was
definitely,definitely a,a proof

287
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:33,646
of concept,a fun thing.It was
more.I,I remember when he put it

288
00:17:33,646 --> 00:17:38,836
out.I,I,I think I responded with,
now even JavaScript devs can get

289
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:41,477
their Lamborghini cuz like
everybody always has those jokes

290
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,416
about Oh yeah.Well they're not
necessarily jokes like the,the

291
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:48,136
creator of Lave has a
Lamborghini,I believe.Uh,cuz like

292
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:52,967
p h P and Laravel are,are pretty
successful even though people try

293
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:55,067
to trash talk it all the time.So
it's,uh,no

294
00:17:55,227 --> 00:17:58,336
Dan: pH php tells Awesome.I I
honestly actually work in PHP all

295
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:02,807
the time.But,uh,you know,I,I was
just trying to think of a,a jokey

296
00:18:02,807 --> 00:18:05,567
framework and WordPress is the
first thing that I thought of,

297
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:08,057
so,you know.All right.Um,

298
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:10,981
Nick: that's awesome.What,Yeah.

299
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:16,592
Bekah: Michael also said,next
step,they put all that in flash

300
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:19,442
and we,there was like actually
flash stuff covered in our

301
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:23,281
lightning talks earlier today,
so,okay.It's that me,it's not

302
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:24,211
gone forever.

303
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:28,142
Nick: Yeah.I'll,I'll get,I'll get
working on that cold fusion and,

304
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:32,221
uh,while I'm at it,Michael,I'll
also work on getting Java apples

305
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:34,892
in waza working on the edge if
you want.So,uh,

306
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:40,632
Dan: Man,Java apples.I just got
like a shiver,like a cold shiver

307
00:18:40,632 --> 00:18:40,633
of,

308
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:46,622
Nick: yeah,it was,I,I still
remember it.Uh,just like you'd

309
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:49,832
have your website and then there
would be this gray square with

310
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:54,362
this little Java logo coffee with
the,with the hot part of the

311
00:18:54,362 --> 00:18:58,682
coffee kind of waving and it'd
just be like loading apple or

312
00:18:58,682 --> 00:19:01,652
something.And it,and they took
forever cuz like,broadband

313
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:07,592
internet only really came about
like mid to late nineties.So

314
00:19:07,592 --> 00:19:12,422
like,I don't know,I,I almost kind
of wonder if like,uh,it would,

315
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:17,926
uh,if it would've caught on
better,um,if,if broadband had

316
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:21,662
been more prevalent at the time,
cuz like it was slow,you know,

317
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:24,346
just cuz of that.But,uh,yeah,

318
00:19:24,557 --> 00:19:27,017
Dan: I mean,you know,not to get
too far into it.I,I think the,

319
00:19:27,017 --> 00:19:29,896
the real,the big reason like Java
stuff got shut down and also

320
00:19:29,896 --> 00:19:33,517
flash was security,you know,
problems.Yeah.Rampant security

321
00:19:33,521 --> 00:19:39,707
problems.Um,but the,Nope,I had
something else to say,but I,I

322
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:41,896
lost it so we can,we can move on.

323
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:49,037
Bekah: Sorry.I was just like,I'm
being super distracted by Michael

324
00:19:49,037 --> 00:19:53,656
in the chat who says,I still
didn't know why I just didn't

325
00:19:53,656 --> 00:19:58,126
remain a V B A developer by now.
I'd be integrating chat g p T

326
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:03,196
into Excel and Word like a boss
Michael.The time has not run out.

327
00:20:03,196 --> 00:20:04,366
You can still do all of

328
00:20:04,557 --> 00:20:04,757
Nick: those.

329
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:11,672

00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:23,521
was on the podcast this season.
So we can go ahead and dive into

350
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:27,031
some of those questions.Unless
Nick,there's something that you

351
00:21:27,362 --> 00:21:30,632
want to bring up and to talk
about as our special.

352
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,862
Nick: Um,I can't at the moment.
I'll,I'll try and think of

353
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:38,132
something else.Uh,I,I got
slightly distracted cuz I have to

354
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:41,761
just reply to an email for
something,but,uh,I'll definitely,

355
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:44,582
I'll definitely try and think of
something cuz I,I know I'm super

356
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:47,372
happy to be on the podcast.It's
just like there's something that

357
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:50,071
had come up that I completely
forgot about,so I just had to

358
00:21:50,071 --> 00:21:53,041
email them.But,uh,let me just
send that.

359
00:21:53,071 --> 00:21:55,832
Bekah: Michael,you are on
Twitter,so in the chat I'm

360
00:21:55,832 --> 00:21:59,971
responding to the chat.Michael,
if you're not on Twitter,I dm you

361
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:06,701
on Twitter.Um,we do not do our
chat on ma does he reply?No.yes,

362
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:11,701
he does reply we don't do
Mastodon chats because we're,

363
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:15,916
we're not.We're not down with
Mastodon yet,right?

364
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:18,826
Nick: I,I mean,I,I've been on
don't for a while,but I don't

365
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:20,656
even know where to start with
Mastodon.Nick.

366
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:23,957
Bekah: Nick is down with
Mastodon.You can DM him on

367
00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:25,446
Mastodon.Free

368
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:28,636
Nick: to let free,feel free to
toot me.Toot me Toot away.Toot.

369
00:22:28,787 --> 00:22:32,237
Bekah: Why is it called that?
Okay,that's not going to any

370
00:22:32,237 --> 00:22:32,926
place that

371
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:37,037
Nick: caused you,okay,so,so I can
explain all this if it's not

372
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:41,747
clear,but like,also I'm the,the
MAs on instance.So like,unlike

373
00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:46,156
Twitter,Twitter,it's like there's
just twitter.com mast on,you have

374
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:49,547
several instance,not several,
like as many instances as people

375
00:22:49,547 --> 00:22:53,507
wanna create.And then,so like,
I'm on a instance,I joined in

376
00:22:53,507 --> 00:23:00,271
2017.and it's called Tut Cafe.So
like,if you wanna reach me on ma

377
00:23:00,451 --> 00:23:07,051
on my address is Nikki Nikki t
Online Tut Cafe.Um,the reason I'm

378
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:11,791
pretty sure why it's called Toot
is because the logo is a ma on

379
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:17,761
like the,which is I think,pretty
similar to a mammoth,like a wooly

380
00:23:17,761 --> 00:23:21,662
mammoth.I'm not sure what the
diff difference is,but like,it's

381
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:25,592
so like elephant trunk and I
guess elephant trunks make a

382
00:23:25,592 --> 00:23:29,011
tooting noise.Either that or
mastodons farted a lot back in

383
00:23:29,011 --> 00:23:32,821
the ice age.I have no idea but
they,they just went with that.So

384
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:38,852
Dan: yeah,there's almost no doubt
that that's it,you know?All

385
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:43,801
right.I feel like,uh,Google says
MAs duns were shorter and

386
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:47,461
stockier than mammoths with
shorter and straighter tus.

387
00:23:48,071 --> 00:23:49,412
Nick: So,okay.Okay.There you go.

388
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:52,652
Bekah: Gotcha.Okay.And what
everybody really wants to know is

389
00:23:52,652 --> 00:23:58,231
that they are using DNA of
mastodons,right.With elephants to

390
00:23:58,231 --> 00:23:59,761
breed them into existence.

391
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,862
Dan: I thought you talk about the
meatball.

392
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:09,392
Nick: Oh,meatballs.Did you say
Mastodon?Meatballs.Meatball.I

393
00:24:09,392 --> 00:24:11,731
think I'm gonna have to do a hard
pass on prehistoric meat.

394
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:16,682
Somebody made a meatball from,
that's before.Uh,one A meatball.

395
00:24:16,686 --> 00:24:17,221
No,no.This,

396
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:22,112
Dan: yes.No,this is like truly,
uh,truly.I don't know.What,what

397
00:24:22,231 --> 00:24:28,922
do you call it?Like,just awful
stuff.But somebody made,um,do I

398
00:24:28,922 --> 00:24:32,071
have to share my whole screen?Oh
yeah.Window.Alright,here we go.

399
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:38,251
Ready?Here it is.All right.
Window share.Did that work?Yeah.

400
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:43,201
Somebody get outta here ad
somebody.Made a massive meatball

401
00:24:43,321 --> 00:24:46,981
with mo moly,mammoth dna.And,uh,
I've seen this Atlanta a bunch of

402
00:24:46,981 --> 00:24:50,432
times.I've refused to open the
articles but still it stuck into

403
00:24:50,436 --> 00:24:53,821
my brain.I don't,I I haven't
actually read the article.So,um,

404
00:24:54,602 --> 00:24:55,142
Nick: meatballs,

405
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:58,051
Dan: I'll,I'll put this,I'll put
this in the,uh,and

406
00:24:59,251 --> 00:25:02,791
Nick: may maybe that could,could
drive adoption of people using

407
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:07,112
Mastodon,like create an,create an
account and get like a,get like a

408
00:25:07,112 --> 00:25:09,571
free bag of meatballs.Kind of
like,you know,like,I don't know

409
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:12,241
if,if,if your families eat the
IKEA meatballs,they're,they're

410
00:25:12,241 --> 00:25:16,352
pretty solid.Those,those50.Yeah.
Yeah,yeah.And it's,it,it's just

411
00:25:16,352 --> 00:25:20,041
they come with an Allen key too.
Almost bet.Almost.Right?Right.

412
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:21,561
Yeah.Sorry,

413
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:27,662
Dan: I got,I saw,um,Very good
prank.You know,sometimes pranks

414
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:29,642
are like mean spirited,and
sometimes pranks are really,

415
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:32,672
really good.And I saw a prank and
I think they actually got in real

416
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,122
trouble for it.But,uh,somebody,
you know how,um,Ikea has those

417
00:25:36,182 --> 00:25:39,842
arrows to sh to like point you
through the way they like put in

418
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:47,372
fake arrows and made like a maze
that never ends in Ikea,which,

419
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:49,531
uh,was very entertaining to me.
So if you follow the arrows,you

420
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:53,461
just kind of keep going in
circles,you know?Uh,anyway,

421
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:54,362
that's my,my case story.

422
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:58,832
Bekah: So I feel like the,the
biggest issue here is that we let

423
00:25:58,836 --> 00:26:05,102
Michael derail any conversation
that we had,which I,I should have

424
00:26:05,102 --> 00:26:07,801
known better because I have
worked for him for an entire

425
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:13,846
year.This is what happens when
you.Michael comment on anything,

426
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,856
Nick: I'm,I'm,I'm,I'm embracing
the Triple B derailment of the

427
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:19,758
conversation.The,the

428
00:26:19,762 --> 00:26:22,876
Bekah: Triple B derailment.We
have had some marathon meetings,

429
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:32,027
um,which were we're,we're very,
very great.Um,but that also

430
00:26:32,537 --> 00:26:37,757
brings us to a topic about
perseverance,which,uh,we post

431
00:26:37,757 --> 00:26:41,386
about in our Twitter chat.Have
you ever felt like giving up but

432
00:26:41,386 --> 00:26:45,856
ended up not,what motivated you
to keep going and what did you

433
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:49,457
learn from that experience?Are
there challenges that you have

434
00:26:49,457 --> 00:26:52,007
ahead,that you're afraid you
won't be able to complete?And how

435
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:58,186
can we help?That was our,that was
our back pocket topic on Tuesday.

436
00:26:59,737 --> 00:27:02,926
Nick: Yeah.I missed,I missed
Tuesday as there Thursday,but,

437
00:27:02,926 --> 00:27:10,412
uh,no,it's a,it's a great
question.It's,it's like,I,I don't

438
00:27:10,412 --> 00:27:18,932
know.I mean,like,in terms of like
giving up,it's like I,like I've

439
00:27:18,932 --> 00:27:21,872
mentioned this to you before,
Bekah,I,uh,yeah.Triple B's

440
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:27,092
derailing it's a manager
developed a lot of perseverance.

441
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:30,332
I,me,sorry,sorry,sorry.Folks who
are listening to this,you can't

442
00:27:30,332 --> 00:27:35,551
see the chat,but,uh,triple B is
making us laugh.Um,no,I,I think,

443
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:39,451
you know,maybe,maybe the first
time where you,you think you

444
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:43,291
can't do something,it's,it's
pretty daunting.And then,you

445
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:46,771
know,like,you know,maybe you got
support or you did it on your

446
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:51,531
own,but you get past that hump of
like,okay,I did it.You know?And.

447
00:27:52,557 --> 00:27:57,287
the more that happens,uh,I think
it's,it's easier to say,like when

448
00:27:57,287 --> 00:28:00,916
you're,you're like,uh,I don't
know if I can keep doing this.

449
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:04,457
And then,you know,I'll,I'll think
back,like,uh,even if it's not the

450
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:07,817
same thing,I'm like,no,I got past
this.You know,and like,so,and

451
00:28:07,817 --> 00:28:11,207
like,I,I don't know.It's
something that's over the years

452
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:16,817
also,like,just,just having,like,
you know,definitely had some

453
00:28:16,817 --> 00:28:20,717
rough stuff happen to me in,in
my,my personal life that I don't,

454
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:23,686
I don't really particularly wanna
talk on stream about,but like,

455
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:27,707
there's just so many things that
I don't care about because of

456
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:31,307
that,like,that are just so,like,
it,it's,it's something I don't

457
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:34,217
worry about.You know what I mean?
And so like,when it comes to

458
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:40,906
tasks and stuff,I think it,it's
really,I think to persevere too

459
00:28:40,906 --> 00:28:45,362
is,is you have to avoid getting
overwhelmed and the way.To avoid

460
00:28:45,362 --> 00:28:48,461
getting overwhelmed.At least what
I've learned,and I'm,I'm probably

461
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:51,541
not the first to say it,but it's
like you,you gotta break down the

462
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:55,951
problem,whatever it is.So like,
you know,cuz if you look at,I

463
00:28:55,951 --> 00:29:01,112
don't know,like say for example,
we,you know,Dan wanted to,uh,

464
00:29:01,142 --> 00:29:05,461
redo the entire virtual coffee
site again.For some reason you

465
00:29:05,781 --> 00:29:06,511
would never wanna do that,

466
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,883
Bekah: right?Yeah.That's not
anything you've never ever

467
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:10,622
mentioned recently at

468
00:29:10,622 --> 00:29:13,442
Nick: all.Oh,I didn't,I didn't
even know that.Sorry.So that's,

469
00:29:13,442 --> 00:29:17,942
uh,foreshadowing unintentionally
by me.Sorry,But,but like,you

470
00:29:17,942 --> 00:29:22,471
know,at first glancing you might
be like,oh man,that is gonna take

471
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:26,251
forever.But if,if,you know,and if
you break it down,you know,it's

472
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:30,692
like,okay,well I'm gonna do this
part and this part and,and you

473
00:29:30,692 --> 00:29:35,102
just slowly I'm not gonna look at
the chat.I just saw partially

474
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:36,241
what don't,don't listen to

475
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,571
Bekah: anything Michael says.
Okay.

476
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:43,832
Nick: But,you know,I,I think
breaking it down is,is so good.

477
00:29:43,832 --> 00:29:47,642
And it,and it sounds so obvious
maybe,but like,as you chip away

478
00:29:47,642 --> 00:29:50,582
at something,you know,whether
it's a tough problem or just

479
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:54,602
you're working on a feature or
whatever,it's like every time you

480
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:59,642
finish that task or that piece of
it,you know,it's like looking at

481
00:29:59,642 --> 00:30:02,701
the thing as one piece.You're
like,oh my goodness,it's so much.

482
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:07,471
But like,as you slowly see like,
oh,I've got20tasks done already,

483
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:10,442
and then it's all of a sudden
it's like you,you can see the

484
00:30:10,446 --> 00:30:13,981
momentum and the progress.And I
think,I think that's super

485
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:20,491
helpful.Um,the other thing for me
is like,it it,it's not a,a cocky

486
00:30:20,491 --> 00:30:25,951
thing.It's more even when I don't
know stuff,I'm just,I just know I

487
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:30,152
can learn things now and.I know
if there's something like I'm,

488
00:30:30,152 --> 00:30:32,912
I'm not certain about whatever.I
know,I'll figure it out.I'm,you

489
00:30:32,912 --> 00:30:37,082
know,and,and,and just knowing
that also helps me figure out

490
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:41,071
things.And I'm,I'm trying to
still stay serious for a sec,but

491
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:43,832
I can't cuz Becca's smiling,cuz I
know she's looking at the chat.

492
00:30:47,132 --> 00:30:51,751
Bekah: it's Michael.He's
derailing everything.I'm sorry.

493
00:30:52,842 --> 00:30:56,162
Nick: Apparently I'm a flat
earth.Well,you're not a flat

494
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:59,281
earth.It depends.Well,you just,
you just don't go to the just,

495
00:30:59,287 --> 00:31:01,652
just don't go to the end,you
know?Cuz that's where you'll fall

496
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:10,051
off.Right,Michael?So,uh,it's
true.Anyways,that was my

497
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:13,382
ramblings.I,I don't know if that
was coherent at all for anybody,

498
00:31:13,382 --> 00:31:17,186
but,uh,Oh,oh

499
00:31:17,186 --> 00:31:17,426
Dan: damn.

500
00:31:17,426 --> 00:31:19,217
Bekah: Oh man,I didn't see that.
That's part thing of putting

501
00:31:19,217 --> 00:31:22,636
comments up.Oh,here we go.All.So
what are you doing?Add the

502
00:31:22,636 --> 00:31:26,146
banners like you're supposed to.
Was a earth.No,don't take away

503
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:29,626
that banner.We don't want that
one Good one

504
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:35,686
Nick: around accepting.We live,
live on a round.

505
00:31:35,906 --> 00:31:37,846
Bekah: We just started using
Streamy Yard.We're just getting

506
00:31:37,846 --> 00:31:38,446
used to this.

507
00:31:38,446 --> 00:31:38,926
Nick: Friends.

508
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:42,017
Dan: Yeah.Yeah.It's,it is a new
tool.I learned a couple things

509
00:31:42,017 --> 00:31:45,467
today during the,during the
Lightning talks.Um,it's good,

510
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:47,116
Bekah: good to learn while you're
live.Right.

511
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:48,287
Nick: So I,I forgot

512
00:31:48,287 --> 00:31:52,866
Dan: to share this with Bekah,
but I,I figured out.So when you

513
00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:57,856
are hosting a thing on Dreamyard,
in an event,if you invite guests,

514
00:31:58,007 --> 00:32:02,356
they can like start sharing
their,and it doesn't show up,you

515
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:06,017
know?And then you as the host can
like,activate it,you know?Yeah.

516
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:08,507
But I shared my story.No,I'm
saying,I'm saying,this is what

517
00:32:08,507 --> 00:32:11,807
I'm saying.If,if,if you're the
host,if you're a hosts or like a

518
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:15,047
member host,like,you know,Sobek
and I are both like account.

519
00:32:15,497 --> 00:32:19,547
Owners or whatever.Uh,when you
start sharing it,it goes up no

520
00:32:19,547 --> 00:32:22,576
matter what is all already
happening.Um,both Beck and I

521
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:24,438
discovered that I,I did that,
which I did not

522
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:28,307
Bekah: know.I shared my,I didn't
my slides Yeah.During,sorry,

523
00:32:28,307 --> 00:32:32,116
Brian Meeker.Yeah.During his
obsidian talk and it went up

524
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:36,826
there and like,luckily I feel
like I pretty quickly recognize

525
00:32:36,826 --> 00:32:41,267
that like,this is not good and I
took it down and I was able to

526
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:44,656
switch it.Yeah.But I did not
anticipate that when I shared my,

527
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:47,386
I thought I was gonna go
backstage and dreamyard.It did

528
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:49,356
not go,go backstage.It went,
would've

529
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:51,797
Nick: straight up would've.Okay.
Yeah.I would've assumed it

530
00:32:51,876 --> 00:32:54,317
would've.We're calling you out
first too.Yeah,yeah,

531
00:32:54,317 --> 00:32:56,207
Dan: yeah.There might be some
setting,you know,that I haven't

532
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,957
found yet.Uh,no.I did the exact
same thing to Gantt,uh,this

533
00:32:59,957 --> 00:33:04,156
morning at the beginning.Um,so
apologies to Gantt too.It was a

534
00:33:04,156 --> 00:33:08,477
couple,a second of my slide while
he was still talking.So,and he

535
00:33:08,477 --> 00:33:11,596
didn't have any slides,so it was
even more,you know,like.

536
00:33:12,842 --> 00:33:17,071
Disruptive Cause it was just like
Gantt and then it was my slide

537
00:33:17,071 --> 00:33:19,382
and Gantt,and then it was Gantt
again.So,yeah.Whatcha are you

538
00:33:19,382 --> 00:33:19,622
gonna do

539
00:33:20,461 --> 00:33:22,652
Nick: Good.John cracked me up.
GT's awesome.

540
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:27,721
Bekah: G Gantt is amazing.His
talk is always so good.And his

541
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:33,422
was,um,the title of his talk.
Give me a second and grab it.Um,

542
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:40,561
it was,nope,I did not grab it.I
clicked the wrong thing.Where did

543
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:47,402
that we're doing right here at
Virtual Coffee.Do you know?Okay.

544
00:33:47,612 --> 00:33:48,842
Do you have it up,Dan?

545
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:51,271
Dan: What?No.

546
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:51,932
Nick: Oh,

547
00:33:51,932 --> 00:33:52,112
here

548
00:33:52,112 --> 00:33:59,132
Bekah: we conquering your stage
one laugh at a time.And Gant is

549
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:03,511
incredibly funny and has been
very impactful in my speaking

550
00:34:03,517 --> 00:34:10,067
career.So everything he says is
like,it's gold.I just like,Eat it

551
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:14,117
up.Well,you can't really eat up
gold.I,it's like pepper.

552
00:34:14,117 --> 00:34:17,297
Nick: Well,it's malleable.So
like,drink it.You could maybe,

553
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:20,507
yeah,there's gold swagger.Uh,is
that,I can't remember.Is that

554
00:34:20,507 --> 00:34:23,817
real gold?In gold swagger?I feel
like it is.You think it is?I

555
00:34:23,817 --> 00:34:29,657
think it is.No,it's for sure.
Okay.Yeah.Um,yeah.Um,what was I

556
00:34:29,657 --> 00:34:33,376
gonna say?Uh,yeah,no,just,just a
shout out to the Lightning Talks.

557
00:34:33,376 --> 00:34:36,016
I mean,I tweeted out before,but
they were all really great.But

558
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:42,286
the other thing that,uh,I really
like,uh,about virtual Coffee with

559
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:45,016
the Lightning Talks,and then we
also have lunch and learns for

560
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,987
folks who aren't aware that might
just be catching this podcast for

561
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:52,036
the first time.It's,there's,
there's a lot of people in the

562
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:56,327
community who were reluctant to
give talks initially,either outta

563
00:34:56,327 --> 00:35:01,097
shyness or maybe a bit of lack of
confidence and the Lunch and

564
00:35:01,097 --> 00:35:04,847
Learns.They've been so great for
so many people that I've seen

565
00:35:04,847 --> 00:35:08,791
because like,I'm.I'm extroverted
and like I'm the kind of person

566
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:12,992
that will just talk to a random
person like anywhere.But I know

567
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:17,132
not everybody's like that.And it
was just the,the lunch and Learns

568
00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:19,681
have been great for that because
it's like a welcoming space where

569
00:35:19,681 --> 00:35:24,856
people can just,you know,be in a
safe space to.One,give the talk,

570
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:28,396
but also,you know,get,you know,
great feedback from people and

571
00:35:28,396 --> 00:35:31,666
it's,it's a,it's a great space
for people to just keep improving

572
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:35,086
on,on their public speaking.And
the Lightning Talks are great for

573
00:35:35,086 --> 00:35:39,527
that as well too.And,uh,I'm,I'm
smiling again cuz I see Bekah

574
00:35:39,532 --> 00:35:42,556
smiling and now I'm gonna look at
the chat and see what Triple B is

575
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:42,797
written.

576
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:48,036
Bekah: Yep,yep.That's,that's
about it.Well,and you know,that

577
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:50,266
is like one of the great things
that's happened over the past

578
00:35:50,266 --> 00:35:52,697
couple years at Virtual Coffee.
And one of the things I've been

579
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:56,597
thinking about a lot very
recently too,it's like our,our

580
00:35:56,597 --> 00:36:00,257
mission is to be a welcoming tech
community that allows room for

581
00:36:00,257 --> 00:36:03,617
growth and mentorship at all
levels to create meaningful

582
00:36:03,617 --> 00:36:06,407
opportunities for learning,
leadership and contribution for

583
00:36:06,836 --> 00:36:10,246
everyone.And we say that all the
time,and I can rattle it off like

584
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:17,327
I just did,but,but like I,we
spend a lot of time thinking

585
00:36:17,327 --> 00:36:22,202
through those things.and
Lightning Ducks is a big part of

586
00:36:22,202 --> 00:36:27,572
that because it allows people who
have never been speakers to

587
00:36:27,572 --> 00:36:32,431
participate.It allows people to
learn in a way that they feel

588
00:36:32,431 --> 00:36:35,552
comfortable because they know
they can go to a speaker at

589
00:36:35,556 --> 00:36:39,481
Virtual Coffee who they never
talk to before,but they're

590
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:46,351
connected in that space to ask
those questions.And so I really

591
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:51,061
love the Lightning talks and I'd
love to see them happen more than

592
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:56,851
once or twice a year.Um,yeah.But
like it's,it's all part of that,

593
00:36:56,851 --> 00:37:01,592
like that growing and sharing and
stuff that we do.Yeah.And that's

594
00:37:01,592 --> 00:37:02,222
one of my favorite

595
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:02,521
things

596
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:08,641
Nick: to.Yeah.And,uh,uh,there's
been a lot of organic growth in

597
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:13,922
the community in the sense that
like,like,like for for folks who

598
00:37:13,922 --> 00:37:17,851
are already in virtual coffee,
like the norm might just seem to

599
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:20,746
be,you go in the slack and
there's the automated,join

600
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:23,911
today's virtual coffee and the
Zoom starts.But that,that's not

601
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:29,882
how it began.Like,uh,I,I,a long
time ago,uh,I won't say in a

602
00:37:29,882 --> 00:37:36,081
galaxy far away or whatever,but I
will,um,you can do it.I,I can't

603
00:37:36,202 --> 00:37:42,077
remember.Exactly how I started
talking to Bekah.But like,uh,

604
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:46,067
when I worked at Dev two,uh,we
had acquired Code Newbie.And Code

605
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:51,436
Newbie had this Twitter,uh,
check-in.And I remember Bekah,I

606
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,717
don't even remember what she
wrote in there,but,uh,I was

607
00:37:53,717 --> 00:37:56,327
trying to be helpful and I was
like,oh,try this or something.

608
00:37:56,516 --> 00:38:02,086
And,but then after that,I'm not
sure how,but like you showed up

609
00:38:02,086 --> 00:38:05,387
on my timeline,or maybe I gave
you a follow,I don't remember,

610
00:38:05,387 --> 00:38:10,697
but I saw you tweet out.This is
like April,2020.Uh,hey,does

611
00:38:10,697 --> 00:38:16,217
anybody wanna meet for virtual
coffee?And I was just like,I,I

612
00:38:16,217 --> 00:38:21,887
just,you know,uh,it was,it felt a
little weird,but I,I Dmd,I dmd

613
00:38:21,891 --> 00:38:26,882
you,I was like,uh,hey.Um,Is it
okay if I come to virtual coffee?

614
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:31,322
And you know,and it was literally
the,the first Zooms were like,

615
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:34,351
you were literally saying,here's
the link in like a Twitter dm.

616
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:37,532
Yep.And then all dm,that's how it
started.Yeah.And then I don't

617
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:39,512
think we even had Slack yet at
that

618
00:38:39,512 --> 00:38:42,871
Bekah: point.No.No.And I had to
be talked into Slack.There was

619
00:38:42,871 --> 00:38:45,902
somebody that,like early on was
like,I started a Slack and I was

620
00:38:45,902 --> 00:38:49,652
like,I don't know about that.
Like,that seems like a lot of

621
00:38:49,652 --> 00:38:53,192
stuff.I don't know.And we're not,
we're not doing a lot of stuff

622
00:38:54,152 --> 00:38:59,777
and then,A couple months later,I
am pretty sure,as Brian Healy was

623
00:38:59,777 --> 00:39:02,896
like,Hey,slack would be really
good to keep up these

624
00:39:02,896 --> 00:39:05,597
conversations.And I was like,I
can't handle that.Yeah.And he was

625
00:39:05,597 --> 00:39:08,387
like,well,then I'll start it if
you,if that's cool.And I was

626
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,027
like,all right,you wanna do it?
You go for it.And that's like

627
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:14,657
kind of been the whole thing of
virtual coffee,right?Like,we

628
00:39:14,777 --> 00:39:18,257
always wanna support people with
what they wanna do.Like,Hey,you

629
00:39:18,257 --> 00:39:22,217
got an idea,we're here to support
you.Go for it.You know?Yeah.And

630
00:39:22,217 --> 00:39:25,606
so it's not about like waiting
for the things that we are doing,

631
00:39:25,612 --> 00:39:29,117
it's about like,you do the things
that you wanna do and we're here

632
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,646
to give you the support that you
need.

633
00:39:33,226 --> 00:39:36,556
Nick: Yeah.And there's been like,
just so many things that people

634
00:39:36,556 --> 00:39:39,797
have just done on their own
initiative.Like there's a bunch

635
00:39:39,797 --> 00:39:42,586
of things I don't participate in
just one cuz I'm super busy Yeah.

636
00:39:42,766 --> 00:39:45,766
These days.But there's a lot of
great things out there.There's

637
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:49,036
like the,the tech study group.
There's accountability,bu

638
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:53,956
accountability buddies.I,that's
very difficult to say.Um,it is,

639
00:39:54,106 --> 00:39:55,757
you know,there's the

640
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:59,806
Bekah: front end Friday battles.
Wait,what is it Dan?You know what

641
00:40:00,947 --> 00:40:08,086
Dan: Uh,front end Friday.Lemme
look it up.Front end Friday.

642
00:40:08,092 --> 00:40:10,592
Something,something.A whole bunch
of

643
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:14,612
Nick: Fs.Friday.Friday front end
Friday

644
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,351
Dan: folks fighting CSS Battle.

645
00:40:16,672 --> 00:40:22,411
Nick: That's ok.Okay.But yeah,
there,there's,there's that.Um,

646
00:40:22,952 --> 00:40:25,141
uh,what else is there?There's
just like,I went

647
00:40:25,146 --> 00:40:29,496
Bekah: to my first feelings
Friday today.And that's run by

648
00:40:29,556 --> 00:40:34,626
Ethan and which was inspired by
the founders of Flatiron Group.

649
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,916
And okay.It was like a really
nice space to talk about what was

650
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:43,476
going on in our week,how we felt,
and to be able to identify like

651
00:40:43,717 --> 00:40:48,126
do we want feedback?Do we want to
just vent?Um,and like to

652
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:52,356
establish like what we want out
of that conversation.And so that

653
00:40:52,356 --> 00:40:55,836
was like a really great way.We
had a member who had been here

654
00:40:55,836 --> 00:41:00,726
for a while and then like went
through a lot of personal stuff

655
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:05,407
and dropped out off for a while,
and then he was back and that was

656
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:09,306
one of the first events that he
had coming back in.Like to just

657
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:14,047
be there and to listen.And it was
really,really great to be able to

658
00:41:14,047 --> 00:41:17,706
extend that opportunity because
Ethan thought this would be a

659
00:41:17,706 --> 00:41:20,887
really great space for people to
be able to share what they're

660
00:41:20,891 --> 00:41:21,577
going through.

661
00:41:22,786 --> 00:41:26,297
Nick: That's great.And the,
there,there's other,other things.

662
00:41:26,297 --> 00:41:29,717
And even,even though they're
repeated all the time,uh,I think

663
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:33,376
people appreciate them.Like I
know you always do the Wednesday

664
00:41:33,376 --> 00:41:37,367
check-in,how's everybody doing,
uh,Bekah.Um,and then there's

665
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:41,987
like,you know,uh,Friday,like,
what was your wins and so on.Or

666
00:41:41,987 --> 00:41:46,666
like,how,how are things going too
there,stuff like that.Um,you

667
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:51,527
know,the other thing,you
mentioned it before,but like,I

668
00:41:51,527 --> 00:41:57,106
think it was after,was it
Octoberfest2020or was it2021when

669
00:41:57,106 --> 00:42:01,547
we started really doing a lot of
open source,uh,at virtual coffee.

670
00:42:01,547 --> 00:42:05,777
It was2020,right Dan?Yeah.This is
the first one.Okay.Yeah.You know?

671
00:42:05,777 --> 00:42:09,016
Yeah,that's right.Yeah,yeah.
Yeah.Cuz I was at Dev two and.

672
00:42:09,556 --> 00:42:13,186
Yeah,I remember,uh,cuz I,I was
running octoberfest,well not

673
00:42:13,186 --> 00:42:16,126
running it,but me and Christina
Gordon,who I used to work with,

674
00:42:16,126 --> 00:42:21,677
we were kind of the face of the
dev two kind of stuff there for

675
00:42:21,677 --> 00:42:24,947
Octoberfest.And then we,I
remember starting to do some

676
00:42:24,947 --> 00:42:29,717
stuff,uh,with virtual coffee and
then Kirk started up some stuff

677
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:32,516
and then there was like,you know,
like,you know,if you're a

678
00:42:32,757 --> 00:42:35,927
maintainer,you know,like this is
some things you can do and stuff.

679
00:42:35,927 --> 00:42:39,106
And then,and then,I can't
remember,maybe you can speak to

680
00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:42,436
this that,cause I can't remember
when the site came about,but at

681
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:46,757
some point I think you put up the
site and then,and then we,it was

682
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:50,507
open source.So then people from
the community,well also people

683
00:42:50,507 --> 00:42:53,536
outside the community I guess.
But you know,that was a great way

684
00:42:53,536 --> 00:42:56,027
to start getting people in a open
source,I think as,

685
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:59,777
Dan: Yeah,it was that first,it
was that first,uh,Hector Fest,

686
00:42:59,896 --> 00:43:04,967
you know,I made the first version
of the,of,so,you know,Karen made

687
00:43:04,972 --> 00:43:08,867
this site,uh,the first version of
site.It was like a single pager,

688
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:13,666
you know,nice little single page
thing.And then to basically

689
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:18,556
create some issues for Hector
Fest,we created the,like,similar

690
00:43:18,556 --> 00:43:21,016
to the current version of the
site.It was built on11at,at

691
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:24,376
first,but that's right when we
got onto Nefi,like I was talking

692
00:43:24,376 --> 00:43:27,617
about before,um,and all that
stuff.And,and it looks very

693
00:43:27,617 --> 00:43:31,157
similar to how it looks now.Um,
okay.You know,we've just added

694
00:43:31,157 --> 00:43:35,597
things to it since then.And at
some point,yeah,in the last year,

695
00:43:35,896 --> 00:43:43,487
uh,switched over to remix instead
of,um,11.But yeah,it was,yeah,it

696
00:43:43,492 --> 00:43:46,967
was,it was,it was to do that,to
encourage our members to kind of

697
00:43:46,972 --> 00:43:51,242
get into a open door.So we
figured out a,a way to.The the

698
00:43:51,242 --> 00:43:55,532
members page,you know,is,is all,
uh,people add their own profile,

699
00:43:55,532 --> 00:44:00,271
like files to the repository.
Yeah.To,um,get their member,you

700
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:04,141
know,profile onto the site.And,
um,that was like the big,you

701
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,981
know,the,the big push for our
Hector fist thing,you know,you

702
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:11,552
can get one pool request for free
right here.I mean,you have to do

703
00:44:11,552 --> 00:44:13,952
something,you know,you still have
to Yeah,do a poll request and all

704
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:18,887
that stuff.Um,but.It was cool.
And I,and I feel like it was

705
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:20,146
pretty successful.Yeah.Um,

706
00:44:20,836 --> 00:44:24,436
Nick: yeah,I,I,I thought that was
a super fun way to get people

707
00:44:24,436 --> 00:44:27,646
kind of kickstarted into open
source,cuz it's something you can

708
00:44:27,646 --> 00:44:30,527
see,like it's literally your
picture on the virtual coffee

709
00:44:30,532 --> 00:44:34,547
site,uh,or whatever you use for
your avatar for GitHub.So yeah,I

710
00:44:34,552 --> 00:44:39,746
thought it was super fun.Um,
dealing with distractions.Yeah.

711
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:43,336
Yeah.Sorry,I'm looking Yeah.I'm
looking at the chat again.Yeah,

00:44:46,606 --> 00:44:49,186
lightning talk on,uh,

00:44:56,987 --> 00:45:01,277

00:45:05,887 --> 00:45:10,637
Bekah: reward for being
distracting in the chat?Oh,he's

00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,097

00:47:32,597 --> 00:47:35,447
productizing it now,so like it's,
it is open source,but it's,

756
00:47:35,476 --> 00:47:39,286
they're actually working on a
product now.But,uh,it's such a,a

757
00:47:39,286 --> 00:47:41,927
great welcoming community and
it's like,it's a place I

758
00:47:41,927 --> 00:47:45,226
consistently tell people to go to
if they're starting to get into

759
00:47:45,226 --> 00:47:50,056
open source.It's,uh,Brian's a big
fan of like,you know,good first

00:47:50,056 --> 00:47:51,916
issues,so,uh,it's a great.

761
00:47:54,737 --> 00:47:57,106
Bekah: Okay,listen,I'm gonna have
to deal with this chat because

762
00:47:57,106 --> 00:48:01,987
they're getting outta hand.All
right?Like I am not excluding any

763
00:48:01,987 --> 00:48:06,646
of any of you.James,you can have
an invite into our Slack.You've

764
00:48:06,646 --> 00:48:10,336
come to virtual coffee before
Michael.You need to join the wait

765
00:48:10,336 --> 00:48:13,396
list,or you need to find an
active volunteer who is willing

766
00:48:13,396 --> 00:48:16,126
to allow you to come into virtual
coffee,cuz that's how we do

767
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:19,157
Nick: it.Here I,I'll,I'll hook
you up,Michael.Even though you

768
00:48:19,157 --> 00:48:21,737
told me I'm a flat Earth Yeah.

769
00:48:21,976 --> 00:48:25,277
Bekah: Well,how dare you,
Michael.And look how nice Nick is

770
00:48:25,427 --> 00:48:28,306
to invite you,even though you
accused him of such

771
00:48:28,387 --> 00:48:33,467
Nick: things.Well,if the Earth's
flat,so if I just kind of push

772
00:48:33,467 --> 00:48:37,487
the invite,it should just slide
across to,uh,I forget where

773
00:48:37,487 --> 00:48:42,137
Michael lives.Is it not
Louisiana?Uh,Alabama.Alabama.

774
00:48:42,141 --> 00:48:42,467
That's it.

775
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:49,472
Bekah: Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Michael
could never give a lightning

776
00:48:49,472 --> 00:48:52,831
talk.That's true.And then Chad,
he says,I,I Bekah knows that I

777
00:48:52,831 --> 00:48:56,612
could never give a lightning
talk.What's the time limit?we're

778
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:01,532
a little over today.Um,we went a
half an hour past what we

779
00:49:01,532 --> 00:49:08,791
anticipated was going to happen.
Um,there,there was,yep,

780
00:49:09,242 --> 00:49:09,541
Nick: go ahead.

781
00:49:09,782 --> 00:49:12,362
Dan: Mean if it was only a half
an hour and there it's11people

782
00:49:12,572 --> 00:49:15,422
outside,only a half an hour.
That's two and a half minutes per

783
00:49:15,422 --> 00:49:20,311
person.That's not that bad.You
know,promptness.Dan also,uh,I,

784
00:49:20,972 --> 00:49:23,492
Bekah told me today,she always
just plans on me going over

785
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:27,121
Nick: is,but always goes over.

786
00:49:27,512 --> 00:49:29,072
Bekah: He has never once not gone

787
00:49:29,072 --> 00:49:30,692
Nick: over.That's fair.I

788
00:49:30,692 --> 00:49:34,487
Dan: guess,but also,How dare you
is all I wanted

789
00:49:34,487 --> 00:49:34,547
Nick: to

790
00:49:34,547 --> 00:49:37,967
Bekah: say.I go last so it
doesn't matter if I go over or

791
00:49:37,967 --> 00:49:39,936
not.So I have the fewest

792
00:49:40,496 --> 00:49:43,056
Dan: times.Becca's.Yeah,I

793
00:49:43,277 --> 00:49:45,737
Nick: noticed he didn't volunteer
to go all coming out,all the

794
00:49:45,737 --> 00:49:47,896
dirty laundry's coming out right
now.I tried

795
00:49:47,896 --> 00:49:52,367
Bekah: to gear my talk to be the
last talk cuz I was also the mz

796
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:57,496
and it's weird if the mc also
gives a talk.Okay.So I tried to.

797
00:49:59,056 --> 00:50:04,007
Curate it to be that last piece
of thing.I like that.Thanks.

798
00:50:04,306 --> 00:50:08,476
Thanks James.Quack.Yes.You
noticed that I am flexing the VC

799
00:50:08,481 --> 00:50:10,786
mug.Oh,yeah.In our store

800
00:50:10,786 --> 00:50:14,317
Nick: right now.I gotta,I gotta
grab one of those.Uh,

801
00:50:14,317 --> 00:50:17,266
Bekah: I gotta send you one.Like
I said,I was going to the

802
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:18,646
Dan: enamel one here.

803
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:21,851
Nick: Okay.Okay.Look at you all
fancy.Yeah.

804
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:24,041
Dan: Well,I'm not gonna drink
outta it.Got a poly work one.It

805
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:27,192
doesn't have anything in it
because,um,if you put anything

806
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:28,751
hot in it,it burns you.

807
00:50:30,492 --> 00:50:32,592
Nick: Okay,so don't buy it.You
drink coffee

808
00:50:32,592 --> 00:50:37,871
Dan: for a mug?Yeah.Uh,I mean,I
didn't,I don't know.I test,I

809
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:40,181
didn't know that until I tested
it out.So,I mean,it's still in

810
00:50:40,181 --> 00:50:43,572
the store if you want get it,but
just like be warned if you get

811
00:50:43,572 --> 00:50:44,681
the enamel one.Yeah.

812
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:48,041
Nick: If,if you're looking to
burn your hands,even the handle

813
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:48,552
Dan: gets hot.

814
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:52,541
Bekah: like you can't find out
more about our

815
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:57,851
merch@virtualcoffee.io slash
store.Is that what it is?Are

816
00:50:57,851 --> 00:50:59,262
Dan: you're asking me?I,I,I'm
pretty sure

817
00:50:59,262 --> 00:51:02,411
Nick: that's right.Yeah.I,I can't
tell if Becca's gonna sneeze or

818
00:51:02,411 --> 00:51:05,172
if she's just making funny eyes
squinting for some reason.I'm not

819
00:51:05,172 --> 00:51:05,831
sure what's going.I,

820
00:51:06,012 --> 00:51:09,782
Bekah: I'm making,so that's how I
concentrate.Breaking news.One.

821
00:51:09,782 --> 00:51:10,021
Nick: Eye

822
00:51:10,331 --> 00:51:16,181
Dan: breaking news.Don't go to
slash store So No,that's a404.I

823
00:51:16,181 --> 00:51:20,141
mean,any of our things you can
always just go to the normal

824
00:51:20,141 --> 00:51:24,512
site.Virtual coffee and find
links to everything else.Uh,the

825
00:51:24,512 --> 00:51:28,561
link to our store is store
virtual coffee io.

826
00:51:28,742 --> 00:51:30,271
Nick: Okay.I just had in the

827
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:33,001
Dan: wrong,I probably should add
a redirect for,you know.

828
00:51:33,271 --> 00:51:35,222
Nick: Yeah,you probably should.
That probably,you probably should

829
00:51:35,222 --> 00:51:39,001
do that thing.It,it,it is,uh,
it's one of those age old

830
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:41,641
questions.When do you do
sub-domain versus just like a

831
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:43,021
path?Well,it's

832
00:51:43,021 --> 00:51:46,141
Dan: like Shopify and all that
stuff,so,you know,yeah.It's a

833
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:50,161
little,uh,more complicated to try
to have it on a subdomain or,I

834
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:55,652
mean,not have it on a subdomain,
but regardless,store dot virtual

835
00:51:55,652 --> 00:51:56,641
coffee.io.

836
00:51:56,911 --> 00:52:00,001
Nick: What a great store.I'm
gonna make squinting.I'm,I'm

837
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:01,981
doing terrible ice pointing now.
Yes.That's what

838
00:52:01,981 --> 00:52:05,012
Bekah: I do.I do the squinting
eye.It's always the right eye.

839
00:52:05,101 --> 00:52:09,512
You gotta get the right eye.And
that's what why was in the case

840
00:52:09,512 --> 00:52:12,362
that you're thinking?Because I'm
thinking,okay,

841
00:52:12,452 --> 00:52:16,681
Dan: yesterday I was trying to
open a glue thing and it was like

842
00:52:16,681 --> 00:52:21,001
this little craft kit for Ben,
my,my seven year year old.And

843
00:52:21,001 --> 00:52:22,952
there's like this like tube of,
you know,it was just a little

844
00:52:22,952 --> 00:52:25,742
white glue,but it was,and we have
like tons of glue,but like the

845
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:31,202
craft kit came with glue,you
know,and.It looked like it was

846
00:52:31,202 --> 00:52:33,961
open,but it wasn't.No glue was
coming out.I started squeezing it

847
00:52:34,291 --> 00:52:38,041
and looked at it and then shot
myself right in the eye with glue

848
00:52:38,762 --> 00:52:44,702
Oh,it came out,it came out,uh,
very suddenly and with,it

849
00:52:44,702 --> 00:52:45,722
Nick: wasn't crazy.The

850
00:52:45,722 --> 00:52:48,331
Dan: velocity?No,no,it was just
like white glue.It was just like

851
00:52:48,452 --> 00:52:51,782
Elmer's,you know,what is
essentially Elmer's glue?Uh,

852
00:52:52,052 --> 00:52:55,161
Nick: okay.So ultimately you can
practically eat that stuff.You,

853
00:52:55,442 --> 00:52:58,262
you know,put that on pasta with a
bit of salt,you know?For sure,

854
00:52:58,262 --> 00:52:58,771
for sure.But it

855
00:52:58,771 --> 00:53:00,992
Dan: was not,uh,my favorite thing
in the world.I mean,and of course

856
00:53:00,996 --> 00:53:03,271
it was like it was in my eyes,so
I couldn't actually do anything

857
00:53:03,271 --> 00:53:05,552
else,but it was also on my shirt
and also all over,over the floor

858
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:09,032
and,uh,on the kitchen table as
well.So it was,it was a large

859
00:53:09,032 --> 00:53:13,141
mess.And,uh,for once it was all
my fault,I couldn't blame it on

860
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:15,782
the kids even a little bit,uh,
that time.So,you

861
00:53:15,782 --> 00:53:18,271
Nick: know,you,you could have put
the glue in front of the kid,

862
00:53:18,271 --> 00:53:20,431
like,oh,Ben,what did you do?

863
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:22,922
Dan: Oh,yeah.Why'd you shoot me
in the eye with the glue?Yeah.

864
00:53:23,072 --> 00:53:27,452
Yeah.Well,I,I wasn't thinking
very clearly because I had glue

865
00:53:27,452 --> 00:53:32,387
in my eye.So it's a good call
though,Nick.You're you're right,

866
00:53:32,387 --> 00:53:32,836
you're absolutely

867
00:53:32,836 --> 00:53:37,126
Nick: right.Would,uh,glad it
wasn't crazy glue though,cuz Oh

868
00:53:37,126 --> 00:53:40,237
yeah.That would've been
disastrous.Yeah,that would've

869
00:53:40,237 --> 00:53:45,467
been very bad.Crazy glue is good
though for,well,it's probably not

870
00:53:45,467 --> 00:53:49,606
medically sound to say this,but
I've crazy glued my head before

871
00:53:49,606 --> 00:53:53,806
from like,like,cuz when I played
rugby,like I've split my head

872
00:53:53,806 --> 00:53:57,947
open so many times and like,you
know,I,I'd usually get stitches

873
00:53:57,947 --> 00:54:01,516
and stuff,but the,the thing with
stitches is if you don't get them

874
00:54:01,516 --> 00:54:06,197
handled like quickly,like the,
you're gonna end up with a

875
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:09,226
massive scar because like,it
doesn't,like it literally starts

876
00:54:09,226 --> 00:54:13,067
healing incorrectly.And nowadays,
like if you go to the doctor,

877
00:54:13,067 --> 00:54:16,996
depending on the size of.You
know,the,the amount of stitches

878
00:54:16,996 --> 00:54:19,666
you need.A lot of times if it's
kind of tiny,they'll,they'll

879
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:24,137
actually use medical grade,crazy
glue now.But,uh,I feel like I

880
00:54:24,137 --> 00:54:27,737
might have pioneered that in the
late nineties by just saying,I,

881
00:54:27,737 --> 00:54:30,976
uh,I need to stitch myself up.So
I,I mean,

882
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:35,146
Bekah: I,I will provide you with
stitches anytime you want.Just

883
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:39,677
let,lemme know.Oh my gosh.All
I've wanted to do in my life is

884
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:42,766
to stitch somebody up.I'm pretty
sure I'd be very

885
00:54:42,766 --> 00:54:44,536
Dan: good.It's fourth time.It's
fourth time today.You've been

886
00:54:44,536 --> 00:54:45,856
offering medical advice by God?

887
00:54:46,217 --> 00:54:46,396
Nick: No.

888
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:50,567
Bekah: Okay.Did I,but I have told
on the podcast before,once I

889
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:53,777
almost gave stitches to somebody,
did I get,did I tell that story

890
00:54:53,782 --> 00:54:55,547
before?Uh,

891
00:54:55,577 --> 00:54:56,956
Nick: let's hear it.I don't think
so.Yeah.

892
00:54:57,467 --> 00:55:01,936
Bekah: When I was a freshman in
college,I was friends with a lot

893
00:55:01,996 --> 00:55:06,106
of the hockey team and somebody
came home and had a pretty big

894
00:55:06,106 --> 00:55:11,056
gash on their head and I was
like,I could handle that for you.

895
00:55:11,626 --> 00:55:17,266
I've had a lot of stitches in my
life.And so as we were gathering

896
00:55:17,327 --> 00:55:21,617
the materials and he was totally
down with it,he was like,yeah,

897
00:55:21,646 --> 00:55:24,706
you can gimme stitches.That's
totally like,yeah,you've had

898
00:55:24,706 --> 00:55:28,007
stitches,you know what you're
doing.Sure you can give stitches.

899
00:55:28,577 --> 00:55:32,987
And so somebody was going to go
get some,a sewing kit and some

900
00:55:32,987 --> 00:55:39,016
sterilization materials and,and
then the um,uh,ra the resident

901
00:55:39,016 --> 00:55:44,416
hall director came and was like,
you may not give him stitches.

902
00:55:44,987 --> 00:55:49,456
You must leave right now.So I was
like very,very close to being

903
00:55:49,456 --> 00:55:53,327
able to give someone else
stitches.So it is okay.It is my,

904
00:55:53,447 --> 00:56:00,047
um,lifelong journey to be able to
provide medical care to somebody

905
00:56:00,317 --> 00:56:04,547
since I have a master's in
English and I have been in tech

906
00:56:04,552 --> 00:56:06,137
for a couple of years.So,

907
00:56:06,286 --> 00:56:09,436
Nick: so that,that's,that's
practically you,that's that's

908
00:56:09,436 --> 00:56:12,226
practically a surgeon.So yeah.
Practically,

909
00:56:12,586 --> 00:56:18,226
Bekah: I mean,like.I can follow a
YouTube video and do the thing

910
00:56:18,407 --> 00:56:19,367
just like a little

911
00:56:20,447 --> 00:56:20,806
Nick: stick.

912
00:56:21,407 --> 00:56:22,907
Dan: You had me until YouTube
video

913
00:56:23,836 --> 00:56:26,266
Nick: Yeah.No,I actually alcohol.
You just pour

914
00:56:26,266 --> 00:56:27,947
Bekah: it on there,right?Pour it
on there.

915
00:56:28,007 --> 00:56:28,516
Nick: Yeah.I mean,

916
00:56:29,867 --> 00:56:32,867
Dan: one time,I don't know if
you've ever seen the like bar

917
00:56:33,706 --> 00:56:36,617
video game where it's like
bowling.It's like a,there's a

918
00:56:36,621 --> 00:56:39,706
golf one too,but it,there's a
bowling game where it's like a

919
00:56:39,711 --> 00:56:45,496
ball that you like push,you know,
and it,it's,it's like a,one of

920
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:48,916
those standup video games.And we
used to play this at the bar that

921
00:56:48,922 --> 00:56:52,876
we used to go to.And I,you know,
I mean,I like to win games and so

922
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:56,387
I get like,kind of aggressive
and,um,slammed my hand against

923
00:56:56,387 --> 00:56:59,867
the edge,cut my hand open.Whoa.
At the bar?Not,not like horrible,

924
00:56:59,867 --> 00:57:02,416
you know,but like,it was
definitely like bleeding.And I,

925
00:57:02,487 --> 00:57:05,266
and then I just like turned over,
turned around to the bartender

926
00:57:05,271 --> 00:57:09,722
who I.Pretty well cuz we were
there all the time.And,uh,I said,

927
00:57:09,722 --> 00:57:13,081
Jeanie my hand bleeding cuz of
your game.And she was holding a

928
00:57:13,081 --> 00:57:15,362
bottle of gin and she looked at
me and she's like,oh no.And then

929
00:57:15,362 --> 00:57:17,021
she just poured the bottle of gin
on my hand.

930
00:57:19,172 --> 00:57:20,431
Bekah: Very good.She did the
right

931
00:57:20,431 --> 00:57:23,882
Dan: thing was,you know what I,
no infection,no scar.I'm like,

932
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:24,692
I'm perfectly healed

933
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:30,032
Nick: now.So,okay.Well,I,I,I
gotta,I gotta say to continue on

934
00:57:30,032 --> 00:57:33,211
Becca's story,I actually had
somebody stitch me up who wasn't

935
00:57:33,211 --> 00:57:35,192
a nurse.Yes.So anyway,

936
00:57:35,431 --> 00:57:36,512
Bekah: turned out amazing,right?

937
00:57:37,351 --> 00:57:40,112
Nick: Yeah.Well,I have a scar,I,
I can't remember now,but it's

938
00:57:40,112 --> 00:57:43,831
like under one of my eyes,like,
it,it is from rugby,but like,I

939
00:57:43,831 --> 00:57:47,311
went to,I went to tackle somebody
and like the way,the way you're

940
00:57:47,681 --> 00:57:51,481
supposed to tackle somebody,like
a,a textbook tackle is you,you,

941
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:54,422
you grab your arms and you wrap
it around their legs and like,

942
00:57:54,422 --> 00:57:56,942
the side of your head is kind of
like on their butt cheek and you

943
00:57:56,942 --> 00:58:00,782
kind of,you kind of just dump
'em.Uh,that didn't happen.And so

944
00:58:00,782 --> 00:58:05,402
like,I basically got two cleats
into my face.Oh.And so like,I had

945
00:58:05,402 --> 00:58:08,972
like,It was like this gash here.
I can't remember which side.I can

946
00:58:08,972 --> 00:58:12,672
never tell.But,um,if you get
closer to the camera,I'm be able

947
00:58:12,672 --> 00:58:15,961
to tell you.Yeah,yeah,yeah.I
can't tell.I think it's this

948
00:58:15,961 --> 00:58:21,751
side.Uh,no,this side.That's my
nose Anyways,but,uh,and it was,

949
00:58:21,751 --> 00:58:26,972
it was my first year playing in
university and it was,uh,rookie

950
00:58:26,972 --> 00:58:31,952
night,that night.Um,and my
roommate,or no,it wasn't my

951
00:58:31,952 --> 00:58:35,492
roommate,it was like one of the
senior guys.He's,I told him like,

952
00:58:35,496 --> 00:58:40,742
I'm at the hospital,uh,I'm gonna
be late.And he is like,just,just

953
00:58:40,831 --> 00:58:44,612
tell them to give you the
stitches and stuff.And the,I

954
00:58:44,612 --> 00:58:48,601
asked the nurse there and she's
like,you,this never happened.And

955
00:58:48,601 --> 00:58:53,521
she just gave me like the,uh,the
needle,the stitches,and like the

956
00:58:53,521 --> 00:59:00,947
stair strips.And then I went back
to my,my room.And,uh,took a

957
00:59:00,947 --> 00:59:05,507
couple shots of tequila and then
rubbed ice on my face and then he

958
00:59:05,507 --> 00:59:11,356
just sewed it up and,uh,yeah,I'm
still here.So.And nice.It was

959
00:59:11,806 --> 00:59:14,146
hopefully sterile.I mean,uh,what
did,

960
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:18,436
Dan: what kind of,did you use
just thread from like a So kit?

961
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,766
Nick: No,no.Like they,they
literally gave a,a stitching kit

962
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,467
from like,like what they would
use in the hospital.It's just

963
00:59:24,467 --> 00:59:27,797
nice.They,they're not supposed to
give those out,you know.But the

964
00:59:27,802 --> 00:59:31,036
nurse,the nurse clearly,cuz it
was a small town.The university I

965
00:59:31,036 --> 00:59:34,637
was in,the nurse knew I was on
the rugby team and she knew I was

966
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:38,117
going to a rookie party or like
just a party.So she's just like,

967
00:59:38,327 --> 00:59:41,266
she's just like,it's the end of
my shift.Take this,I don't care.

968
00:59:41,266 --> 00:59:44,717
But this never happened kind of
thing.Oh man.So shout out to that

969
00:59:44,722 --> 00:59:47,567
nurse.I'm sorry I don't remember
your name,but shout out

970
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:50,146
Dan: nurses are the best.

971
00:59:53,342 --> 00:59:55,501
Nick: I can't stop reading triple
pieces.I know,

972
00:59:55,891 --> 00:59:59,641
Bekah: same.Okay,Michael,we're
done being distracted by you.

973
00:59:59,822 --> 01:00:03,661
It's been an hour since we've
been here and that is where our

974
01:00:03,661 --> 01:00:09,481
podcast ends.So we wanna thank
Nick for being here during this

975
01:00:09,487 --> 01:00:15,362
podcast episode.Listen,Nick,this
season we've been doing a one

976
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:18,601
word description of what your
career journey has looked like,

977
01:00:18,842 --> 01:00:22,561
and I've given you absolutely no
preparation to think about what

978
01:00:22,561 --> 01:00:29,431
that one word is,but I'm gonna
ask you about it now,as I like,

979
01:00:29,581 --> 01:00:33,512
try and push through this
congestion that I have going

980
01:00:33,512 --> 01:00:38,612
right now.sorry for everybody
that heard me.Sniffling,what is

981
01:00:38,612 --> 01:00:41,132
your one word of your developer?

982
01:00:43,322 --> 01:00:47,251
Nick: Yeah.It's like,it,it's,you
know,when we had the first

983
01:00:47,371 --> 01:00:50,192
podcast episode,I,I said
structured yolo,it's something I

984
01:00:50,192 --> 01:00:54,061
kind of made up on the fly,but
favorite,but I,I really do mean

985
01:00:54,061 --> 01:00:57,331
it.And it's like when people hear
the term yolo,they think like

986
01:00:57,362 --> 01:01:00,121
maybe Red Bull based jumping
stuff like that.That's not what I

987
01:01:00,152 --> 01:01:05,521
mean in in that context.It's
really like the first,you know,

988
01:01:05,911 --> 01:01:11,581
whenever opportunities appear for
you,uh,basically strongly

989
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,476
consider taking them because one,
not everybody gets those

990
01:01:14,702 --> 01:01:21,902
opportunities.And you know,the
other thing is like,even if it's

991
01:01:21,902 --> 01:01:24,541
something you're like,I don't
know if I can do everything

992
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:29,161
that's in this thing or whatever,
in my experience,like just

993
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:33,976
getting outta your comfort zone
as well,that and.Just taking

994
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:36,197
opportunities that present
themselves,you know,assuming

995
01:01:36,197 --> 01:01:40,996
there's no major red flags,you
know,uh,it's,it's changed my

996
01:01:41,056 --> 01:01:46,847
career trajectory,like immensely.
And it's like,I,I,you know,I love

997
01:01:46,847 --> 01:01:50,806
getting outta my comfort zone
now,and it's,you know,it's always

998
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:53,387
the same thing initially.It's
like,ah,my brain hurts.I don't

999
01:01:53,387 --> 01:01:58,217
get something,or whatever.But
then you get past that and,uh,

1000
01:01:58,277 --> 01:02:02,327
you know,aside from that,just,
you know,it's gonna sound cheesy,

1001
01:02:02,327 --> 01:02:07,907
but like,uh,just being kind to
people,you know,like,uh,it goes a

1002
01:02:07,911 --> 01:02:11,896
long way,you know,like it's,it's
not just your developer skills.

1003
01:02:11,902 --> 01:02:18,646
Like,uh,I,I think in my career,
like people have enjoyed working

1004
01:02:18,646 --> 01:02:21,512
with me and.And I don't mean
that,I'm not trying to say that

1005
01:02:21,512 --> 01:02:25,231
in a cocky way.I just mean just
by being fine and kind,that

1006
01:02:25,262 --> 01:02:29,581
changes like a whole dynamic of,
of like the people you work with

1007
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:34,831
and all those things together
have just made my career pretty,

1008
01:02:34,862 --> 01:02:39,512
pretty successful I think so,uh,
that's what I would say.Yeah.And

1009
01:02:39,512 --> 01:02:39,842
I'll just,

1010
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:45,092
Bekah: I just wanna add to that
because it's impacted my career

1011
01:02:45,092 --> 01:02:49,922
immensely to be able to learn
from you Nick,and to have that

1012
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:56,161
understanding and to know that I
can go to you if I need career

1013
01:02:56,251 --> 01:02:59,641
advice,if I need support,if I
have a question that I don't

1014
01:02:59,641 --> 01:03:04,442
know.And like that idea of
structured YOLO is one of my

1015
01:03:04,442 --> 01:03:08,882
favorite things since starting
virtual coffee years ago now

1016
01:03:10,322 --> 01:03:13,891
because like there are times
where I'm like,I cannot do this.

1017
01:03:14,577 --> 01:03:18,331
And in the back of my mind,like
this little,this little feeling

1018
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:21,481
comes ahead and it's like
structured yellow.And I'm like,

1019
01:03:21,811 --> 01:03:25,501
all right,I got this.You know,
like,it's just that bit of

1020
01:03:25,507 --> 01:03:30,452
confidence that I didn't have
because of the words that you

1021
01:03:30,456 --> 01:03:35,431
said years ago.Now to be able to
bring that into the things that

1022
01:03:35,431 --> 01:03:39,152
I'm doing,so sorry,

1023
01:03:39,157 --> 01:03:41,461
Nick: gonna make me,gonna make me
cry on the,on the live,sir.

1024
01:03:41,911 --> 01:03:44,552
Bekah: That's,that's all I want.
It really is for you to cry,

1025
01:03:45,391 --> 01:03:48,572
Nick: cry,cry and,and,and stitch
me up.That's,that's,that's the

1026
01:03:48,572 --> 01:03:49,532
criteria.Cry and stitch you

1027
01:03:49,532 --> 01:03:52,621
Bekah: up.That's what I'm here
for.You know?And also to be like,

1028
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:55,141
get back out there and do the
thing you're supposed to do.You

1029
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:57,782
Dan: know?Maybe not at the same
time the crying and the

1030
01:03:57,782 --> 01:04:01,501
stitching.Yeah.Yeah.You know,but
I feel like you don't want the

1031
01:04:01,507 --> 01:04:02,942
per person stitching you to be
crying

1032
01:04:02,942 --> 01:04:07,081
Nick: at the same time.Yeah.
Yeah.Exactly.Yeah.Oh,I'm

1033
01:04:07,081 --> 01:04:10,501
Bekah: so sorry.All,all of those
things have been incredibly

1034
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:16,217
important to me.in the last
couple of years.And I just wish

1035
01:04:16,222 --> 01:04:21,436
for everybody who listens out
there to realize that there is a

1036
01:04:21,436 --> 01:04:26,027
support system for you.There is
an opportunity for you.And

1037
01:04:26,027 --> 01:04:29,266
sometimes it's very hard and
sometimes you're gonna have to go

1038
01:04:29,271 --> 01:04:33,706
out of your comfort zone.And yes,
sometimes it doesn't make sense

1039
01:04:33,706 --> 01:04:38,186
at all,but you do the thing and
it provides returns that you

1040
01:04:38,192 --> 01:04:40,306
never,ever thought that you would

1041
01:04:40,306 --> 01:04:44,746
Nick: get.Yeah.And,and I just
wanna say like for you,like I,

1042
01:04:44,751 --> 01:04:48,317
I'm super happy that I've been
able to support you,but you also

1043
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:52,637
have to remember like,even though
I'm supporting you,it's,it's you

1044
01:04:52,637 --> 01:04:55,967
who did it in the end.You know
