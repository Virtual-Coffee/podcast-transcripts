Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello and
welcome to Season 6, Episode 7

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:06,695
of the

2
00:00:06,695 --> 00:00:12,111
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah, and this is a podcast that

3
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:16,221
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:19,041
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:21,951
coding journey. And they're
here, on this podcast, sharing

6
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:24,000
their stories and what they've
learned. And we are here to

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,670
share it with you. Here with me 
today is my co-host, Dan.

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,690
Dan Ott: Wuddup, Bek? How's
it going?

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,750
Bekah: It is- it is going well.
How's it going with you?

10
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:37,700
Dan: [Chuckles] It's going okay. 
Yeah, we have a great episode

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:37,926
today. We

11
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:41,286
met with Ryan Kahn, who has
done a lot of things through his

12
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:44,453
career. He was a teacher, he's a
developer, and now, Ryan is a

13
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:47,482
consultant who comes and helps
teams improve their collaboration

14
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:49,103
and their communication skills.

15
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:51,996
Bekah: I loved how Ryan talked
about the importance of

16
00:00:52,002 --> 00:00:57,741
empathizing with your teammates
and treating each person as an

17
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:01,762
individual human being who makes
up your team. I think that that's

18
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:06,352
a really great approach in order
to, you know, empower your team

19
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:10,792
to do what they can do and the
best ways that they can do it.

20
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:15,906
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. I- I
mean, it was- it was -- Ryan's

21
00:01:15,906 --> 00:01:19,477
-- I mean, Ryan's always great
to talk to, and, yeah. And that-

22
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:22,477
that, like, that- that
philosophy, I think, I don't

23
00:01:22,477 --> 00:01:24,576
know, lines up a lot with a lot
of the stuff we talk about here

24
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:27,277
at Virtual Coffee. So, it was
nice to hear him talk about it.

25
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:32,647
And it's nice that he is -- he's
doing this, like, he's -- I wa-

26
00:01:32,652 --> 00:01:35,917
I was very interested to hear
about his consultancy, and his-

27
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:38,000
and his, like, sort of new
journey that he is doing

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,337
because it's a little

28
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:42,427
bit of a different approach than,
you know, most people. I'm- I'm a

29
00:01:42,427 --> 00:01:46,177
consultant myself, but I just
kinda come in and I do, like,

30
00:01:46,177 --> 00:01:49,087
the work, right? Or like, you
know, the kind of stuff you- you

31
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:52,300
think about, right? And this is
more, Ryan's gonna come in and

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,046
help teams improve their whole
situation, right? And then leave

33
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:58,300
[chuckles], you know? And I
think that's really great. I

34
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,300
think it's a- I think it's a
very cool thing to do. And I was

35
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,197
excited to hear about it.

36
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,000
Bekah: Yeah. It is really
something that I think is

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,311
undervalued too.

37
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:10,252
So I think that a lot of teams
experience these problems and

38
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:14,800
they just end up having a lot of
turnover, or burnout, or things

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,201
like that.

39
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:19,912
And there's not a huge focus on
what Ryan's doing, but I think

40
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:22,671
it's something that should be
focused on. It's really needed in

41
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:23,301
the industry.

42
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:25,896
Dan: Yeah, I agree.

43
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:30,051
Bekah: Well, we start every
episode of the podcast like we

44
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:32,651
start every Virtual Coffee. We
introduce ourselves with our

45
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:35,532
name, where we're from, what we
do, and a random check-in

46
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:47,187
question. We hope you enjoy this
episode. Today's intro question

47
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:51,537
is, if you could remove one task
from your day, what would it be?

48
00:02:52,646 --> 00:02:55,826
My name is Bekah. I am a
technical community builder from

49
00:02:55,826 --> 00:03:01,300
a small town in Ohio, and if I
could remove one task I --

50
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,306
email, or -- no. Meetings. Can I
remove meetings? That's kind of

51
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:09,387
like general, but I would get
rid of most of them.

52
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:13,812
Dan: So, all meetings? All
right.

53
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:14,500
Bekah: Only the-

54
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,300
Dan: I'm used -- I mean [laughs]
--

55
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,852
Bekah: -only the ones I wanna
get rid of. The ones without

54
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:21,312
agendas. Those ones.

55
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:22,122
Dan: Sure.

56
00:03:22,197 --> 00:03:22,377
Ryan Kahn: Not this one, I hope.

57
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,766
Dan: Well, this isn't a meeting, 
this is- this is an event,

58
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:26,157
right?

59
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,981
Bekah: Mm-hmm. This is an event.

60
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:32,787
Dan: Yeah. Alright. Hi, I'm Dan.
I am in Cleveland. I do website

61
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:36,387
development. And, yeah, I think
-- the first thing that popped

62
00:03:36,387 --> 00:03:39,537
into my mind was like bedtime
stuff with the kids. I- I don't

63
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:42,236
mind like the all the way at the
end reading books and stuff, but

64
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:45,176
it's all the, you know, bath and
whatever, all that nonsense. But

65
00:03:45,176 --> 00:03:48,227
then, I think, actually, it's
getting them in the car.

66
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:49,056
Bekah: Oh.

67
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:51,500
Dan: There's -- I -- my, you
know, I still have a 3-year-old

68
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:51,806
and a 6-year-old,

68
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:54,986
and so they're still all,
both in car seats, you know, and

69
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:57,236
all that stuff. And doesn't
matter where we're going, what

70
00:03:57,236 --> 00:04:00,417
we're doing, it takes just for,
like, ever. Like, I sell them to

71
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,667
go outside cuz they can get into
the car by themselves, you know?

72
00:04:03,086 --> 00:04:04,856
And I tell 'em to go outside and
get in the car. And I go outside,

73
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:07,317
and they're just like wandering
around in the garage or whatever,

74
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:10,000
you know [laughs]? I'm like,
"Just- just get in the car. We

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,407
just need to go.

75
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:14,247
This is -- we don't have to do
this every time." And like, playing

76
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:16,107
with toys while I'm trying to get
them buckled and all this stuff.

77
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:18,500
So, that's gonna be my answer.
Yeah. Putting the kids-

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,776
Bekah: That's a good one.

78
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,627
Daan: -in the car. They could
just, like, snap [fingers snap],

79
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:21,956
and they would just be strapped
in the car. That would be --

80
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:24,357
Bekah: With their shoes on too,
right?

81
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:26,276
Dan: Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Exactly. Yeah.

82
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:28,916
Bekah: I don't know how many
times we've been in the car and

83
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:32,000
a kid doesn't have shoes. Like,
my kids are all ... older. My 

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,336
youngest is

84
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:36,836
five and a half, but frequently,
we end up in the car, and, like,

85
00:04:36,836 --> 00:04:40,300
one kid's like, "Oh, I did -- I 
didn't bring any shoes." Like,

86
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,500
"Why? What? How is that a
thing?" [Dan laughs]

86
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,857
Like, "You just always ..." "You
didn't tell me I needed to

87
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:46,586
put on shoes." "You always put on
shoes if you're getting in the

88
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,396
car." Like --

89
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:49,700
Ryan: Standard operating
procedure.

90
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,000
Bekah: Yeah.

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Dan: Yeah.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,312
Ryan: Okay. Well, I'm Ryan.

90
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:57,701
I am a developer experience
consultant and productivity

91
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:00,432
consultant in New York City. A
little- little town in New York

92
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:04,451
called New York City. My
daughter is little over one year

93
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:07,661
old. So getting her in the car is
very easy. We just pick her up,

94
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:09,762
and put her in, and she doesn't
have much of a choice about it.

95
00:05:09,762 --> 00:05:13,002
And if she needs shoes, we put
'em on. And, yeah, meetings.

96
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:15,221
I actually like meetings. I
think that that's when I do my

97
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:19,857
best work. So I won't say that.
I will say dishes. That is the

98
00:05:19,857 --> 00:05:22,700
one thing that my wife and I
[chuckles] have the most tension

99
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,206
about is actually just

99
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:27,297
doing the dishes. Cuz neither
one of us likes to do it. So

100
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:29,000
I would remove that from my day
in a heartbeat.

100
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,500
Dan: That's fine [??]. Yeah.

101
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,700
Ryan: Just, I mean, I would want 
clean dishes. I wouldn't wanna

102
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,507
just not do it and

102
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:35,666
have dirty dishes. But if the
dishes get clean regardless,

103
00:05:35,672 --> 00:05:37,706
that's what I would pick.
Yeah.

104
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:41,500
Dan: I like that. Yeah, I
actually, of all the, like, 

105
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,252
household chores that you

105
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:44,471
have to do all the time, dishes
are like one of the easiest ones

106
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:47,300
for me. Like, in which, you
know, I -- chores are like a

106
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,072
pain -- I don't mean easy.

107
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:51,492
Like, easy to get myself to do,
you know? I think I can

108
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:53,651
listen to podcasts and stuff, and
so it's, I don't know.

109
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:55,091
Ryan: Yeah. It's rather
meditative.

110
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,000
Dan: It doesn't bothers me when
I'm doing the dishes. Yeah,

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,601
exactly. Exactly [chuckles].
I'm, like, if

111
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:01,500
I'm doing that chore, then, you
know, that everybody -- somebody

112
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,372
else is dealing with the kids
[laughs].

113
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:05,831
Ryan: Hmm. A little break.

114
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:08,201
Dan: Oh, man. But I don't like
putting the dishes away,

115
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:09,252
honestly. That's my --

116
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:11,172
Ryan: Oh. Well, you know, it's
--

117
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,000
Dan: That's, like, I don't mind 
cleaning them. It's like putting

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,711
them away is the thing that
always bumps me on.

119
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:17,000
Ryan: Our dishwasher's actually
broken right now.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,300
Bekah: Yeah.

120
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,000
Ryan: So, all the dishes are
done by hand, which is probably

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,346
why it's front of mine, for me.

122
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:24,851
Bekah: Our dishwasher was broke
for like over a month. And it

123
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:29,442
was- it was the source of a lot
of tension in the house

124
00:06:29,442 --> 00:06:31,000
[laughs]. Like, we have four
kids and then some of them like

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,300
take plates in their rooms and
then you've got like crusty

126
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,242
dishes. Like, what are you
doing?

127
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:38,596
Ryan: And my wife does that.

128
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:44,141
Bekah: Well, Ryan, we are very
happy to have you here with us

129
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:47,982
today to talk about a lot of
different things. But building

130
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:50,951
better teams I think is gonna be
a great source of our

131
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:55,572
conversation. But before we get
to that, let's hear your origin

132
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:58,771
story. So, how did you get to
this point in your tech career?

133
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:02,007
Ryan: Yeah, thanks. I mean, I
always approach this story a

134
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:05,817
little differently every time I
tell it. I mean, I've always

135
00:07:05,817 --> 00:07:08,531
been interested in computers,
right when I was a kid. I

136
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:10,872
remember the first kind of
computer programming thing-

137
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:13,812
computer programming thing that I
did was, there was a video game I

138
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:17,112
liked to play and it was kind of
like Iron Man mode where like if

139
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:20,232
you die, you die. And I- I had a
big career in the game, and then

140
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,700
I died, and I was like, "Oh, my
god." I was so depressed.

141
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,000
Probably the first time I was
ever depressed in my life that I

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
remember was [chuckles] I dying
in this game.

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,700
And so, I came in, and I- I took
the save game file,

143
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,932
and I switched around the bits,
and made myself alive again.

144
00:07:33,742 --> 00:07:36,651
And so that's where I started
out. I think with the, you

145
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:39,052
know, I always was interested in
DOS, and kind of playing video

146
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:42,081
games. And so, I've been talking
to the computer for many years,

147
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:45,507
is what I call it, through the
terminal. But yeah, I never

148
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,057
considered it as a career, you
know? I had a teacher in high

149
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:51,987
school who got me into economics.
And so I decided to study

150
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:54,927
that in college. But, you know,
college didn't really agree with

151
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:58,286
me for mental health reasons. And
so I dropped out and I was

152
00:07:58,286 --> 00:08:01,317
working actually on a loading
dock. Cuz I had a- a CDL, like

153
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:04,137
a truck license, but I couldn't
find a job driving a truck. So I

154
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:06,627
got a job loading the trucks. It
was the middle of the- it was in

155
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:08,966
the middle of the night. It was,
you know, I learned a lot on that

156
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:12,776
job about hard work. But, you
know, it wasn't really what I

157
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:16,586
wanted to do long term. And a
friend of mine who I met in

158
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:19,000
college was like, "Hey, do you
wanna be a software engineer?"

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So, I mean, this is kind of the-
the height of privilege, right?

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's like someone just offers
you a job and you don't have to

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,300
apply. And, you know, like, I-
I- I feel for everybody these

162
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,000
days who is looking for a job as
a software engineer and really

163
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,716
kind of has

163
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:33,626
to look, and look, and look. You
know, for me it just fell in my

164
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:36,417
lap even when I wasn't looking
for it. So, a lot of privilege

165
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:40,136
there. And, yeah, so, you know,
I started off doing that job. It

166
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:43,346
was like a government contracting
job. I actually really enjoyed

167
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:46,466
it. I remember the first problem
I solved, which was putting a

168
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:49,300
ClickHandler on a button
[chuckles]. And, you know, I- I

169
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,300
solved it sort of the --

169
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,277
I put- put it in the HTML
as, like, text, which is, you know,

170
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:56,937
not how you even did it back then
with jQuery and stuff like that.

171
00:08:57,581 --> 00:09:01,991
This was back in 2009. And
yeah, so I didn't even solve it

172
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:04,331
kind of the right way, but the
elation of having solved a

173
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:07,241
problem was huge and I kind of
tried to stay close to that

174
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:10,032
feeling. Kind of like, you
know, with switching the bit in

175
00:09:10,037 --> 00:09:12,221
the save game file, just trying
to stay close to that feeling

176
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:18,581
throughout my career. And, so I
did that for about four years.

177
00:09:18,672 --> 00:09:21,011
You know, my boss was like, "I'm
not gonna pay you anymore than

178
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:22,991
you're making now." And I was
like, "Well, I could make more

179
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:24,700
money." So I went to another
job-

180
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

181
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,912
Ryan: -a private sector job, cuz

180
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:30,721
the first job was a government
contracting job. And, you know, I

181
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:34,111
enjoyed that too. You know, it's
-- it was in DC. It's not, like,

182
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:37,201
a big market. So the company
that I worked for was a little

183
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,000
bit, you know, janky, I would
say. Kinda like the first one.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,182
But I learned a lot at that job.
I worked with a lot of great

185
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:45,331
engineers, learned a lot
about what I didn't want in a

186
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:49,201
job. And at the same time, I-
I went to a meetup for General

187
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:52,062
Assembly, and they asked me,
"Hey." Someone just came up and

188
00:09:52,062 --> 00:09:53,772
said, "Hey, do you wanna be a
teacher?" And I immediately said,

189
00:09:53,772 --> 00:09:56,741
"Yes." It's something I hadn't
really thought about, but I was

190
00:09:56,741 --> 00:09:59,412
always on Stack Overflow, just
kind of answering questions and-

191
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,471
and so, it just was an immediate
yes for me. Like, I just kind of

192
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:05,501
-- it blurred outta my mouth, you
know? Like joy, without me even

193
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:09,971
thinking about it. And, yeah,
so I- I did some teaching at

194
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:12,912
General Assembly, and that was
sort of the end of my programming

195
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,522
career, even though it lasted for
another seven years or something.

196
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:18,971
Actually, I don't know how
long, but it lasted for a long

197
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:22,241
time after that, even though I
decide -- I decided at that point

198
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:25,572
that I wanted to solve human
problems in software, and not

199
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:28,121
so much solve the- the
programming problems. But I kept

200
00:10:28,302 --> 00:10:31,812
grinding at it for many years,
moved to New York, I

201
00:10:31,812 --> 00:10:36,027
continued to teach at a company
called Thankful. Just worked

202
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:39,177
at Squarespace first, and then
Dropbox, and then eventually

203
00:10:39,177 --> 00:10:42,746
just, you know, kind of burnt out
on development. Cuz again, I-

204
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:45,027
I kind of had already found
something in my calling a little

205
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:49,496
bit, in something else
related. And so now I work as a

206
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:52,557
consultant. And I guess we
can talk about that. But, yeah,

207
00:10:52,557 --> 00:10:56,486
it's, you know, what I'm trying
to do is help teams be more

208
00:10:56,486 --> 00:11:01,542
knowledgeable and more
productive, and deliver kind

209
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:04,272
of on a promise of quality, you
know, and- and-, and timelines.

210
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:06,822
So that's what I'm trying to
do as a consultant. But that was

211
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:10,481
sort of an evolution from
teaching. You know, from

212
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:13,902
teaching and- and solving human
problems. So that kind of brings

213
00:11:13,902 --> 00:11:15,881
me to where I'm at today. And
then, you know, of course I'm in

214
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:19,331
VC, which is a wonderful
community. And that's been a

215
00:11:19,331 --> 00:11:23,052
source of great joy for me.
And you'll make other communities

216
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:26,292
that I'm in, but this is kind of
the main one that I- I appreciate

217
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:28,032
the most. So yeah, that's kind of
where I'm at today.

218
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,996
Dan: We're the- we're the best
one, obviously. So --

219
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:36,000
Ryan: Well, the most welcoming,
right? [All laugh] The most

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,417
welcoming tech

220
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,996
community. I've started to get
the invite, so I'm really happy

221
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:41,697
about that. I hope we can
continue to expand at a- at a

222
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,000
measured rate-

223
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,300
Dan: Yeah.

224
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,596
Ryan: -with, you know, people
who are aligned with the vision.

224
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:49,902
Dan: Yeah. That's been so fun to
have new people back, you know,

225
00:11:50,052 --> 00:11:51,942
coming back in. It's been- it's
been fun.

226
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:51,700
Ryan: Yeah.

227
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,700
Dan: Well, Ryan, thank you for-

228
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,700
Ryan: Yeah, I'd like someone --
go ahead, go ahead.

229
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,000
Dan: -oh, go ahead. I was just
gonna say thank you for-

230
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,300
Ryan: I said --

231
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,000
Dan: -that story, but --

228
00:11:58,346 --> 00:12:00,687
Ryan: Yeah. Okay. Sure. Yeah.
Yeah. It's- it's- it's a

229
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,836
story that has other parts
to it, of course. It's hard to

230
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:07,167
kind of like capture a -- the
multidimensional nature of human

231
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:11,126
beings in a- in a short blurb.
But yeah, happy to talk more

232
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:12,297
about it as we go forward.

233
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:17,500
Bekah: Was there a moment in --
when you were teaching, that you

234
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,700
really felt, "This is what I
wanna be doing," or do you think

235
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,736
the whole experience just kind
of led you down this path?

236
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:28,812
Ryan: Well, there was a moment
when I was like, "This is not

237
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:31,731
what I wanna do," right in the
beginning. You know, I taught

238
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:34,822
HTM- I taught a front-end course
at General Assembly, and, you

239
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:37,000
know, I taught HTML and it was
great. I was like, "Oh, my god.

240
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,700
I'm such a good teacher, people
love me, I'm getting great

241
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,300
reviews. Like, this is what I
wanna do." And then we got into

242
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,700
JavaScript. And to be fair,
there was no curriculum, you

243
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,500
know what I mean? Like, this --
they just opened this office and

244
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
General Assembly was rather — I
don't know how young it was —

244
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,836
but it seemed pretty- pretty 
startup-y. And so, there was no

245
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:58,000
curriculum. So I had to make it
up as I went. And, you know, I

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,700
didn't do a good job at that,
initially. It's very tough to

247
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,500
teach JavaScript. And so-

248
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:02,700
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

249
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,500
Ryan: -[chuckles] I got all
these bad reviews.

248
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,126
People love me, still, cuz I'm
like a nice person, but they

249
00:13:08,126 --> 00:13:11,456
were like, "He's a nice person,
but he's not a good teacher." And

250
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:14,942
so that was sort of a lesson for
me. It's like, okay, prepare how

251
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:17,971
do you actually, you know, teach
really hard material to pe- to a

252
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:21,511
variety of people? So I learned
a lot from that. But, you know,

253
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:23,822
the initial kind of, you know,
I wouldn't say high, but the

254
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:28,351
initial sort of like, joy of
teaching was that first kind of

255
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:31,591
semester part of it, the first
half of the course. And I really

256
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:33,782
enjoyed that. And that kind of
carried me through even the tough

257
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:38,162
time of like, you know, not doing
well. But I also realized

258
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:40,442
from that, that I wanted to do
individualized mentorship more

259
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:43,976
than I wanted to do teaching in
general, you know? And I still

260
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:47,277
kind of struggle whether I wanna
do conference talks or -- cuz I

261
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:49,527
do like what I can do in
conversation rather than what I

262
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:52,976
do in kind of multiplexing, if
you will, to a bunch of people.

263
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:56,277
So yeah, I think teaching is
great. I do enjoy kind of getting

264
00:13:56,277 --> 00:13:58,797
up in front of people actually in
the- the kind of nervousness of

265
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,886
that. And -- but I do enjoy the
individualized mentorship better

266
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:04,300
and that's kind of where I- I
think I shine, is pair

267
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,256
programming and, you know,
conversations. So ... yeah.

268
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:13,647
Dan: Yeah. That's- that's really
cool. I was- I was -- well, I

269
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:16,287
think that's actually the
answer. But I was gonna ask, you

270
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:17,937
know, you talked -- when you
were talking about before you

271
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:21,567
were teaching, that feeling,
right? The feeling fixing the

272
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:22,700
game or-

273
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,000
Ryan: Yeah.

274
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Dan: -adding the ClickHandler,
right? You were talking about

273
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,116
staying close to that feeling,
which I -- which is, I-

274
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:30,956
I turn a phrase that I love and
also something that I've sort of

275
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,407
un- you know, unintentionally or
intentionally, sometimes, try to

276
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,167
do, throughout my career. But
my- my question was going to be

277
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,297
like, how do you stay close to
that feeling when you're not-

278
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:42,000
when you're not solving
technical computer problems

279
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
anymore, right? How --

279
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,422
like, what- like, what are ways
that you can -- that you do

280
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:48,761
stay close to that? Because I- I
imagine you do, but it's just a

281
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,591
little bit different. And so, I
was wondering if you talk a

282
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:54,192
little bit about like how you --
or if you've thought about

283
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:56,231
that at all [laughs]. How you
stay close to that feeling now?

284
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,000
Ryan: I have. I have. I think-

285
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,300
Dan: Yeah.

256
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,000
Ryan: -about it all the time
actually [laughs].

285
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,000
Dan: Yeah.

286
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:02,756
Ryan: Well, for me, it's the
concept, you know? There's a

287
00:15:02,756 --> 00:15:05,216
Buddhist teacher named Suzuki
Roshi who had a great phrase,

288
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:07,000
which is 'In the beginner's
mind, there are many

289
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,466
possibilities, and in

289
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:11,397
the experts mind, there are a
few.' And so I- I just

290
00:15:11,397 --> 00:15:14,711
remember the beginner's mind. I
try to remember that I don't

291
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:18,101
know, basically, anything. You
know what I mean? Like, you've had

292
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:21,552
experience with things, you've
seen some problems, but every

293
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:25,001
problem you solve is totally new.
It's, you know, it's like,

294
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:29,000
it's some new combination, some
new context, some new outcome

295
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,216
you're trying to achieve, some
new technologies. And so I try

296
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:35,606
to stay close to beginner's mind
as much as I can by reminding

297
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:40,317
myself that I don't know, and
going from that sort of area

298
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:44,096
of possibility rather than sort
of the preconceived notions. And

299
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:48,807
so in my current work, I try to
work with companies that want to

300
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:52,317
hire junior developers. I
think that's sort of the -- I'd

301
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:55,076
rather work with companies that
are trying to integrate juniors

302
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:57,716
rather than companies that are
obsessed with, you know,

303
00:15:57,716 --> 00:16:01,106
seniority. And the reason for
that is that helps me stay close

304
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:05,067
to beginner's mind by working
with beginners. You see the

305
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:08,652
kind of endless possibilities in
their mind. As they create

306
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:11,682
sort of quote, unquote bad code,
it's like -- that's actually

307
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:14,142
creative code. It's creative
problem solving. It's not like

308
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:16,841
they're just wrote -- writing
down something they already know.

309
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:19,751
They're really trying to solve a
problem from a standpoint of

310
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:24,116
possibilities. And so, yeah, I
think working with beginners is

311
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,096
how I stay close to that
feeling. In addition to kind of

312
00:16:26,096 --> 00:16:29,126
cultivating it in my own mind, I
try to experience it through the

313
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:32,907
minds of actual, you know- you
know, beginners. So yeah, I

314
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:35,547
think that's- that's kind of the
answer is, I- I try to stay close

315
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:38,397
to that feeling and then that
allows me that excitement when

316
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,976
other people solve problems.
When it clicks for other people.

317
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:44,366
That's where, like, it clicks for
me too, you know? It's like I- I

318
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:46,496
don't know that I could do it. I
mean, I, you know, if I'm solving

319
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:49,496
a problem myself, some sort of,
you know, big scope problem as

320
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:51,897
you get when you're more
experienced, there's clicks for,

321
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:54,596
you know, it clicks for me too.
And I get that- that feeling of

322
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,000
like, "Oh, it works," you know,
"There's no errors." Or, you

323
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
know, the TypeScript compiler
says, "Go ahead," you know?

324
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's- that's good stuff. But I
do love feeling it click or

325
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,987
seeing it click beginners, and
kind of experiencing that joy

326
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:07,356
secondhand.

327
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:13,451
Dan: That's awesome. That's very
cool. Like, being able to stay

328
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:15,791
close that feeling, right? By
sharing it with other people,

329
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:16,500
you know? I-

330
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,000
Ryan: Well, it's the best way
[unintelligible].

331
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,362
Dan: -before I ask this
question -- yeah, yeah. Totally.

330
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:22,001
Totally. You know, and you had-
you had started talking about --

331
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:26,300
on how you, like, doing more
one-on-one, you know, pairing

332
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:26,711
stuff like

332
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:29,261
that, with people, and I imagine
that's -- it becomes a lot

333
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:32,500
easier to do that, right? To-
to- to share in the experience

334
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:32,771
when you --

334
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:36,852
when it's a more intimate, you
know, learning situation, right?

335
00:17:36,912 --> 00:17:39,461
With one, you know, one-on-one
sort of thing, instead of, like,

336
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,000
teaching a class, for instance.

337
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,500
Ryan: It's true.

338
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,700
Dan: How it's easier to- easier
to close to that feeling

339
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,000
[chuckles].

337
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:45,717
Ryan: Also I've found that --
exactly. And also I've found

338
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:48,626
that -- I mean, this is an ADD
trait. But, like, if you tell me

339
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:50,757
to go off and do something, if
I'm not interested in it, I'm

340
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:54,386
not gonna do it [chuckles]. And
so, like, that's why freelancing

341
00:17:54,386 --> 00:17:54,481
[unintelligible] --

341
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:54,761
Dan: Hm. I dunno if I think
about that [all laugh].

342
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:58,700
Ryan: Well, yeah, exactly. So,
you know, it's- it's tough for

343
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,000
me to kind of do programming on
my own. And I've found that,

344
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
like, if someone else holds the 
focus, like in pair programming,

345
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,067
or if it -- if

345
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:10,616
it's something I can do in the
context of a meeting, you know?

346
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:13,977
Like, I just kind of go in, I do
the meeting, I come out, I go

347
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:17,096
back to my life. Like, that is
actually where I do my best work,

348
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,557
is something I can do in
conversation, in- in- in

349
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,886
collaboration. Where someone else
holds the focus, I can do the

350
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:25,856
best work. But, so that's sort of
another thing about knowing

351
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:30,146
myself, right? It's like knowing
where I work best and not trying

352
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:32,997
to, like, fit into someone
else's life as a- as a software

353
00:18:32,997 --> 00:18:36,200
developer, you know? So, and
also trying -- it took me a long

354
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,416
time to

354
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:40,656
kind of release myself from the
view I had of being a software

355
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:45,037
developer, cuz it was such a
part of my identity. And so

356
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:47,000
it's- it's tough, like, to say, 
like, you know, to give that up

357
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,616
to say, you

357
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:51,096
know, I don't wanna be a software
developer so much anymore, as

358
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,436
much as I wanna help other
software developers. Like,

359
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:57,000
that's a -- it was a mind
bending thing, you know? Cuz I

360
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,696
was so used to

360
00:18:57,696 --> 00:19:00,126
seeing, you know, to- to telling
people I was a software engineer.

361
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:03,277
I still do sometimes cuz it's
much easier than explaining what

362
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:05,436
I try to do, you know, if I don't
really wanna have the

363
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,916
conversation. If it's just some-
somebody doesn't know the

364
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,300
difference anyway. I'll just
say, "Oh, I'm a software

365
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,000
engineer." But it's still true.
I do a lot of engineering on my

366
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,300
own. But, yeah, pair
programming, things I can do in

367
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,916
conversation, is where I really
shine.

368
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:20,981
Bekah: So when you're working
with teams, how do you kind of

369
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:25,481
transfer that same energy to
teaching within a team, or what

370
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:28,662
do you think the role is and how
that's translated from your

371
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:30,031
experience to what you're doing
now?

372
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:33,146
Ryan: Well, I mean, first you
have to know the team, right? You

373
00:19:33,146 --> 00:19:35,186
have to kinda know what their
individual problems are. You have

374
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:38,126
to talk to them. And so, you
know, I- I start with like an

375
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:41,906
audit, where I go in and kind of
identify the pain points for

376
00:19:41,906 --> 00:19:45,000
people. So that way, when I go
pair with people, I know them.

377
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,281
And I

377
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:48,132
know the kind of what they're
working on. I know where they're

378
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:52,422
struggling. So yeah, I think
that, yeah, knowing- knowing

379
00:19:52,422 --> 00:19:54,701
people, knowing the people on the
team is kind of the most

380
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:57,221
important thing, and being
personal. You know, I don't --

381
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:59,700
I'm not writing a book, right 
[chuckles]? I'm not writing a

382
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,162
book on how to

382
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:02,501
solve all the problems. If I was
doing that, I mean, that would be

383
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:04,811
great too. But it's like I'm
really creating an

384
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:09,146
individualized plan for people
and companies as well, you know?

385
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:11,547
There's a plan for the team.
There's also a plan for

386
00:20:11,547 --> 00:20:15,176
individual pe- individual people
for how to improve, how to-

387
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:18,477
to do better. So, yeah. I
think I've actually forgot what

388
00:20:18,477 --> 00:20:21,086
the- what the feeling was you
were asking about, but I think

389
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:23,727
that's sort of maybe an answer. I
mean, if you- if you have a

390
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:26,636
follow up, I mean, maybe I can
get back on track. But that was

391
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:27,717
the first thing that came to
mind [laughs].

392
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:32,696
Bekah: Yeah. Well, I mean, it's a
hard balance transitioning from

393
00:20:32,696 --> 00:20:35,300
doing like one-on-one mentorship
and teaching-

394
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,500
Ryan: Oh, yeah.

395
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,497
Bekah: -to going inside of a

394
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:40,707
team. And I think that idea of
getting to know people is super

395
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:45,500
important because I- I think
that you can be way more

396
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:45,957
effective as

396
00:20:45,957 --> 00:20:50,156
a teacher if you do know the
people in front of you.

397
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:54,600
Because, like, I- I think. So
much of the time we

398
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:54,842
depersonalize what

398
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:58,711
we're doing or we abstract these
concepts out and try to apply

399
00:20:58,711 --> 00:21:01,800
them rather than, like,
recognizing, like, there's a

400
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,342
dynamic group of

400
00:21:02,342 --> 00:21:05,582
people in front of us and this
approach is not going to work

401
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:09,211
unless you have an understanding
of who those human beings are.

402
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:13,007
And I think that's, you know,
having those conversations and

403
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:15,900
the -- like, we do in Virtual
Coffee and the breakout rooms

404
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,186
makes a

404
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:20,267
big difference. And there- there
can be a real balance of like

405
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:25,727
trying to have that personal
experience, and having empathy,

406
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:30,287
and then also teaching in that
situation. So do you have any

407
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:33,136
strategies for being able to
balance those things?

408
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:37,317
Ryan: Well, you know, I- I think
there's -- I have sort of a view

409
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:39,000
on learning. I mean, I have a
lot of sound bites, right? That

410
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,436
I say over and over again. But,
you know, my view on learning is

411
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:46,932
that a knowledge is that -- it's
-- there's nobody has the same

412
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:50,382
knowledge. We all think that
like, "Oh, I learned React, you

413
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:53,500
know React, like, we know the
same thing," right? But

414
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,251
actually, you

414
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:57,402
know, the way we really learn is
by connecting to our experience.

415
00:21:57,761 --> 00:22:00,551
We have all these analogies that
are personal, that we use to kind

416
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:04,061
of identify and understand
problems, understand solutions,

417
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:07,301
understand technologies, and so
it's really like a 3D space where

418
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:09,852
nobody really overlaps. It's like
you have this sort of bubble of

419
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:14,000
knowledge in the- in the problem 
space. And it's very

420
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,471
multidimensional,

420
00:22:14,477 --> 00:22:16,932
it doesn't overlap with other
people, it's centered around you.

421
00:22:17,622 --> 00:22:19,692
And so I think when you're
working with a team, it's like,

422
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:22,662
you have to kinda understand that
a team is a collection of

423
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:26,531
individuals who have common
goals. It's not like a unit.

424
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:28,721
Like, you know, in the military
or something where everybody

425
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:31,031
just sort of like follows an o-
I mean, I don't know. I never

426
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:33,300
been in the military. But you
know, it's like that software

427
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,511
team is very much

427
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:37,632
like individual people tackling
problems individually. And I

428
00:22:37,632 --> 00:22:41,846
think that, the other thing is,
trying to break that cycle and

429
00:22:41,846 --> 00:22:44,517
improve kind of pairing and
knowledge sharing between the

430
00:22:44,517 --> 00:22:47,336
team. Because a lot of times, I
mean, the teams- these teams

431
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:50,817
I've been on, it's like you come
in, and people are individually

432
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:52,886
working on problems, your
individual productivity,

433
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:56,396
everybody's trying to burn down
their sprint points. And, you

434
00:22:56,402 --> 00:22:58,406
know, there's not like a lot of,
you know, some people will come

435
00:22:58,406 --> 00:23:00,267
up and ask a question
occasionally, but there's not,

436
00:23:00,957 --> 00:23:03,700
like, teams working together.
And so I think the- the ultimate 

437
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,300
thing is I don't

437
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,017
wanna be there in long term, you
know? I'm not there to, like,

438
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:09,807
be the teacher forever. My- my
goal is to change the team

439
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:13,047
dynamic to make everybody a
teacher, you know? Make

440
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:16,500
everybody sort of a learner. And
everybody a mentor, you know?

441
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,186
Not -- obviously,

441
00:23:17,186 --> 00:23:19,767
people have different capacities
and interests in it. But, you

442
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:22,166
know, just improving their
ability to do it in their own

443
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:25,346
way. I think is kind of -- I
think that answers your question.

444
00:23:25,346 --> 00:23:27,500
I always get off on these
tangents, but I think that's

445
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,500
sort of how I approach the team
dynamic, is really trying to

446
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,000
make myself irrelevant
[chuckles]. Make myself not

447
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,507
necessary in the long term.

447
00:23:36,777 --> 00:23:38,876
Cuz again, I wanna work in
limited engagements. It's again,

448
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:42,086
an ADD thing. I'm not trying
to make a year contract with

449
00:23:42,092 --> 00:23:45,086
somebody where I'm just, like,
constantly grinding with them.

450
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:48,300
It's like -- no, I wanna make
them better in a short term,

451
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,300
in an impactful way. Like you do
the- do the judo move where you

452
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,126
just sort of like come in and
flip things around and leave,

453
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:58,700
you know [chuckles]? That's kind
of my ultimate goal. Is not to-

454
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,846
not to be -- to make people

454
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:02,067
dependent on me, to make people
self-sufficient.

455
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:06,146
Bekah: I think that's great and
I think that one of the biggest

456
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:13,616
things that I see or hear in the
industry is it kind of takes a

457
00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:18,267
breaking point to bring somebody
in to rectify communication and

458
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:22,700
team ... I don't know what the
right word is.

459
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,500
Ryan: Dynamics? Or --

459
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,436
Bekah: What would you -- what
did you say?

460
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,700
Ryan: Effectiveness? A dynamics,
effectiveness --

461
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,000
Bekah: Yeah. Team effectiveness,
dynamics.

462
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,300
Ryan: Yeah. Proactivities
something.

463
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,537
Bekah: You know, people wait
until there's a problem. And

462
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:36,747
I feel like bringing someone in
very early on can reduce

463
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:43,436
miscommunications, burnout,
problems that you see because you

464
00:24:43,436 --> 00:24:46,616
haven't spent that time
developing communication. And I

465
00:24:46,616 --> 00:24:49,287
don't know if this is
particularly a startup issue, but

466
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,586
like, the whole move fast and
break things, I feel like there's

467
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:52,700
a lot-

468
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,000
Ryan: Oh, yeah.

469
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,000
Bekah: -lost in how we
communicate within teams and

470
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
cross team communication.

468
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,957
So, like, what- what is your
ideal situation to come in?

469
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:04,227
Would you like to come in from
the beginning? Or do you like

470
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:09,237
to come in and kind of like blow
people's minds by fixing their

471
00:25:09,237 --> 00:25:09,747
problem?

472
00:25:10,797 --> 00:25:13,136
Ryan: That's a good way to put
it. Yeah, I mean, a lot of the

473
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,076
things I offer are
counterintuitive, right? Like,

474
00:25:16,076 --> 00:25:18,500
slowing down, like, you know,
not going, moving fast, and

475
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,000
breaking things, but instead,
you know, allowing people the

476
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,300
time and the- the

476
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,757
ability to talk to each other,
first, you know? And second,

477
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:29,936
create quality. But I will
say that there's the ideal

478
00:25:29,936 --> 00:25:33,176
situation there is sort of a size
of the company that makes sense.

479
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:37,632
I think that one thing people
kind of discount is that the

480
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:41,201
best practices for a very small
company are different than the

481
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:44,172
best practices for a large
company, you know? If you're

482
00:25:44,172 --> 00:25:47,300
like a small company, and you're
trying to scale, you know, you

483
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:47,531
wanna get

483
00:25:47,531 --> 00:25:50,561
started first. You wanna create
an MVP, you wanna -- and so the

484
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:53,142
best practices for doing that
are not necessarily focused on

485
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:56,951
quality as much as they are
vetting and validating your

486
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:59,700
idea. And validating that it has
a market, and validating that

487
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,700
people want to use it. And that
maybe creates incentives that

488
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,337
are different. And

488
00:26:05,343 --> 00:26:07,797
if you're like a series a company
where you have maybe 10, 20

489
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:10,227
people, and you have some
investment, and you have some

490
00:26:10,227 --> 00:26:13,977
ability to take risks to improve
quality, right? So, I think, the

491
00:26:13,981 --> 00:26:17,247
ideal situation is a little
larger company — also larger

492
00:26:17,251 --> 00:26:20,126
companies — have the ability to
onboard juniors more. I think

493
00:26:20,126 --> 00:26:22,856
that, you know, it -- it's tough
when you're a small company to

494
00:26:22,856 --> 00:26:26,426
have maybe one developer who,
you know, is a junior developer.

495
00:26:26,426 --> 00:26:28,886
I think it's probably great from
a standpoint to that junior

496
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:30,987
developer, they learned so much.
I've been in that situation where

497
00:26:30,987 --> 00:26:33,537
I'm the only front-end developer
or something, and I was kind of

498
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:36,416
junior. And I learned a lot, you
know? So, I think, it's great for

499
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,057
the person. But for the company,
maybe it's like they wanna move

500
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:41,700
faster. They wanna- they wanna
break things, but, like, they

501
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,116
don't wanna things to be broken
constantly. So yeah, you

502
00:26:45,116 --> 00:26:47,517
know, I think that the best
practices are different. And the

503
00:26:47,517 --> 00:26:50,457
ideal situation is maybe a
slightly larger company where

504
00:26:50,457 --> 00:26:53,071
there is a team. The team is sort
of established. There's

505
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:56,342
investment and ability to take
risks. I would love to work

506
00:26:56,342 --> 00:26:58,561
with, you know, smaller companies
and work from the beginning,

507
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:01,922
right? But that also is maybe
they may- maybe a little more

508
00:27:01,926 --> 00:27:04,561
dependent on me, right? They
actually may wanna hire me as

509
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:06,000
like a senior developer, and
that's not really what I'm

510
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,300
trying to do. I wanna come in,
and, like, have a team that I

511
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,291
can work with,

511
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:14,221
and kind of affect, especially a
junior team. So yeah, I think

512
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:16,172
that I would love to be there
from the beginning and help them

513
00:27:16,172 --> 00:27:18,541
build quality, but I'd rather be
there when they are ready to

514
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:19,000
build quality.

515
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,300
Bekah: Hm.

516
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,906
Ryan: Ready to- to have those
counterintuitive solutions.

515
00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:27,116
Like, "Hey," you know, "Slow
down. Don't -- when there's a-

516
00:27:27,116 --> 00:27:29,500
when there's tech debt, solve it
right away. Have everybody work

517
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:29,906
on it," you know?

517
00:27:29,906 --> 00:27:32,606
Things like this, which are sort
of like, not the

518
00:27:32,606 --> 00:27:35,217
incentives you usually have. You
know, cuz the main thing is

519
00:27:35,217 --> 00:27:36,797
they've been trying things. Like
you said, there's a problem,

520
00:27:36,797 --> 00:27:40,300
right? Their -- the CTO is
talking to the CEO, and the CEO

521
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,700
is like, "Hey, you're not
delivering on these business

522
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,500
needs. Your team is making a- a
qual- a qua- product that lacks

523
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,000
in quality, and our users
noticed." And, you know,

523
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,567
what's the problem that you're
-- you can't af- affect these

524
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:54,537
things. That's kind of the- the
issue that I would come in and

525
00:27:54,537 --> 00:27:57,987
sort of solve, is like when that
exists -- and I think it exists

526
00:27:57,987 --> 00:28:01,076
in a lot of teams at different
times. But yeah, that's what

527
00:28:01,076 --> 00:28:04,047
I would say. It's like there is
an ideal size and an ideal

528
00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:07,000
problem to come in and solve,
and- and not -- companies are

529
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,376
not really

529
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:10,257
ready for counterintuitive
solutions when they're --

530
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:12,500
everything's working fine
[chuckles]. I think they don't

531
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
wanna come in and,

531
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,936
like, change things. They're
like, "Oh, everything's working

532
00:28:14,936 --> 00:28:17,300
fine." But when there's a
problem, it's like, "Try

533
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,500
something different. Try a
different tact. Because that's

534
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,896
how you're gonna find a
solution."

535
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:26,300
Dan: I -- you know, we talked --
Ryan had me on his Twitter

536
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,848
space ... what was that? Last
week? This week? I dunno. Time

00:28:29,848 --> 00:28:31,300
has no meaning anymore.

537
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,439
Ryan: In the past.

538
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,644
Dan: Recently? [All laugh] And-

539
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,000
Ryan: Not- not in the future.
In the past.

540
00:28:34,723 --> 00:28:37,500
Dan: One- one of the things we 
talked about wa- a lot was- was

541
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,000
the idea of technical debt on
teams, right? And- and that's

542
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,500
like one of the-

542
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,749
one of the -- maybe one of
the problems that you are hoping

543
00:28:45,749 --> 00:28:47,700
to be able to help solve, right,
with- with these teams.

544
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,000
Ryan: Yeah.

544
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,000
Dan: Could you talk a little bit
about what- what technical debt

545
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,719
is? You know, like,

545
00:28:51,723 --> 00:28:54,000
what- what it means to you when
somebody says technical debt?

546
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,700
And what -- and then- and then
also, like, you know, how- how

547
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,489
that can, like, negatively
affect a team, you know? Maybe

548
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:03,838
even without them knowing about
it.

549
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:06,088
Ryan: Well, I think there's
actually -- it's important to

550
00:29:06,088 --> 00:29:08,818
say there's actually lots of
different kinds of debt. They

551
00:29:08,818 --> 00:29:11,009
are different than just -- I
mean, a lot of people when- when

552
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:13,000
they say technical debt, they
think of some developer

553
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,300
experience problem where

553
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,500
it's like there's something
counterintuitive-

554
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:15,700
Dan: Mm-hmm.

554
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,700
Ryan: in the code, some feature
-- but you know -- excuse me.

555
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,969
There's actually multiple

555
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:24,808
different kinds of debt. There's
quality debt, which is where

556
00:29:24,808 --> 00:29:27,959
you're building things kind of
let -- lack quality, and you

557
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:30,838
just leave it that way. I did
this funny tweet where I had a

558
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:32,800
bridge that I built in like Poly 
Bridge — I dunno if you know

559
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,328
this game —

559
00:29:33,598 --> 00:29:35,669
but it has these gaps in the
bridge, and like, the truck goes

560
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:38,009
across it, and the bridge flexes
around, and I'm like, this is

561
00:29:38,013 --> 00:29:40,500
kind of how we built products.
We leave these gaps and we say,

562
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,300
"Oh, the bri- the truck can get
across the bridge without the-

563
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:43,558
the whole

563
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:47,249
thing being built, therefore it's
done." And so I think, that's

564
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:50,429
sort of a quality problem, right?
So that's quality debt. There's

565
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:53,300
knowledge debt, which is where
the- the- the product doesn't

566
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,939
teach people how to use it, how
to develop on it rather. And I

567
00:29:56,939 --> 00:29:59,699
think that the ultimate sort of
product is one that teaches the

568
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:03,700
developers how to- how to- how
to create, you know, changes in

569
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,138
it, right? How

569
00:30:04,138 --> 00:30:07,558
to extend it, how to modify it to
maintain it. If the product isn't

570
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:10,229
teaching people that, that's
knowledge debt, right? That's

571
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:12,300
sort of -- and the team isn't
sharing the knowledge too,

572
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,669
right? But -- so it's kind of a
combination of sort of like

573
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:18,388
automated solutions and just
plain old interfacing with other

574
00:30:18,388 --> 00:30:22,450
people face to face, or- or you
know, remotely. Or even 

575
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:22,558
asynchronously,

575
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:24,419
right? Cuz there's lots of
different ways teams operate

576
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:27,479
these days. So, that's knowledge
debt. There's tactical debt,

577
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:29,398
which is, well, you know, we
talked about, sort of like

578
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:34,318
developer facing problems in the
code that make it hard to

579
00:30:34,318 --> 00:30:36,500
develop, that make it hard to 
implement quality, and hard to 

580
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,199
share knowledge.

580
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:41,009
And then there's- there's one
other one that I- I can't think

581
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:44,000
of right now [laughs]. But yeah,
it's -- there's -- that's what I

582
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,308
would say.

582
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:47,294
There's lot -- there's other
different kinds of debt.

583
00:30:47,354 --> 00:30:49,574
Quality debt, knowledge debt,
technic- well, you know,

584
00:30:49,574 --> 00:30:52,243
I'll think of it. It's just
funny. I should know it cuz it's

585
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:54,223
kind of something -- I dunno if
it's something I came up with,

586
00:30:54,223 --> 00:30:57,163
but it's something I talk about a
lot. But there's different kinds

587
00:30:57,163 --> 00:31:01,064
of -- oh, innovation debt.
That's it. So innovation debt is

588
00:31:01,064 --> 00:31:05,219
like, is things you wanna do
but you haven't done, cuz you

589
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:08,128
can't do it for some reason, you
know? Like, you wanna build this

590
00:31:08,128 --> 00:31:11,009
feature, you wanna implement
this big change, refactor the

591
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:13,000
product, but everything else is 
holding you back, right? So,

592
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,469
that's sort

592
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:16,739
of like there's a debt in the-
in the innovation you're trying

593
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:19,200
to do. So yeah, I think breaking
it down in different -- into

594
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,439
different

594
00:31:19,443 --> 00:31:22,500
kinds of debt, not just focusing
on calling it technical debt,

595
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,500
sort of like opens you up to
really affect the problems that

596
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,074
are holding you

596
00:31:26,074 --> 00:31:28,894
back, to affect the things that
are preventing you from

597
00:31:28,894 --> 00:31:31,700
delivering on that qua- promise,
like I said, and quality, right?

598
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,413
And promise of timelines ...
you know?

599
00:31:35,219 --> 00:31:37,500
Bekah: Yeah, I love how you
break that down. I think that

600
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:37,919
that really

600
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,558
helps to better understand what-
what problems that you're facing,

601
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:47,338
and also to be able to
explain it to other people.

602
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:51,989
Especially if you have junior
members who are- are just coming

603
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,929
into the industry and trying to
understand exactly what you mean

604
00:31:54,929 --> 00:32:00,449
by technical debt. I think it
also can help people to better

605
00:32:00,449 --> 00:32:05,578
identify their problems by
looking at it in that way. So

606
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:09,209
I- I think that this kind of
touches on this idea of knowledge

607
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:13,858
sharing and how you do that in
teams. So, can you first

608
00:32:13,858 --> 00:32:17,878
define knowledge sharing for us?
And then maybe talk about where

609
00:32:17,878 --> 00:32:19,328
to start with that?

610
00:32:20,588 --> 00:32:23,469
Ryan: Yeah, I mean, I think it's,
you know, we have this

611
00:32:23,469 --> 00:32:26,100
problem of droughts these days, 
right? Because of, you know,

612
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,338
global

612
00:32:26,338 --> 00:32:29,159
warming. And there's places that
have water, there's places that

613
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:31,259
don't have water. And how do you
irrigate, you know? How do you

614
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:33,838
get water from one place to
another so that everybody can

615
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:37,229
drink, everybody can grow crops,
right? And that's sort of what I

616
00:32:37,229 --> 00:32:40,169
see knowledge sharing as it is.
There's people that have the

617
00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:43,679
context, have the understanding,
and there's people that need that

618
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,068
understanding, that need that
context to affect their work. And

619
00:32:47,068 --> 00:32:49,118
it's like, how do you get the
water from one place to another,

620
00:32:49,118 --> 00:32:52,854
you know? And, there's lots of
different ways to do it, right?

621
00:32:52,913 --> 00:32:55,104
There's, you know, documentation
-- cuz the thing is, there's

622
00:32:55,134 --> 00:32:57,354
asynchronous and synchronous
knowledge sharing, right?

623
00:32:57,864 --> 00:32:59,903
Synchronous knowledge sharing is
what we're doing right now. We're

624
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:03,624
having a conversation in real
time. I'm telling you -- you're

625
00:33:03,624 --> 00:33:07,513
asking me questions, I'm telling
you something logical. I

626
00:33:07,513 --> 00:33:09,403
wouldn't call it an answer,
right? Cuz there's lots of

627
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:11,804
different answers. But I'm
telling you personal answers

628
00:33:11,804 --> 00:33:14,443
about like how I think about
problems. So that's like

629
00:33:14,443 --> 00:33:16,663
synchronous knowledge sharing.
And I think that if you can do

630
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:19,844
that, that's kind of the best way
to do it. Yes, it costs two

631
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:23,203
people's time. Which is kind
of where people get caught up is

632
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:25,500
like, "Oh, there's a big cost,"
you know, like pairing. There's

633
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:25,663
a big

633
00:33:25,663 --> 00:33:31,453
cost with meetings, you know,
or one-on-ones ideally. But you

634
00:33:31,453 --> 00:33:33,794
know, of course there's a cost,
but it's like there's a huge

635
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:36,854
benefit. It's not like two times
-- two people is two times work,

636
00:33:36,854 --> 00:33:40,000
you know? And two times cost.
It's like, maybe it's two times

637
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,523
cost, but it's like there's a
multiplication effect that

638
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:44,953
happens when people share
knowledge, both in terms of the

639
00:33:44,953 --> 00:33:47,983
our ability to execute, and also
their ability to build quality,

640
00:33:47,983 --> 00:33:50,653
right? Cuz they know the edge
cases. They know sort of the

641
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:54,614
context they need to create best
practices within the product. And

642
00:33:54,614 --> 00:33:56,413
then there's asynchronous
knowledge sharing, which is

643
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,500
around, like, it could be Slack, 
right? It could just be that's

644
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,213
async sort of knowledge sharing.
There's also documentation,

645
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:05,394
right? I have a lot of ideas on
documentation and kind of how to

646
00:34:05,394 --> 00:34:09,503
affect it and make it sort of
useful for people. But yeah,

647
00:34:09,503 --> 00:34:11,184
that's what I would say. That's
sort of knowledge sharing in a

648
00:34:11,184 --> 00:34:14,244
nutshell. It's like how do you
irrigate this knowledge between

649
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,514
different areas? The people that
have it, the people that need it,

650
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,603
and doing it synchronously
and asynchronously, and sort of

651
00:34:20,603 --> 00:34:22,914
like being aware of the
difference between the two.

652
00:34:22,914 --> 00:34:24,128
I don't know if it's make
sense.

652
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,619
Dan: I love that metaphor. No, it
makes- it makes a ton of sense.

653
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:27,668
I, you know, I just --

654
00:34:28,298 --> 00:34:29,700
Ryan: I have a lot of
water-based metaphors for

655
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,759
programming. So --

655
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:33,429
Dan: Water-based metaphors.
Alright. I like it. I'm- I'm a

656
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:35,648
big fan of- I'm a big fan of- of
[unintelligible].

657
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:36,969
Bekah: Would you be a Water
Bender?

658
00:34:37,688 --> 00:34:39,969
Ryan: No, I would be Bruce Lee.
Like, you know, if you put water

659
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:42,398
in a cup, it becomes the cup. You
put water in a bottle, it becomes

660
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,128
the bottle. That's sort of my
thinking of water is that it's

661
00:34:45,128 --> 00:34:49,100
like, it's flexible and I like-
I like that idea. It's a

662
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,300
flexible-

663
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:49,500
Dan: So --

664
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,000
Ryan: -metaphor.

662
00:34:51,443 --> 00:34:53,700
Dan: Nevermind. I was just
[laughs] -- I was gonna take

663
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,744
this metaphor too far.

663
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:57,998
Ryan: No, well, you know, I
mean, it's great metaphor, so --

664
00:34:58,043 --> 00:34:59,903
Dan: Oh, I was trying to figure
out what- what, like, Twitter

665
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:03,000
would be if you're, you know,
sharing if knowledge is- is

666
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
[unintelligible], like --

666
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:04,869
Ryan: Twitter is a rainstorm
[Bekah laughs].

667
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:08,700
Dan: It is a rainstorm or is
like you -- like your Twitter 

668
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:08,844
account —

668
00:35:08,844 --> 00:35:10,884
not you — but like a person's
Twitter account is like you

669
00:35:10,884 --> 00:35:12,773
standing there with a scorecard
[laughs], right?

670
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:14,469
Ryan: Exactly. You're just --
it's a fire hose. You're just-

671
00:35:14,498 --> 00:35:15,248
Dan: Right [laughs].

672
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:16,418
Ryan: -blast in into a- into a
chasm [laughs].

673
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:19,659
Dan: Right. Right. Yeah. Maybe
it hits the people.

674
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:21,893
Ryan: And sometimes it splashes
back at you. But that's, you

675
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:22,074
know-

676
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:22,389
Dan: Right?

677
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,563
Ryan: -that's about it. I don't
know. That's a good question.

678
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,000
Dan: I- I like -- no, I mean,
but- but going back to like

679
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
what- [chuckles] what you were 
saying before, the- the -- that

680
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,998
metaphor of the -- especially

680
00:35:31,148 --> 00:35:33,789
the -- you started this with
the concept of droughts,

681
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:37,869
right? And- and, I think -- I
feel like that is a really

682
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,800
powerful part of this metaphor
is, you know, you have these 

683
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,300
droughts, right?

683
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,384
And o-of knowledge and- and the
-- yeah, yeah. And the- the lake

684
00:35:45,384 --> 00:35:47,784
of knowledge, like, you have the
lake of knowledge sounds -- this

685
00:35:47,784 --> 00:35:49,000
is [unintelligible].

685
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:49,000
Ryan: Yeah. With the drought,
nothing grows, you know what I

686
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,898
mean? Nothing is built.

686
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:51,000
Dan: Right, right, right.

687
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,000
Ryan: Nothing is active.

688
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,014
Dan: Yeah. And --

687
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,318
Ryan: People are so, you know-

688
00:35:53,813 --> 00:35:54,173
Dan: I- I guess --

689
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:54,849
Ryan: -thirsty [chuckles].

690
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,773
Dan: Yes. I think that's a great
way of thinking about it.

691
00:35:57,773 --> 00:35:59,000
It's -- it can -- pretty
awesome metaphor.

692
00:35:58,268 --> 00:36:01,300
Ryan: Kim Kardashian is like
mow- watering her lawn at

693
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,300
200,000 gallons, you know? It's
like, no- nobody else has the

694
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:04,789
water. I don't know.

695
00:36:05,768 --> 00:36:08,978
Dan: Right. So that means she's
the senior developer who doesn't

696
00:36:08,978 --> 00:36:09,849
talk to anybody and then --

697
00:36:09,898 --> 00:36:12,188
Ryan: Exactly. I mean, there are 
those people right there try to

698
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:13,028
forge power, right?

698
00:36:13,028 --> 00:36:14,289
Dan: Absolutely. You know, a-and
--

699
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:15,489
Ryan: Try to [unintelligible]
dragons, [unintelligible].

700
00:36:15,818 --> 00:36:19,000
Dan: And talked about -- dragons
[laughs]. Yeah, we- we- we

701
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,548
talked about -- or you

701
00:36:21,548 --> 00:36:25,059
talked about, you know, it --
some of this work being easier

702
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,728
with larger teams or whatever,
things like that. I feel like

703
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:30,700
this happens a lot more often
with smaller teams. May-maybe

704
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,000
not more often,

704
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,518
but it is a harder solve --
problem to solve, right, with a

705
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:38,498
smaller team. Especially, like,
long-term. So, I'm just talking

706
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:39,500
about myself here [laughs]. So-

707
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,000
Ryan: No, go ahead.

708
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,528
Dan: -just like talk about --
but like, I've been working on-

709
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,300
Ryan: I'm very interested in it.

707
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,949
Dan: -some of these- some of
these products for, like, your

708
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:50,034
-- like ... I dunno. I've been
working on one client for over 

709
00:36:50,034 --> 00:36:54,000
10 years, right? And I have a
ton of knowledge just in my head

710
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,454
about it. And, you know, I try
to do docs and stuff, but it's

711
00:36:56,454 --> 00:36:59,213
like small team, right? So that 
means, mostly me, you know? And

712
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:02,300
then, sometimes, like Bekah
worked with me for a while, and-

713
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:02,543
and- and I

713
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:05,724
have somebody else working with
me now, you know? And it's --

714
00:37:06,713 --> 00:37:09,200
-there's all these -- there's
all -- there's like deserts,

715
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,414
right? Of-

715
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:12,653
of- of not knowledge, right?
I, you know, there's places

716
00:37:12,653 --> 00:37:14,813
where I've like, "This is gonna
be confusing, so I'm gonna, like,

717
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:17,123
write things down." But there's
other places where, you know,

718
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:19,974
either — well, for a million
different reasons — there's, you

719
00:37:19,978 --> 00:37:23,873
know, nothing, right? And I
guess I don't really have a point

720
00:37:23,873 --> 00:37:26,273
other than it's hard- it's hard
problem. It can be a very hard

721
00:37:26,273 --> 00:37:27,923
problem to solve for teams of
all sizes.

722
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:31,300
Ryan: Yeah. Well, you know, what
I would say, again,

723
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:31,418
counterintuitive

723
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:35,949
solutions, right? My way of
keeping -- my way of saying keep

724
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:39,300
docs up-to-date is don't try
[chuckles], you know? Speaking

725
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,000
of the water metaphor, it's a
point in time thing.

726
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,200
Dan: Talk --

726
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,398
Ryan: There's -- well, go ahead.
What were you gonna say?

727
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,500
Dan: Talk more -- no, I was
gonna say, talk more about this

728
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:44,829
[chuckles]. That- that

728
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:46,400
is -- I never heard somebody say
that before, so I wanna hear

729
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:46,824
what you say.

729
00:37:46,824 --> 00:37:49,284
Ryan: Well, I think there's some
documentation that needs to be

730
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:52,373
sort of evergreen, right? Like
onboarding documentation. It sort

731
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:55,100
of needs to be evergreen.
READMEs need to be evergreen.

732
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,500
But I think architectural
documentation, with, like,

733
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,673
diagrams, and like, how

733
00:37:58,673 --> 00:38:02,514
things work, I think it's- it's
so tough to kind of keep that up

734
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:05,603
to date because it's such a big
sort of problem, you know? Like,

735
00:38:05,603 --> 00:38:07,974
how does the whole thing work?
It's different from onboarding,

736
00:38:07,974 --> 00:38:10,463
which is like, how do you start
the thing you don't know. But-

00:38:10,463 --> 00:38:11,000
Dan: Totally.

737
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,114
Ryan: -architectural doc- go
ahead.

738
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:14,469
Dan: Oh, I was just saying
totally. I was just agreeing

739
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:15,200
with you. I'm sorry [chuckles].

739
00:38:14,664 --> 00:38:17,000
Ryan: Oh yeah, exactly.
Documenta- or, you know,

740
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,244
architectural

740
00:38:17,244 --> 00:38:20,000
documentation is so tough to
kind of like take the whole

740
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,668
product and

741
00:38:20,668 --> 00:38:24,114
put it -- boil it down into a
little residue of knowledge. And

742
00:38:24,114 --> 00:38:26,483
so I think, you know, I really
like the idea of architectural

743
00:38:26,483 --> 00:38:30,143
decision records, which is I see
it like a blog, you know? You're

744
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:32,364
keeping a blog of like all the
changes you're making in the

745
00:38:32,364 --> 00:38:35,333
product, and it's point in time,
and you don't update it. It's just

746
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:38,000
like, this is the decision we
made. And then if you- you --

747
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,333
and I

747
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:40,614
think if you reference those in
the code, right? And, you know,

748
00:38:40,614 --> 00:38:43,523
you have some anchor comments or
something that like link to these

749
00:38:43,523 --> 00:38:46,583
different architectural records.
And, you know, the architectural

750
00:38:46,588 --> 00:38:50,434
records supersede each other,
they amend each other, they have

751
00:38:50,438 --> 00:38:52,623
linkages, sort of like hyper
text, right? It's like they're

752
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:55,474
all linked together. So it is
very much like a blog that you're

753
00:38:55,474 --> 00:38:57,903
keeping of the decisions you make
throughout the development of the

754
00:38:57,903 --> 00:39:01,023
product. And you're not trying to
like go in and create sort of an

755
00:39:01,023 --> 00:39:05,074
omnibus like book that's
constantly has new additions.

756
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:08,313
You're creating blog posts that
sort of like, you know, do the

757
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:11,804
point in time thing. And that's
much easier to kind of approach,

758
00:39:11,804 --> 00:39:14,233
especially as a small team.
Because you don't -- you're not,

759
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:16,664
like, constantly going back and
trying to create evergreen, you

760
00:39:16,664 --> 00:39:19,184
know, an evergreen documentation.
You're just writing these blog

761
00:39:19,184 --> 00:39:22,304
posts and leaving it, you know,
as you go, as little breadcrumbs

762
00:39:22,304 --> 00:39:25,094
for someone to say, "Oh, this is
how the product evolved." Also,

763
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:29,153
you have sort of knowledge about
how the product used to be. Which

764
00:39:29,153 --> 00:39:31,224
I think is also very important
because sometimes you wanna go

765
00:39:31,224 --> 00:39:34,373
back, you know? Sometimes you
wanna learn from the past, you

766
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:37,193
wanna learn from like how things
were done initially. And also

767
00:39:37,193 --> 00:39:40,193
it's just like, it explains
things in a way that maybe

768
00:39:40,224 --> 00:39:43,643
just a present sort of evergreen
documentation wouldn't. Cuz you

769
00:39:43,643 --> 00:39:46,373
say like, "Oh, this is why that
was done." There's so many times

770
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:48,000
when we go into a codebase and
go, "Oh my God, this is

771
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,500
horrible. I was just done this
way." And the truth is always a

772
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,398
reason. There's

772
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:54,199
always a reason. I- I always try
to tell people that when they're

773
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:57,048
like, "Oh, I got this legacy
codebase, and it's like, it's

774
00:39:57,048 --> 00:39:59,800
the worst. Like, I can't believe
it. Who are these bad

775
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,048
developers?"

775
00:40:00,048 --> 00:40:02,539
It's like, you know, they were
you. Just in the past, working

776
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:05,000
with problem, you know? They're
not, like, bad developers. It's

777
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,418
just they're

777
00:40:05,418 --> 00:40:07,878
working on deadlines, they're
working on the context is

778
00:40:07,878 --> 00:40:10,639
different. And so, like, I think
knowing that having empathy for

779
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:13,938
those original sort of the
ancestors of the codebase is

780
00:40:13,938 --> 00:40:16,954
sort of like important. And just
that's kind of something you get

781
00:40:16,954 --> 00:40:20,014
from a decision record that you
wouldn't get from, you know, like

782
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,000
explanation of what -- how
things are. And also it kind of

783
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,300
-- it- it

783
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,793
shows sort of alternate solutions
that you might consider in the

784
00:40:26,793 --> 00:40:29,344
future — the decision record. If
you- if you look at the- the-

785
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,000
the kind- you know, the way
they're written, it sometimes

786
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,554
talks about

786
00:40:32,554 --> 00:40:34,833
alternate paths that could have
been taken in the decision that

787
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:37,143
was made, and that could be
useful in the future. You might

788
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,974
say, "Oh, you know, that's
actually a way we could go with

789
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:42,100
this, based on the current
context. Let's go refactor

790
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,588
that." And

790
00:40:42,588 --> 00:40:46,128
it's also in the code. There's
context, you know? It's like --

791
00:40:46,188 --> 00:40:49,278
and I think documentation and
code is really the way to go,

792
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:52,309
for all things. Cuz I think it's
like when you separate it from

793
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:55,789
the code, you lose the context
of ... you lose context. And I

794
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:58,548
think that's important to
understanding how things work.

795
00:40:58,548 --> 00:41:01,000
But yeah, that's kind of my
thinking. Again,

796
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,219
counterintuitive

796
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:03,708
solutions, it's like try
something different. There's a

797
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:05,898
thing called, like, Oblique
Strategies, where it's like-

798
00:41:05,898 --> 00:41:08,568
it's like you just have a card,
you pull it out, and it says,

799
00:41:08,568 --> 00:41:09,188
like, you know,

799
00:41:09,188 --> 00:41:12,300
"Dance around in a circle," and
like, that's how you, like,

800
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:12,429
cultivate

800
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:15,639
your creativity. I think like
thinking differently and trying

801
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,338
different things than you would
normally do or are normally done

802
00:41:18,338 --> 00:41:20,700
in the industry is sort of an --
if -- even if it doesn't work,

803
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,248
it tells

803
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:23,438
you something about how it might
work, you know? It's an

804
00:41:23,438 --> 00:41:26,438
experiment that you're testing
hypothesis and maybe it doesn't

805
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:29,228
work, but like, you learn
something new in the process. So-

806
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:30,700
so -- there was a dog.

807
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,000
Dan: Oh, man.

808
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,228
Ryan: Yeah, that's what I-
that's what I think. Yeah.

807
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:36,600
Dan: I love that. I -- this
architectural deci- decision

808
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,000
records ... I was just looking
it up.

809
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,500
Ryan: Yeah, yeah.

808
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,700
Dan: I found a couple -- I kind
of found a couple blog posts

809
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,000
[unintelligible].

810
00:41:41,978 --> 00:41:43,989
Ryan: It's like, adr.github.io.
A-D-R --

811
00:41:44,228 --> 00:41:46,298
Dan: That's what I -- yeah.
That's- that's what I'm on right

812
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:49,509
now. And I- I like that concept
a lot. I like to, you know, it's

813
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:52,000
-- it becomes -- it -- and I,
you know, I have- I have spoken

814
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,719
about this before,

814
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,000
but I have ADHD too, right? And
it's like-

815
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,500
Ryan: Oh, yeah.
[Unintelligible].

815
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,700
Dan: -the- the idea of like,
"Oh, okay, I need docs," right?

816
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,443
This is like the thing

816
00:42:00,443 --> 00:42:02,244
that pops in my head, right?
Like, there's nothing here. I

817
00:42:02,244 --> 00:42:05,500
need docs. But then, like, what
are, like, I -- it's just such a

818
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:05,903
huge thing to try to-

819
00:42:05,903 --> 00:42:06,000
Ryan: Yeah.

818
00:42:05,963 --> 00:42:08,934
Dan: -do. Like you said, it's
like writing a book, almost. And

819
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:10,673
you know that, like, I mean, and
then when you start thinking

820
00:42:10,673 --> 00:42:13,463
about it, you know it's going to
be out of date immediately and --

821
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:16,943
oh my gosh. So now it's like
huge chunk of work to begin with.

822
00:42:16,943 --> 00:42:17,000
Ryan: I know.

822
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Dan: And then, also huge
annoying chunk of works, like,

823
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,500
chunks of work, to keep-

824
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:21,700
Ryan: Yeah.

825
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,000
Dan: -it up to date. And it just
seems impossible in my head

824
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,594
sometimes, you know? I'm --

825
00:42:24,818 --> 00:42:26,500
Ryan: Well, you know, when I
worked at Dropbox, just to be

826
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,000
wi- the things that were wild,
we had librarians [chuckles].

827
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:29,500
Dan: Oh, man.

827
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,900
Ryan: Technical librarians.

828
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,200 
Bekah: Whoa.

829
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,000
Dan: Yeah, well, that's
[unintelligible] --

830
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Ryan: Who's, like, literally --

828
00:42:32,574 --> 00:42:32,934
Dan: I mean, like, that --

829
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Bekah: Hey, that's I wanna be. A
technical librarian

830
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,000
[Dan laughs].

831
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,700
Ryan: Yeah, I can connect them
to you.

832
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,500
Bekah: I didn't know that
was a thing.

831
00:42:38,048 --> 00:42:39,159
Ryan: I can connect you to if
you want.

832
00:42:39,384 --> 00:42:42,173
Dan: That sounds awesome. I
mean, like, that's the kind of

833
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:45,700
thing you- you -- the -- once
your company grows in size,

834
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,000
like, you know,

834
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,023
you can start having people
that have jobs of, you know,

835
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:50,300
specific jobs, right? And in
smaller teams, you have to do

836
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,500
everything, right? And that's-
that's a very cool. I- I wonder

837
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,700
if there's some-

837
00:42:55,179 --> 00:42:56,139
Ryan: Once you get -- that's-
that's a big [unintelligible].

838
00:42:56,244 --> 00:42:59,648
Dan: -I wonder if there's like
a consulting -- technical

839
00:42:59,648 --> 00:43:02,000
librarians that can consult ...
Well, I mean [unintelligible] --

840
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,199
Ryan: Well, generally, there are
technical --

841
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,608
Bekah: That's really what I
wanna do. I wanna be a-

842
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:04,478
Dan: Yeah. I mean, like --

843
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,289
Bekah: -consulting technical
librarian.

844
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,338
Dan: Right, right, right. So --
yeah.

845
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,768
Bekah: You evaluate, you put the
books back in the right order.

846
00:43:09,000 -->00:43:09,300
Ryan: Yeah.

846
00:43:09,699 --> 00:43:10,539
Dan: Yeah, because like --

847
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,619
Bekah: Say, you don't wanna
miscategorized.

848
00:43:12,338 --> 00:43:14,259
Dan: Right. And then, keeping it
up to date. Like, if you have

849
00:43:14,264 --> 00:43:17,048
somebody that is not a full-time
employee, right? But somebody

850
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:21,969
who's -- like, all right. The
first run through would be a big

851
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:24,009
project, right? But like, after
that, it's like maintenance

852
00:43:24,009 --> 00:43:26,679
stuff. Maybe a couple hours --
whatever. A week or a month, you

853
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:29,498
know, whatever it is. But like,
that -- man, alright. I have to

854
00:43:29,498 --> 00:43:29,918
think this about this one.
That sounds- that sounds awesome.

855
00:43:30,054 --> 00:43:33,023
Ryan: No, I- I agree. It's-
it's- it's a- it's a huge task.

856
00:43:33,023 --> 00:43:35,800
And so, like, having specialized
people is really valuable.

857
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,700
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

857
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,000
Ryan: But, you know, also -- but
they're -- they don't

858
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
necessarily have the context.

858
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,664
So they're just sort of like
organizing, making sure things

859
00:43:41,664 --> 00:43:43,500
are formatted correctly, making
sure things are-

860
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:43,700
Dan: Right.

861
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,514
Ryan: -linked correctly.

860
00:43:44,844 --> 00:43:47,153
But, you know, the knowledge has
to come sort of ultimately from

861
00:43:47,153 --> 00:43:49,344
the people who are on the
[unintelligible], you know?

862
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,700
Dan: Totally. Totally. But if-
but if somebody's like -- and

863
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,063
that -- this is, like, you know,

863
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,300
speaking of something that I've
done that is not well documented

864
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,500
or whatever, but somebody asks
me a question about it, then

865
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,000
I'm, like, can talk about it for
a while. You know what I mean?

866
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,684
But then-

867
00:44:00,684 --> 00:44:01,224
Ryan: Yeah.

866
00:44:01,224 --> 00:44:03,300
Dan: -and you mentioned, like
sla- like those async, you know,

867
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:03,563
learning

867
00:44:03,563 --> 00:44:05,364
channels and stuff like that.
That's this kind of thing. And

868
00:44:05,364 --> 00:44:08,543
then -- but then it gets buried
in a Slack, you know, thread

869
00:44:08,548 --> 00:44:10,000
somewhere and disappears cuz-

870
00:44:10,000 -->00:44:10,300
Ryan: Oh, yeah.

871
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,083
Dan: -we don't pay for Slack
[laughs]. You know, and

870
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:12,700
all that stuff, right?

871
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,000
Ryan: Yeah [laughs].

872
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,653
Dan: And so ... oh, man. I- I
like the idea of

871
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,173
having somebody, an outside
person -- plus, like, if you see

872
00:44:18,173 --> 00:44:20,873
somebody do -- I'm sorry I'm
talking about this so much. But

873
00:44:20,873 --> 00:44:21,500
I'm excited about it now
[laughs].

874
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,000
Bekah: No, that's fine.

875
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,204
Dan: But if you- if you, like,
if me, as- as, like, the ...

874
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:26,693
whatever. A lead developer on a
project, and you have an outside

875
00:44:26,693 --> 00:44:30,233
person that comes and gets
something going or adds an

876
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:32,574
addition, you'll be able to like
-- I would be able to, like, see

877
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:35,003
if it's wrong or needs some,
like -- not wrong, but, you

878
00:44:35,003 --> 00:44:37,500
know, need some, like, tweaks or
whatever. And that's an easier

879
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,034
job than-

879
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:39,878
Ryan: Well, there's a value to
--

880
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Dan: -than starting from the-
starting from the beginning

881
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,634
[chuckles], right?

881
00:44:41,858 --> 00:44:43,700
Ryan: It's a value to an
external perspective. That's

882
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,168
what I always

882
00:44:44,168 --> 00:44:47,978
say about myself is like, you
know, you've tried things, you

883
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:51,548
have a context about how things
work. I can come in as with an

884
00:44:51,548 --> 00:44:54,458
external perspective and provide
additional value that you

885
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,000
otherwise wouldn't get, you
know?

886
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,300
Dan: Totally.

887
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,608
Ryan: It's kind of like -- I'm
trying

886
00:44:57,608 --> 00:45:00,159
to think of an explanation. It's
cross-pollination, you know what

887
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,119
I mean? It's like you're getting
sort of information or wi-

888
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,000
genetic information from an
external source. And that

889
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,748
creates a better ... sort

889
00:45:07,748 --> 00:45:10,809
of, you know, better result. If
you just kind of like, I don't

890
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:13,389
wanna get into, like, genetics.
But it's like, you know, you

891
00:45:13,389 --> 00:45:15,700
don't wanna just- just breed the
same genes over and over again.

892
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,500
It creates sort of problems. And
so it's like you need that

893
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,208
external information, external
perspective. And, you know, I

894
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:24,099
think every company needs that.
And that's kinda what you get

895
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:25,000
when you hire people, right?

896
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,300
Bekah: Yeah.

897
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,300
Ryan: You're hiring-

898
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:26,500
Dan: Totally.

899
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:26,949
Ryan: -someone, they come

896
00:45:26,949 --> 00:45:30,309
in with their own sort of
knowledge, and abilities, and --

897
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:32,500
but, you know, if you can just
-- you can also hire a

898
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:32,708
consultant,

898
00:45:32,768 --> 00:45:35,228
you know? And they- and they can
provide the same sort of thing on

899
00:45:35,228 --> 00:45:38,300
a more temporary sort of basis
and less -- you know,

900
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:38,994
ultimately, less

900
00:45:38,994 --> 00:45:42,114
cost, right? You know, than
hiring somebody. But over-

901
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,364
over, you know, if they come in
for three months and you cost

902
00:45:44,364 --> 00:45:47,844
this much, hiring someone for a
year and maybe not having them do

903
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:50,273
the same work is, you know, a
different- different calculus.

904
00:45:50,273 --> 00:45:52,583
But, yeah. External perspective
is very valuable.

905
00:45:54,909 --> 00:45:58,764
Dan: I love that. You've given me
a lot to think about [laughs].

906
00:45:58,764 --> 00:45:59,094
Ryan: Yeah. That's good.

906
00:45:59,094 --> 00:46:01,284
Dan: I mean, I'll- I'll -- every
time we- every time we met --

907
00:46:01,373 --> 00:46:02,693
Ryan: We have to talk about it
some more. Yeah.

908
00:46:03,054 --> 00:46:05,724
Dan: Yeah. I always- I always end
up coming away with a- with a lot

909
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:06,954
of stuff to think about. All of
that.

910
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,563
Ryan: Yeah. Well, that's the
point, right? Is like -- that's

911
00:46:09,563 --> 00:46:12,804
the -- I have the external
perspective, and you're learning

912
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:17,273
from it. And I'm learning from
yours. That's sort of the- the

913
00:46:17,278 --> 00:46:21,384
ultimate idea, right? Is like we
learn from each other. That's why

914
00:46:21,384 --> 00:46:24,000
we have conversations. It's not
to, like -- I'm not, like,

915
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,523
telling you stuff. I wanna
listen, you know?

916
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:31,700
Bekah: Yeah. That's so
important, that idea of

917
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,784
listening. Cuz it's

917
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:38,364
hard to do and so much of the
time we spend listening to

918
00:46:38,364 --> 00:46:42,599
respond to other people rather
than just listening to

919
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:47,248
understand people. And I think,
that's -- it's a hard thing to

920
00:46:47,248 --> 00:46:53,039
do, but it's a good habit to
work on in- in any situation.

921
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:56,300
But especially, if you're on a
team of diverse people or-

922
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:56,500
Ryan: Oh, yeah.

922
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,539
Bekah: -I- I think, too-

923
00:46:57,539 --> 00:46:59,000
Ryan: Well, hopefully you are
[laughs].

924
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,800
Bekah: -if you're working
remotely. It --

922
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,244
Ryan: Yeah. I think that
listening, it

923
00:47:01,273 --> 00:47:04,393
requires empathy, right? But it-
it's more than that. I think it

924
00:47:04,423 --> 00:47:06,673
-- because empathy comes from
letting go of yourself.

925
00:47:06,778 --> 00:47:07,389
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

926
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,463
Ryan: You know, if you come into
a listening situation without

927
00:47:09,463 --> 00:47:12,554
compassion, which is literally
just like not putting yourself in

928
00:47:12,554 --> 00:47:14,503
the other person's shoes, but
just not even- just not even

929
00:47:14,503 --> 00:47:17,293
really imagining, you know what
I mean? You just kind of let go

930
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,700
of your own preconceived notions
and- and listen to the person.

931
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,434
And then,

931
00:47:21,434 --> 00:47:23,764
when they're done, you come out
of it and try to integrate it.

932
00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:26,059
Then you can come up with some
advice. But if you're sitting

933
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:28,369
there in your head sort of
calculating like, "Oh, this is

934
00:47:28,369 --> 00:47:31,000
my answer. This is my answer.
This is how I think about it.

935
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,338
This is

935
00:47:31,338 --> 00:47:34,639
how," you know? Then you're not
really listening. You're like, I

936
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:36,289
don't know what it is, but
you're not listening, you know?

937
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:40,248
Listening is really like letting
go of yourself for a moment,

938
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:43,818
completely, as much as possible,
and just being present with the

939
00:47:43,978 --> 00:47:46,664
other person. And really like
trying to -- that's how empathy

940
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:49,300
comes. It's not from, like,
relating it to your experience,

941
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:49,603
your own sort

941
00:47:49,603 --> 00:47:53,653
of hurts, and desires, and, you
know, suffering or whatever you

942
00:47:53,653 --> 00:47:56,264
wanna put it, you know? In the
Buddhist sense I would say. But

943
00:47:56,268 --> 00:47:59,114
yeah, you know, it's really just
kind of listening and being there

944
00:47:59,114 --> 00:48:02,264
for the other person. And then,
after they're done, you come

945
00:48:02,264 --> 00:48:05,023
back, and you go, "Wow," you
know, "I really learn from that

946
00:48:05,023 --> 00:48:07,600
perspective," you know? Cuz it's
-- ultimately, listening is

947
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:07,784
learning,

947
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:10,664
right? And the way you learn is
not by -- is by integrating, but

948
00:48:10,664 --> 00:48:13,300
first, sort of, you know,
transporting yourself to

949
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,809
another- another way of being
in other perspective.

950
00:48:17,804 --> 00:48:21,014
Bekah: Yeah. I love that. Well,
Ryan, it's about time for us to

951
00:48:21,014 --> 00:48:22,000
wrap up. Is-

952
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,300
Ryan: Yeah.

953
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,653
Bekah: -there one tip that you
can leave our listeners with,

952
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:31,603
to help them get started in this
idea of building better teams

953
00:48:31,603 --> 00:48:34,543
through empathy and listening?

954
00:48:35,969 --> 00:48:40,574
Ryan: Wow. That's a good
question. I think it's being,

955
00:48:40,574 --> 00:48:43,273
you know, compassion is very
important. There's a big push

956
00:48:43,273 --> 00:48:46,873
these days for compassionate
coding, for compassionate teams.

957
00:48:47,353 --> 00:48:49,903
And you know, I've been on some
teams as well that just don't --

958
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:53,474
there's some lack of disconnected
compassion, you know? And so

959
00:48:53,474 --> 00:48:57,014
being gentle with each other,
being empathetic as you said, is

960
00:48:57,014 --> 00:49:01,300
such an important skill and such
an important, you know,

961
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,000
component of being a team.

961
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
That listening aspect of really
kind of letting go of yourself

962
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,378
and connecting with another
person is -- you know, and

963
00:49:10,378 --> 00:49:12,500
then- and then sharing
knowledge, you know, is, like,

964
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:12,809
that's- that's --

964
00:49:12,813 --> 00:49:15,208
the- the basis of sharing
knowledge is connecting with the

965
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:18,148
other person's experience.
You're just talking at them and

966
00:49:18,153 --> 00:49:21,000
saying, "Read the docs," you
know? Like, that's not how you

967
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
connect with the person,

967
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,300
and then connect -- because
ultimately, the knowledge, as

968
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:24,568
I said,

968
00:49:24,568 --> 00:49:28,523
is, like, about connecting some
sort of theory to your personal

969
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:31,554
experience, you know? That's how
you transfer knowledge, is I

970
00:49:31,554 --> 00:49:34,798
tell you, this is my experience.
Or you tell me first. I think

971
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:37,648
you have to ask questions first,
you know? Ask questions first,

972
00:49:37,648 --> 00:49:40,000
and listen. And then see -- you
say, "This is my experience."

973
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Then I go, "Oh," you know,
"based on what I think, this

974
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,228
is how I might connect with what

974
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:45,659
you said. This is how I might
connect with you as a person."

975
00:49:46,139 --> 00:49:48,239
So, I don't know if that makes
sense to your question, but

976
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:50,200
that's what I would say, is
being gentle, being

977
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,000
compassionate first.

977
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,708
And not trying to just kind of
grind people, you know? Cuz

978
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:57,739
that's really how you lose your
team. It's how you lose kind of

979
00:49:57,739 --> 00:50:00,259
the knowledge that people have
when they leave is you burn them

980
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:02,509
out. And you're not being
compassionate. And I think it's

981
00:50:02,509 --> 00:50:05,478
so tough on a corporate level to
be compassionate cuz there's the

982
00:50:05,483 --> 00:50:08,418
profit motive, and business
needs, and all this stuff. But

983
00:50:08,418 --> 00:50:11,059
if you can really kind of let
that go and say, "Look, we're

984
00:50:11,059 --> 00:50:13,300
gonna care about our people
first," that will reap the

985
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:13,909
rewards, you know?

985
00:50:14,173 --> 00:50:17,054
That'll reap the rewards more
than like, you know, burning

986
00:50:17,054 --> 00:50:19,244
people out for a business end,
you know what I mean? Like,

987
00:50:19,244 --> 00:50:22,423
there's more to life. You're a
person too. The CEO's a person,

988
00:50:22,423 --> 00:50:24,164
you know? They don't wanna --
they wanna go golfing or

989
00:50:24,164 --> 00:50:26,623
whatever. They don't wanna,
like, you know, just be burning

990
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:30,193
themselves out and, you know, to
like, to- to- to make money, I

991
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,300
think, ultimately. Maybe they
do. But that's sort of my

992
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:33,614
opinion, is

992
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:36,253
like, you wanna build a great
team, be compassionate. And play

993
00:50:36,253 --> 00:50:38,474
golf, I guess, you know? Let
them play golf. I don't know

994
00:50:38,474 --> 00:50:40,500
what do they wanna do [Bekah and
Dan chuckle]. I play disc golf.

995
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,300
But, you know-

00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:41,500
Dan: Yes!

995
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,700
Ryan: -let people be themselves.
And I think, that's -- you also

996
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,213
have to accept

996
00:50:44,213 --> 00:50:46,974
that people don't work the same
hours, people don't have the

997
00:50:46,974 --> 00:50:48,500
same accommodations. Like,
that's where com- that's where

998
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,500
compassion comes in, is like
understanding the diversity of

999
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,074
people and

999
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:54,443
trying to make them productive
and not trying to put them on a

1000
00:50:54,443 --> 00:50:56,700
clock, and like- like, where,
you know, in the- in the Henry

1001
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:00,000
Ford factory, it's creative
work. You really need to kind of

1002
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,500
disconnect from that idea of,
like, you know, hours, and time,

1003
00:51:04,074 --> 00:51:04,074
and productivity.

1003
00:51:06,409 --> 00:51:08,000
Bekah: Wow. That was a great way
to end the episode.

1004
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,000
Dan: Yeah. Amazing.

1004
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,384
Bekah: Thank you so much, Ryan.

1004
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,188
Dan: Thanks, Ryan. Thanks for
coming on.

1005
00:51:11,994 --> 00:51:13,733
Ryan: Of course. It's so
wonderful to talk to you both,

1006
00:51:13,733 --> 00:51:16,704
the two people I really respect,
and have great connection with,

1007
00:51:16,704 --> 00:51:19,313
and it's so nice to be able to
spend time with you. And, you

1008
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:21,000
know, I guess recorded, but ...
just to-

1009
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,300
Dan: Yeah, sure.

1110
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:21,713
Ryan: -spend time with you is
really nice.

1009
00:51:21,728 --> 00:51:22,148
Bekah: Yeah.

1010
00:51:22,628 --> 00:51:25,478
Dan: Yeah. Agreed. Alright.
Yeah, we'll talk to you later.

1011
00:51:25,778 --> 00:51:26,349
Bekah: Thank you.

1012
00:51:26,423 --> 00:51:27,264
Ryan: Oh, you talk to me now
[Ryan and Bekah laugh].

1013
00:51:29,139 --> 00:51:30,159
Dan: Oh, and also later.

1014
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,454
Ryan: And also later. Yeah. I
love you, guys.

1015
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:33,000
Dan: Alright.

1016
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,300
Bekah: Bye.
