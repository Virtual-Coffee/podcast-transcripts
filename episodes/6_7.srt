Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello and
welcome to Season 6, Episode 7

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:06,695
of the

2
00:00:06,695 --> 00:00:12,111
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah, and this is a podcast that

3
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:16,221
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:19,041
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:21,951
coding journey, and they're here
on this podcast sharing their

6
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:24,771
stories and what they've learned,
and we are here to share it with

7
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:27,670
you. Here with me today is my
co-host, Dan.

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,690
Dan Ott: What Wuddup Bek? How's
it going?

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,750
Bekah: It is. It is going well.
How's it going with?

10
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:37,926
Dan: It's going okay. Yeah,
we have a great episode today. We

11
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:41,286
met with Ryan Kahn, who has
done a lot of things through his

12
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:44,453
career. He was a teacher, he's a
developer, and, now Ryan is a

13
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:47,482
consultant who comes and helps
teams improve their collaboration

14
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:49,103
and their communication skills.

15
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:51,996
Bekah: I loved how Ryan talked
about the importance of

16
00:00:52,002 --> 00:00:57,741
empathizing with your teammates.
And treating each person as an

17
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:01,762
individual human being who makes
up your team. I think that that's

18
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:06,352
a really great approach in order
to, you know, empower your team

19
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:10,792
to do what they can do and the
best ways that they can do it.

20
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:15,906
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. I, I mean,
it was, it was, Ryan's, I

21
00:01:15,906 --> 00:01:19,477
mean, Ryan's always great to talk
to you. And yeah, and that,

22
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:22,477
that, like, that, that
philosophy, I think, I don't

23
00:01:22,477 --> 00:01:24,576
know, lines up a lot with a lot
of the stuff we talk about here

24
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:27,277
at Virtual Coffee. So, it was
nice to hear him talk about it,

25
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:32,647
and it's nice that he is,
he's doing this, like he's, I was

26
00:01:32,652 --> 00:01:35,917
very interested to hear about his
consultancy, and his like,

27
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:39,337
sort of new journey that he is
doing because, it's a little

28
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:42,427
bit of a different approach than,
you know, most people, I'm, I'm a

29
00:01:42,427 --> 00:01:46,177
consultant myself, but I just
kind of come in. Do like the

30
00:01:46,177 --> 00:01:49,087
work, right? Or like, you know,
the kind of stuff you, you think

31
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:52,417
about, right? And this is more,
Ryan's gonna come in and help

32
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:56,046
teams, improve their whole
situation, right? And then leave

33
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:59,016
you know? And I think that's
really great. I think it's a, I

34
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:01,927
think it's a very cool thing to
do. And I was excited to hear

35
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:02,197
about it.

36
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:07,311
Bekah: It is really something
that I think is undervalued too.

37
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:10,252
So I think that a lot of teams
experience these problems and

38
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:15,201
they just end up having a lot of
turnover. Or things like that,

39
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:19,912
and there's not a huge focus on
what Ryan's doing, but I think

40
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:22,671
it's something that should be
focused on. It's really needed in

41
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:23,301
the industry.

42
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:25,896
Dan: Yeah, I agree.

43
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:30,051
Bekah: Well, we start every
episode of the podcast, like we

44
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:32,651
start every virtual coffee. We
introduce ourselves with our

45
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:35,532
name, where we're from, what we
do, and a random check-in

46
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:47,187
question. We hope you enjoy this
episode. Today's intro question

47
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:51,537
is if you could remove one task
from your day, what would it be?

48
00:02:52,646 --> 00:02:55,826
My name is Bekah. I am a
technical community builder from

49
00:02:55,826 --> 00:03:02,456
a small town in Ohio, and if I
could remove one task I email or

50
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:05,306
no meetings, can I remove
meetings? That's kind of like

51
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:09,387
general, but I would get rid of
most of them.

52
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:13,812
Dan: So all meetings. All right.

53
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:18,852
Bekah: Only the only ones I wanna
get rid of. The ones without

54
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:21,312
agendas. Those ones.

55
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:22,122
Dan: Sure.

56
00:03:22,197 --> 00:03:22,377
Ryan Kahn: one.

57
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,766
Dan: Yeah. Well, this isn't a
meeting, this is, this isn't an

58
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:26,157
event,

59
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,981
Bekah: Mm-hmm. this is an event.

60
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:32,787
Dan: Alright. Hi, I'm Dan. I
am in Cleveland. I do website

61
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:36,387
development. And, yeah, I
think the first thing that popped

62
00:03:36,387 --> 00:03:39,537
into my mind was like bedtime
stuff with the kids. I, I don't

63
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:42,236
mind like the, all the way at the
end reading books and stuff, but

64
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:45,176
it's all the, you know, bath and
whatever, all that nonsense. But

65
00:03:45,176 --> 00:03:48,227
then I think actually it's
getting them in the car.

66
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:49,056
Bekah: Oh,

67
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:51,806
Dan: There's, I, my, you know, I
still a three old and a six year

68
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:54,986
old, and so they're still all,
both in car seats, you know, and

69
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:57,236
all that stuff. And doesn't
matter where we're going, what

70
00:03:57,236 --> 00:04:00,417
we're doing, it takes just for
like ever, like I sell them to go

71
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,667
outside cause they can get into
the car by themselves, you know?

72
00:04:03,086 --> 00:04:04,856
And I tell 'em to go outside and
get in the car and I go outside

73
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:07,317
and they're just like wandering
around in the garage or whatever,

74
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:10,407
you know, and like, just, just
get in the car. We just need to

75
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:14,247
go. This is, we don't have to do
this every time. And like playing

76
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:16,107
with toys while trying to get
them buckled and all this stuff.

77
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:18,776
So that's gonna be my answer.
Yeah. Putting the kids in the

78
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:21,627
car, they could just like snap
and they would just be strapp in

79
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:21,956
the car.

80
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:24,357
Bekah: with their shoes on too,
right?

81
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:26,276
Dan: Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Exactly. Yeah.

82
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:28,916
Bekah: don't know how many times
we've been in the car and a kid

83
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:32,336
doesn't have shoes. Like my kids
are all. Older. My youngest is

84
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:36,836
five and a half, but frequently
we end up in the car and like one

85
00:04:36,836 --> 00:04:40,857
kid's like, Oh, I didn't bring
any shoes. Like, Why? What? How

86
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:43,857
is thing? Like you just always,
You didn't tell me I needed to

87
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:46,586
put on shoes. You always put on
shoes if you're getting in the

88
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,396
car, like,

89
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:54,312
Ryan: Standard operating
procedure. Okay, well, I'm Ryan.

90
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:57,701
I am a, developer, experience
consultant and productivity

91
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:00,432
consultant in New York City. A
little, little town in New York

92
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:04,451
called New York City. My
daughter is little over one year

93
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:07,661
old, so getting her in the car is
very easy. We just pick her up

94
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:09,762
and put her in and she doesn't
have much of a choice about it.

95
00:05:09,762 --> 00:05:13,002
And if she needs shoes, we put
'em on. And yeah, meetings,

96
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:15,221
I actually like meetings. I
think that that's when I do my

97
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:19,857
best work. So I won't say that. I
will say, That is the one thing

98
00:05:19,857 --> 00:05:24,206
that my wife and I have the most
tension about is actually just

99
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:27,297
doing the dishes. Cause neither
one of us likes to do it. So

100
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:31,166
I would remove that from my day
in a heartbeat. Just, I mean,

101
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,507
I would want clean dishes. I
wouldn't wanna just not do it and

102
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:35,666
have dirty dishes, but if the
dishes get clean regardless,

103
00:05:35,672 --> 00:05:37,706
that's what I would pick.
Yeah.

104
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:42,252
Dan: Yeah, I actually, of all the
like household chores that you

105
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:44,471
have to do all the time dishes
are like one of the easiest ones

106
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:48,072
for me. Like, know, I, chores are
like a paint, I don't mean easy,

107
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:51,492
like easy to get myself to do,
you know? I think I can

108
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:53,651
listen to podcasts and stuff, and
so it's, I don't know.

109
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:55,091
Ryan: Yeah. It's rather
meditative

110
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:58,601
Dan: when I'm doing the dishes.
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Like if

111
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:02,172
I'm doing that chore, then, you
know, every. Somebody else is

112
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:03,372
dealing with the kids

113
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:05,831
Ryan: Hmm. A little break.

114
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:08,201
Dan: Oh man. But I don't like
putting the dishes away.

115
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:09,252
Honestly. That's my,

116
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:10,661
Ryan: Oh,

117
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:13,182
Dan: don't mind cleaning them.
It's like putting them away is

118
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:14,711
the thing that always bumps me.

119
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:18,117
Ryan: Our dishwasher's actually
broken right now, all the dishes

120
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:19,987
are done by hand, which is
probably why it's front of mine

121
00:06:19,987 --> 00:06:20,346
for me

122
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:24,851
Bekah: Our dishwasher was broke
for like over a month and it was,

123
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:29,442
it was the source of a lot of
tension in the house. Like we

124
00:06:29,442 --> 00:06:32,442
have four kids and then some of
them like take plates in their

125
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:35,682
rooms and then you've got like
crusty dishes, like, what are you

126
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:36,242
doing?

127
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:38,596
Ryan: and my wife does.

128
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:44,141
Bekah: Well Ryan, we are very
happy to have you here with us

129
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:47,982
today to talk about. A lot of
different things, but building

130
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:50,951
better teams I think is gonna be
a great source of our

131
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:55,572
conversation. But before we get
to that, let's hear your origin

132
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:58,771
story. So how did you get to this
point in your tech career?

133
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:02,007
Ryan: Yeah, thanks. I mean, I
always approach this story a

134
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:05,817
little differently every time I
tell it. I mean, I've always

135
00:07:05,817 --> 00:07:08,531
been interested in computers,
right when I was a kid. I

136
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:10,872
remember the first kind of
computer programming thing,

137
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:13,812
computer programming thing that I
did was, there was a video game I

138
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:17,112
liked to play and it was kind of
like Iron Man mode where like if

139
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:20,232
you die, you die. And I, I had a
big career in the game and then I

140
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:23,112
died and I was like, Oh my God. I
was so depressed. Probably the

141
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:26,442
first time I was ever depressed
in my life that I remember was I

142
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:30,351
dying in this game. And so I came
in and I, I took the save game

143
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:32,932
file and I switched around the
bits and made myself alive again,

144
00:07:33,742 --> 00:07:36,651
And so that's where I started
out. I think with the, you

145
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:39,052
know, I always was interested in
dos and kind of playing video

146
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:42,081
games, and so I've been talking
to the computer for many years,

147
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:45,507
is what I call it, through the
terminal. But yeah, I never

148
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,057
considered it as a career. You
know, I had a teacher in high

149
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:51,987
school who got me into economics.
And so I decided to study

150
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:54,927
that in college. But, you know,
college didn't really agree with

151
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:58,286
me for mental health reasons. And
so I dropped out and I was

152
00:07:58,286 --> 00:08:01,317
working actually on a loading
dock. Cause I had a, a cdl, like

153
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:04,137
a truck license, but I couldn't
find a job driving a truck. So I

154
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:06,627
got a job loading the trucks. It
was the middle of the, it was in

155
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:08,966
the middle of the night. It was,
you know, I learned a lot on that

156
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:12,776
job about hard work. But, you
know, it wasn't really what I

157
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:16,586
wanted to do long term. And a
friend of mine who I met in

158
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:19,257
college was like, Hey, do you
wanna be a software engineer? So,

159
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:21,807
I mean, this is kind of the, the
height of privilege, right? It's

160
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:24,447
like someone just offers you a
job and you don't have to apply.

161
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:28,286
And you know, like I, I, I feel
for everybody these days who is

162
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:30,716
looking for a job as a software
engineer and really kind of has

163
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:33,626
to look and look and look. You
know, for me it just fell in my

164
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:36,417
lap even when I wasn't looking
for it. So a lot of privilege.

165
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:40,136
And, yeah, so, you know, I
started off doing that job. It

166
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:43,346
was like a government contracting
job. I actually really enjoyed

167
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:46,466
it. I remember the first problem
I solved, which was putting a

168
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:50,157
ClickHandler on a button, And,
you know, I, I solved it sort of

169
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:53,277
the, I put put it in the HTML as
like text, which is, you know,

170
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:56,937
not how you even did it back then
with J Query and stuff like that.

171
00:08:57,581 --> 00:09:01,991
This was back in 2009. And
yeah, so I didn't even solve it

172
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:04,331
kind of the right way, but the
elation of having solved a

173
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:07,241
problem was huge and I kind of
tried to stay close to that

174
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:10,032
feeling. Kind of like, you
know, with switching the bit in

175
00:09:10,037 --> 00:09:12,221
the save game file, just trying
to stay close to that feeling

176
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:18,581
throughout my career. So I
did that for about four years.

177
00:09:18,672 --> 00:09:21,011
You know, my boss was like, I'm
not gonna pay you anymore than

178
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:22,991
you're making now. And I was
like, Well, I could make more

179
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:27,912
money. So I went to another job,
a private sector job, cuz the

180
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:30,721
first job was a government
contracting job. And, You know, I

181
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:34,111
enjoyed that too. You know, it's,
it was in DC It's not like a big

182
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:37,201
market. So the company that I
worked for was a little bit, you

183
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,381
know, janky, I would say kinda
like the first one. But I

184
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,182
learned a lot at that job. I
worked with a lot of great

185
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:45,331
engineers, learned a lot
about what I didn't want in a

186
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:49,201
job. And at the same time, I,
I went to a meetup for

187
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:52,062
general Assembly and they asked
me, Someone just came up and

188
00:09:52,062 --> 00:09:53,772
said, Hey, do you wanna be a
teacher? And I immediately said,

189
00:09:53,772 --> 00:09:56,741
yes. It's something I hadn't
really thought about, but I was

190
00:09:56,741 --> 00:09:59,412
always on Stack overflow, just
kind of answering questions and,

191
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,471
and so it just was an immediate
yes for me. Like I just kind of,

192
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:05,501
it blurred outta my mouth, you
know, like joy without me even

193
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:09,971
thinking about it. And, yeah,
so I, I did some teaching, a

194
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:12,912
general assembly, and that was
sort of the end of my programming

195
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,522
career, even though it lasted for
another seven years or something.

196
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:18,971
Actually, I don't know how
long, but it lasted for a long

197
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:22,241
time after that, even though
I decide, I decided at that point

198
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:25,572
that I wanted to solve human
problems, in software and not

199
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:28,121
so much solve the, the
programming problems, but I kept

200
00:10:28,302 --> 00:10:31,812
grinding at it for many years.
Moved to New York. It's

201
00:10:31,812 --> 00:10:36,027
continued to teach at a company
called Thankful. Just worked

202
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:39,177
at Squarespace first and then
Dropbox, and then eventually

203
00:10:39,177 --> 00:10:42,746
just, you know, kind of burnt out
on development. Cuz again, I,

204
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:45,027
I kind of had already found
something in my calling a little

205
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:49,496
bit, in something else
related. And so now I work as a

206
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:52,557
consultant. And I guess we
can talk about that, but yeah,

207
00:10:52,557 --> 00:10:56,486
it's, you know, what I'm trying
to do is help teams be more

208
00:10:56,486 --> 00:11:01,542
knowledgeable and more
productive, and. Deliver kind

209
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:04,272
of on a promise of quality, you
know, and, and, and timelines.

210
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:06,822
So that's what I'm trying to
do as a consultant. But that was

211
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:10,481
sort of an evolution from
teaching, you know, from

212
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:13,902
teaching and, and solving human
problems. So that kind of brings

213
00:11:13,902 --> 00:11:15,881
me to where I'm at today. And
then, you know, of course I'm in

214
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:19,331
vc, which is a wonderful
community. And that's been a

215
00:11:19,331 --> 00:11:23,052
source of great joy for me.
And you'll make other communities

216
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:26,292
that I'm in, but this is kind of
the main one that I, I appreciate

217
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:28,032
the most. So yeah, that's kind of
where I'm at.

218
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,996
Dan: We're the, we're the best
one, obviously, so

219
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:36,417
Ryan: Well, the most welcoming
right the most welcoming tech

220
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,996
community. I've started to get
the invite, so I'm really happy

221
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:41,697
about that. I hope we can
continue to expand at a, at a

222
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,027
measured rate, with, you
know, people who are aligned with

223
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:45,596
the vision.

224
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:49,902
Dan: Yeah. That's been so fun to
have new people back, you know,

225
00:11:50,052 --> 00:11:51,942
coming back in. It's been, it's
really

226
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,817
Ryan: Yeah. I invited ahead.

227
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,792
Dan: ahead. I was just gonna say
thank you for that story, but.

228
00:11:58,346 --> 00:12:00,687
Ryan: Yeah. Okay. Sure. Yeah.
Yeah. It's, it's, it's a

229
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,836
story that, has other parts
to it. Of course, it's hard to

230
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:07,167
kind of like capture a, the
multidimensional nature of human

231
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:11,126
beings in a, in a short blurb.
But yeah, happy to talk more

232
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:12,297
about it as we go forward.

233
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:17,817
Bekah: there a moment in when you
were teaching that you really

234
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:22,586
felt, this is what I wanna be
doing, Or do you think the whole

235
00:12:22,586 --> 00:12:25,736
experience just kind of led you
down this path?

236
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:28,812
Ryan: Well, there was a moment
when I was like, This is not what

237
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:31,731
I want to do. Right in the
beginning. You know, I taught

238
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:34,822
htm, I taught a front end course,
a general assembly, and you know,

239
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:37,461
I taught HTML and it was great. I
was like, Oh my God, I'm such a

240
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:41,211
good teacher. People love me. I'm
getting great reviews. Like this

241
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:45,351
is what I want to do. And then we
got into JavaScript And to be

242
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:47,692
fair, there was no curriculum,
you know what I mean? Like this,

243
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:50,751
they just opened this office and
General Assembly was rather, I

244
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:54,836
don't know how young it was, but
it seemed. Pretty startupy. And

245
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:57,297
so there was no curriculum, so I
had to make it up as I went. And

246
00:12:57,297 --> 00:13:00,596
you know, I didn't do a good job
at that initially. It's very

247
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:05,096
tough to teach JavaScript. And
so, I got all these bad

248
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:08,126
reviews. People love me still cuz
I'm like a nice person, but they

249
00:13:08,126 --> 00:13:11,456
were like, he's a nice person but
he's not a good teacher. And

250
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:14,942
so that was sort of a lesson for
me. It's like, okay, prepare. How

251
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:17,971
do you actually, you know, teach
really hard material to pe to a

252
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:21,511
variety of people? So I learned a
lot from that. But you know, the

253
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:23,822
initial kind of, you know, I
wouldn't say high, but the

254
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:28,351
initial sort of like, joy of
teaching was that first kind of

255
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:31,591
semester part of it, the first
half of the course. And I really

256
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:33,782
enjoyed that. And that kind of
carried me through even the tough

257
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:38,162
time of like, you know, not doing
well. But I also realized

258
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:40,442
from that, that I wanted to do
individualized mentorship more

259
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:43,976
than I wanted to do. Teaching in
general, you know, and I still

260
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:47,277
kind of struggle whether I wanna
do conference talks or cuz I do

261
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:49,527
like what I can do in
conversation rather than what I

262
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:52,976
do in kind of multiplexing, if
you will, to a bunch of people.

263
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:56,277
So yeah, I think teaching is
great. I do enjoy kind of getting

264
00:13:56,277 --> 00:13:58,797
up in front of people actually in
the, the kind of nervousness of

265
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,886
that. And, but I do enjoy the
individualized mentorship better

266
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:05,216
and that's kind of where I, I
think I shine is pair programming

267
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:07,256
and, you know, conversations. So,

268
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:13,647
Dan: Yeah, that's, that's really
cool. I was, I was, I think

269
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:16,287
that's actually the answer, but I
was gonna ask, you know, you

270
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:17,937
talked when you were talking
about, before you were

271
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:21,567
teaching, that feeling,
right, the feeling fixing the

272
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:24,807
game or, adding the
ClickHandler, right? You were

273
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:27,116
talking about staying close to
that feeling, which I, which is,

274
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:30,956
I turn a phrase that I love and
also something that I've sort of

275
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,407
un, you know, unintentionally or
intentionally sometimes try to

276
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,167
do, throughout my career. But
my, my question was going to be

277
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,297
like, how do you stay close to
that feeling when you're not,

278
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:42,642
when you're. Solving technical
computer problems anymore. Right.

279
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:46,422
How, like what, Like what are
ways that you can, that you do

280
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:48,761
stay close to that? Because I, I
imagine you do, but it's just a

281
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,591
little bit different. And so I
was wondering if you talk a

282
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:54,192
little bit about like how you,
or if you've thought about

283
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:56,231
that at all, how you stay close
to that

284
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:57,777
Ryan: I think it all the time
actually.

285
00:14:57,922 --> 00:14:58,412
Dan: Yeah.

286
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:02,756
Ryan: Well, for me it's the
concept, you know, there's a

287
00:15:02,756 --> 00:15:05,216
Buddhist teacher named Suzuki
Roshi who had a great phrase,

288
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:07,466
which is in the beginner's mind,
there are many possibilities, and

289
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:11,397
the experts mind. There are a
few. And so I, I just

290
00:15:11,397 --> 00:15:14,711
remember the beginner's mind. I
try to remember that. I don't

291
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:18,101
know, basically anything, you
know what I mean? Like you've had

292
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:21,552
experience with things, you've
seen some problems, but every

293
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:25,001
problem you solve is totally new.
It's, you know, it's like,

294
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:28,841
it's some new combination, some
new context, some new,

295
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:32,216
outcome you're trying to achieve.
Some new technologies. So I try

296
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:35,606
to stay close to beginner's mind
as much as I can by reminding

297
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:40,317
myself that I don't know, and,
going from that sort of area

298
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:44,096
of possibility rather than sort
of the preconceived notions. And

299
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:48,807
so in my current work, I try to
work with companies that. Want to

300
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:52,317
hire junior developers. I
think that's sort of the, I'd

301
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:55,076
rather work with companies that
are trying to integrate juniors

302
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:57,716
rather than companies that are
obsessed with, you know,

303
00:15:57,716 --> 00:16:01,106
seniority. And the reason for
that is that helps me stay close

304
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:05,067
to beginner's mind by working
with beginners. You see the

305
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:08,652
kind of endless possibilities in
their mind. As they create

306
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:11,682
sort of quote unquote bad code,
it's like, that's actually

307
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:14,142
creative code. It's creative
problem solving. It's not like

308
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:16,841
they're just wrote writing down
something they already know.

309
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:19,751
They're really trying to solve a
problem from a standpoint of

310
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:24,116
possibilities. And so, yeah, I
think working with beginners, Is

311
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,096
how I stay close to that feeling.
In addition to kind of

312
00:16:26,096 --> 00:16:29,126
cultivating it in my own mind, I
try to experience it through the

313
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:32,907
minds of actual, you know, you
know, beginners. So yeah, I

314
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:35,547
think that's, that's kind of the
answer is I, I try to stay close

315
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:38,397
to that feeling and then that
allows me that excitement when

316
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,976
other people solve problems when
it clicks for other people.

317
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:44,366
That's where like it clicks for
me too. You know, It's like I, I

318
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:46,496
don't know that I could do it. I
mean, I, you know, if I'm solving

319
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:49,496
a problem myself, some sort of,
you know, big scope problem as

320
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:51,897
you get when you're more
experienced, there's clicks for,

321
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:54,596
you know, it clicks for me too.
And I get that, that feeling of

322
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,966
like, Oh, it works, you know,
there's no errors. Or, you know,

323
00:16:56,966 --> 00:17:00,476
the type script compiler says, Go
ahead. You know, that's,

324
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:03,236
that's good stuff. But I do love
feeling it click or seeing it

325
00:17:03,236 --> 00:17:06,987
click beginners and kind of
experiencing that joy.

326
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:07,356
Second.

327
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:13,451
Dan: That's awesome. That's very
cool. Like being able to stay

328
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:15,791
close that feeling right by
sharing it with other people. You

329
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:19,362
know, I before I ask this
question. Yeah, yeah. Totally.

330
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:22,001
Totally. You know, and you had,
you had started talking about

331
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:26,711
how you like doing more one on
one, you know, pairing stuff like

332
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:29,261
that, with people, and I
imagine that's, it becomes a lot

333
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:32,771
easier to do that right. To.
Share in the experience when you,

334
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:36,852
when it's a more intimate, you
know, learning situation, right?

335
00:17:36,912 --> 00:17:39,461
With one, you know, one on one
sort of thing, instead of like

336
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,251
teaching a class, for instance.
To,

337
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:45,717
Ryan: Also I've found that.
Exactly. And also I've found

338
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:48,626
that, I mean this is an a d d
trait, but like if you tell me to

339
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:50,757
go off and do something, if I'm
not interested in it, I'm not

340
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:54,386
gonna do it And so like that's
why freelancing

341
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:54,761
Dan: about that.

342
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:58,977
Ryan: Yeah, exactly. So, you
know, it's, it's tough for me to

343
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:02,636
kind of do programming on my own.
And I've found that like if

344
00:18:02,636 --> 00:18:08,067
someone else holds the focus,
like pair programming or. If, if

345
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:10,616
it's something I can do in the
context of a meeting, you know,

346
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:13,977
like I just kind of go in, I do
the meeting, I come out, I go

347
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:17,096
back to my life. Like that is
actually where I do my best work,

348
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,557
is something I can do in
conversation, in, in, in

349
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,886
collaboration where someone else
holds the focus. I can do the

350
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:25,856
best work. But, so that's sort of
a another thing about knowing

351
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:30,146
myself, right? It's like knowing
where I work best and not trying

352
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:32,997
to like fit into someone else's
life as a, as a software

353
00:18:32,997 --> 00:18:36,416
developer, you know? So, and also
trying, it took me a long time to

354
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:40,656
kind of. Release myself from the
view I had of being a software

355
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:45,037
developer, cuz it was such a part
of my identity. And so it's,

356
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:47,616
it's tough like to say, like, you
know, to give that up to say, you

357
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:51,096
know, I don't wanna be a software
developer so much anymore, as

358
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,436
much as I wanna help other
software developers. Like that's

359
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:57,696
a, it was a mind bending thing,
you know? Cause I was so used to

360
00:18:57,696 --> 00:19:00,126
seeing, you know, to to telling
people I was a software engineer.

361
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:03,277
I still do sometimes cause it's
much easier than explaining what

362
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:05,436
I try to do. You know, if I don't
really wanna have the

363
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,916
conversation, if it's just.
Somebody doesn't know the

364
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,707
difference anyway. I'll just
say, Oh, I'm a software engineer,

365
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:13,436
but it's still true. I do a lot
of engineering on my own, but

366
00:19:13,856 --> 00:19:16,317
yeah, pair programming, things I
can do in conversation is where I

367
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:16,916
really shine.

368
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:20,981
Bekah: So when you're working
with teams, how do you kind of

369
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:25,481
transfer that same energy to
teaching within a team, or what

370
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:28,662
do you think the role is and how
that's translated from your

371
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:30,031
experience to what you're doing
now?

372
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:33,146
Ryan: Well, I mean, first you
have to know the team, right? You

373
00:19:33,146 --> 00:19:35,186
have to kind of know what their
individual problems are. You have

374
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:38,126
to talk to them. And so, you
know, I, I start with like an

375
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:41,906
audit where I go in and kind of
identify the pain points for

376
00:19:41,906 --> 00:19:45,281
people so that way when I go pair
with people, I know them and I

377
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:48,132
know the kind of what they're
working on. I know where they're

378
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:52,422
struggling. So yeah, I think
that, yeah, knowing, knowing

379
00:19:52,422 --> 00:19:54,701
people, knowing the people on the
team is kind of the most

380
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:57,221
important thing. And being
personal, you know, I don't,

381
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:00,162
I'm not writing a book, right.
I'm not writing a book on how to

382
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:02,501
solve all the problems. If I was
doing that, I mean, that would be

383
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:04,811
great too. But it's like I'm
really creating an

384
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:09,146
individualized. Plan for people
and companies as well. You know,

385
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:11,547
there's a plan for the team.
There's also a plan for

386
00:20:11,547 --> 00:20:15,176
individual pe, individual people
for how to improve, how to,

387
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:18,477
to do better. So yeah, I
think I've actually forgot what

388
00:20:18,477 --> 00:20:21,086
the, what the feeling was you
were asking about, but I think

389
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:23,727
that's sort of maybe an answer. I
mean, if you, if you have a

390
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:26,636
follow up, I mean, maybe I can
get back on track, but that was

391
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:27,717
the first thing that came to
mind.

392
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:32,696
Bekah: Yeah. Well, I mean, it's a
hard balance transitioning from

393
00:20:32,696 --> 00:20:37,497
doing like one on one mentorship
and teaching to going inside of a

394
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:40,707
team. And I think that idea of
getting to know people is super

395
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:45,957
important because I, I think that
you can be way more effective as

396
00:20:45,957 --> 00:20:50,156
a teacher if you do know the
people in front of you.

397
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:54,842
Because like I, I think. So much
of the time we depersonalize what

398
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:58,711
we're doing or we abstract these
concepts out and try to apply

399
00:20:58,711 --> 00:21:02,342
them rather than like recognizing
like there's a dynamic group of

400
00:21:02,342 --> 00:21:05,582
people in front of us and this
approach is not going to work

401
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:09,211
unless you have an understanding
of who those human beings are.

402
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:13,007
And I think that's, You know,
having those conversations and

403
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:16,186
the, like we do in Virtual Coffee
and the breakout rooms makes a

404
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:20,267
big difference. And there there
can be a real balance of like

405
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:25,727
trying to have that personal
experience and having empathy and

406
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:30,287
then also teaching in that
situation. So do you have any

407
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:33,136
strategies for being able to
balance those?

408
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:37,317
Ryan: Well, you know, I, I think
there's, I have sort of a view on

409
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:39,297
learning. I mean, I have a lot of
soundbites, right, that I say

410
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:43,436
over and over again. But, you
know, my view on learning is

411
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:46,932
that, And knowledge is that it's,
there's nobody has the same

412
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:50,382
knowledge. We all think that
like, Oh, I learned react, you

413
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:54,251
know, react like we know the same
thing, right? But actually, you

414
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:57,402
know, the way we really learn is
by connecting to our experience.

415
00:21:57,761 --> 00:22:00,551
We have all these analogies that
are personal, that we use to kind

416
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:04,061
of identify and understand
problems, understand solutions,

417
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:07,301
understand technologies, and so
it's really like a 3D space where

418
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:09,852
nobody really overlaps. It's like
you have this sort of bubble of

419
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:14,471
knowledge in the, in the problem.
And it's very multidimensional.

420
00:22:14,477 --> 00:22:16,932
It doesn't overlap with other
people. It's centered around you.

421
00:22:17,622 --> 00:22:19,692
And so I think when you're
working with a team, it's like

422
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:22,662
you have to kinda understand that
a team is a collection of

423
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:26,531
individuals who have common
goals. It's not like a unit,

424
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:28,721
like you know, in the military or
something where everybody just

425
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:31,031
sort of like follows an, I mean,
I don't know, I never in the

426
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:34,511
military, but you know, it's like
that software team is very much

427
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:37,632
like individual people tackling
problems individually. And I

428
00:22:37,632 --> 00:22:41,846
think that the other thing.
Trying to break that cycle and

429
00:22:41,846 --> 00:22:44,517
improve kind of pairing and
knowledge sharing between the

430
00:22:44,517 --> 00:22:47,336
team. Because a lot of times, I
mean, teams, these teams I've

431
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:50,817
been on, it's like you come in
and people are individually

432
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:52,886
working on problems, your
individual productivity,

433
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:56,396
everybody's trying to burn down
their sprint points. And you

434
00:22:56,402 --> 00:22:58,406
know, there's not like a lot of,
you know, some people will come

435
00:22:58,406 --> 00:23:00,267
up and ask a question
occasionally, but there's not.

436
00:23:00,957 --> 00:23:03,957
Teams working together. And so I
think the, the ultimate thing is

437
00:23:03,957 --> 00:23:07,017
I don't wanna be there long term,
you know, I'm not there to like

438
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:09,807
be the teacher forever. I, my, my
goal is to change the team

439
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:13,047
dynamic to make everybody a
teacher, you know, make everybody

440
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:17,186
sort of a learner and everybody a
mentor. You know, not obviously

441
00:23:17,186 --> 00:23:19,767
people have different capacities
and interests in it, but you

442
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:22,166
know, just improving their
ability to do it in their own

443
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:25,346
way. I think is kind of, I
think that answers your question.

444
00:23:25,346 --> 00:23:27,987
I always get off on these
tangents, but I think that's sort

445
00:23:27,987 --> 00:23:31,977
of how I approach. The team
dynamic is really trying to make

446
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:36,507
myself irrelevant. make myself
not necessary in the long term.

447
00:23:36,777 --> 00:23:38,876
Cuz again, I wanna work in
limited engagements. It's again,

448
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:42,086
an a, d, D thing. I'm not trying
to make a year contract with

449
00:23:42,092 --> 00:23:45,086
somebody where I'm just like
constantly grinding with them.

450
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:48,567
It's like, no, I wanna make them
better in a short term, in an

451
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:51,957
impactful way. Like do the, do
the judo move where you just sort

452
00:23:51,957 --> 00:23:56,126
of like come in and flip things
around and leave, you know,

453
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:59,846
that's kind of my ultimate. Is
not to, not to be, to make people

454
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:02,067
dependent on you, to make people
self-sufficient

455
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:06,146
Bekah: I think that's great and I
think that one of the biggest

456
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:13,616
things that I see or hear in the
industry is it kind of takes a

457
00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:18,267
breaking point to bring somebody
in to rectify communication and

458
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:24,717
team. I don't know what the
right word is. What would

459
00:24:24,717 --> 00:24:25,436
you, what did you say?

460
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:26,906
Ryan: Dynamics.

461
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:30,537
Bekah: dynamics. You know, people
wait until there's a problem and

462
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:36,747
I feel like bringing someone in
very early on can reduce

463
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:43,436
miscommunications, burn out.
Problems that you see because you

464
00:24:43,436 --> 00:24:46,616
haven't spent that time
developing communication. And I

465
00:24:46,616 --> 00:24:49,287
don't know if this is
particularly a startup issue, but

466
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,586
like the whole move fast and
break things, I feel like there's

467
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:57,027
a lot lost in how we communicate
within teams and cross team

468
00:24:57,027 --> 00:25:00,957
communication. So like what? What
is your ideal situation to come

469
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:04,227
in? Would you like to come in
from the beginning or do you like

470
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:09,237
to come in and kind of like blow
people's minds by fixing their

471
00:25:09,237 --> 00:25:09,747
problem?

472
00:25:10,797 --> 00:25:13,136
Ryan: That's a good way to put
it. Yeah, I mean, a lot of the

473
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,076
things I offer are
counterintuitive, right? Like

474
00:25:16,076 --> 00:25:18,717
slowing down, like, you know, not
going, moving fast and breaking

475
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:22,047
things, but instead, you know,
allowing people the time and the,

476
00:25:22,106 --> 00:25:26,757
the ability to talk to each other
first, you know, and second,

477
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:29,936
create quality. But I will
say that there's the ideal

478
00:25:29,936 --> 00:25:33,176
situation there is sort of a size
of the company that makes sense.

479
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:37,632
I think that one thing people
kind of. Discount is that the

480
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:41,201
best practices for a very small
company are different than the

481
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:44,172
best practices for a large
company. You know, if you're like

482
00:25:44,172 --> 00:25:47,531
a small company and you're trying
to scale, you know you wanna get

483
00:25:47,531 --> 00:25:50,561
started first. You wanna create
an mvp, you wanna, And so the

484
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:53,142
best practices for doing that are
not necessarily focused on

485
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:56,951
quality as much as they are
vetting and validating your idea

486
00:25:57,521 --> 00:26:00,162
and validating that it has a
market and validating that people

487
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:05,337
want to use it. And that maybe
creates incentives that are. and

488
00:26:05,343 --> 00:26:07,797
if you're like a series a company
where you have maybe 10, 20

489
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:10,227
people and you have some
investment and you have some

490
00:26:10,227 --> 00:26:13,977
ability to take risks to improve
quality, right? So I think the

491
00:26:13,981 --> 00:26:17,247
ideal situation is a little
larger company. Also larger

492
00:26:17,251 --> 00:26:20,126
companies have the ability to
onboard juniors more. I think

493
00:26:20,126 --> 00:26:22,856
that, you know, it, it's tough
when you're a small company to

494
00:26:22,856 --> 00:26:26,426
have maybe one developer. Who you
know is a junior developer. I

495
00:26:26,426 --> 00:26:28,886
think it's probably great from a
standpoint to that junior

496
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:30,987
developer, they learned so much.
I've been in that situation where

497
00:26:30,987 --> 00:26:33,537
I'm the only front end developer
or something, and I was kind of

498
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:36,416
junior and I learned a lot, you
know, so I think it's great for

499
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,057
the person, but for the company,
maybe it's like they wanna move

500
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:42,057
faster, they wanna, they wanna
break things, but like they don't

501
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:45,116
wanna things to be broken
constantly. So yeah, you

502
00:26:45,116 --> 00:26:47,517
know, I think that the best
practices are different and the

503
00:26:47,517 --> 00:26:50,457
ideal situation is maybe a
slightly larger company where

504
00:26:50,457 --> 00:26:53,071
there is a team. The team is sort
of established. There's

505
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:56,342
investment and ability to take
risks. I would love to work

506
00:26:56,342 --> 00:26:58,561
with, you know, smaller companies
and work from the beginning.

507
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:01,922
Right. But that also is maybe
they may, may be a little more

508
00:27:01,926 --> 00:27:04,561
dependent on me, right? They
actually may wanna hire me as

509
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:06,632
like a senior developer, and
that's not really what I'm trying

510
00:27:06,636 --> 00:27:10,291
to do. I want to come in and like
have a team that I can work with

511
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:14,221
and kind of affect, especially a
junior team. So yeah, I think

512
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:16,172
that I would love to be there
from the beginning and help them

513
00:27:16,172 --> 00:27:18,541
build quality, but I'd rather be
there when they are ready to

514
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:23,906
build. Ready to, to have
those counterintuitive solutions.

515
00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:27,116
Like, hey, you know, slow down.
Don't when there's a, when

516
00:27:27,116 --> 00:27:29,906
there's tech debt, solve it right
away. Have everybody work on it.

517
00:27:29,906 --> 00:27:32,606
You know, things like this, which
are sort of like, not the

518
00:27:32,606 --> 00:27:35,217
incentives you usually have, you
know? Cuz the main thing is

519
00:27:35,217 --> 00:27:36,797
they've been trying things, like
you said, there's a problem

520
00:27:36,797 --> 00:27:41,126
right. The CTO is talking to the
ceo and the CEO is like, Hey,

521
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:44,096
you're not delivering on these
business needs. Your team is

522
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:48,926
making a qu product that lacks in
quality in our users notice, and

523
00:27:48,926 --> 00:27:51,567
you know, what's the problem that
you're, you can't affect these

524
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:54,537
things. That's kind of the, the
issue that I would come in and

525
00:27:54,537 --> 00:27:57,987
sort of solve is like when that
exists, and I think it exists in

526
00:27:57,987 --> 00:28:01,076
a lot of teams at different
times. But yeah, that's what

527
00:28:01,076 --> 00:28:04,047
I would say. It's like there is
an ideal size and an ideal

528
00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:07,376
problem to come in and solve and,
and not, companies are not really

529
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:10,257
ready for counterintuitive
solutions when they're,

530
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:13,227
everything's working fine. I
think they don't want to come in

531
00:28:13,227 --> 00:28:14,936
and like change things. They're
like, Oh, everything's working

532
00:28:14,936 --> 00:28:17,997
fine. But when there's a problem
it's like, try something

533
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:21,207
different. Try a different tact,
because that's how you're gonna

534
00:28:21,207 --> 00:28:21,896
find a solution.

535
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:27,703
Dan: know, we talked, Ryan had me
on his Twitter space. What was

536
00:28:27,703 --> 00:28:29,834
that last week? This week? I
don't know.

537
00:28:29,848 --> 00:28:31,439
Ryan: The past

538
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,644
Dan: Recently, And,

539
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:34,709
Ryan: not future,

540
00:28:34,723 --> 00:28:37,784
Dan: one of the things we talked
about was a lot was, was the

541
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:41,308
idea of technical debt. On teams.
Right. And, and that's like one

542
00:28:41,308 --> 00:28:45,749
of the, one of the, maybe one of
the problems that you are hoping

543
00:28:45,749 --> 00:28:48,479
to be able to help solve. Right.
With, with these teams. Could you

544
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:51,719
talk a little bit about what,
what technical debt is, you know,

545
00:28:51,723 --> 00:28:54,118
like what, what it means to you
when somebody says technical debt

546
00:28:54,118 --> 00:28:59,068
and what, and then, and then also
like, you know, how, how that can

547
00:28:59,068 --> 00:29:02,489
like negatively affect, a
team, you know, maybe even

548
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:03,838
without them knowing about.

549
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:06,088
Ryan: Well, I think there's
actually, it's important to say

550
00:29:06,088 --> 00:29:08,818
there's actually lots of
different kinds of debt. That are

551
00:29:08,818 --> 00:29:11,009
different than just, I mean, a
lot of people when they say

552
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:13,618
technical debt, they think of
some developer experience problem

553
00:29:14,098 --> 00:29:18,028
where it's like there's something
counterintuitive code. Some

554
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:20,969
feature, but you know, Excuse me.
There's actually multiple

555
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:24,808
different kinds of debt. There's
quality debt. Which is where

556
00:29:24,808 --> 00:29:27,959
you're building things kind of
let lack quality and you just

557
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:30,838
leave it that way. I did this
funny tweet where I had a bridge

558
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:33,328
that I built in like poly bridge.
I dunno if you know this game,

559
00:29:33,598 --> 00:29:35,669
but it has these gaps in the
bridge and like the truck goes

560
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:38,009
across it and the bridge flexes
around and I'm like, this is kind

561
00:29:38,013 --> 00:29:40,828
of how we built products. We
leave these gaps and we say, Oh,

562
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:43,558
the, the truck can get across the
bridge without the, the whole

563
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:47,249
thing being built, therefore it's
done. And so I think that's

564
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:50,429
sort of a quality problem, right?
So that's quality debt. There's

565
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:53,608
knowledge. Which is where the,
the, the product doesn't teach

566
00:29:53,608 --> 00:29:56,939
people how to use it, how to
develop on it rather. And I

567
00:29:56,939 --> 00:29:59,699
think that the ultimate sort of
product is one that teaches the

568
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:04,138
developers how to, how to, how to
create. Changes in it, right? How

569
00:30:04,138 --> 00:30:07,558
to extend it, how to modify it to
maintain it. If the product isn't

570
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:10,229
teaching people that, that's
knowledge debt, right? That's

571
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:12,598
sort of, And the team isn't
sharing the knowledge too, right?

572
00:30:12,598 --> 00:30:14,669
But, so it's kind of a
combination of sort of like

573
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:18,388
automated solutions and just
plain old interfacing with other

574
00:30:18,388 --> 00:30:22,558
people face to face or you know,
remotely or even asynchronously,

575
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:24,419
right? Cause there's lots of
different ways teams operate

576
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:27,479
these days. So that's knowledge
debt. There's tactical debt,

577
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:29,398
which is, you know, what we
talked about, sort of like.

578
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:34,318
Developer facing problems in the
code that make it hard to develop

579
00:30:34,318 --> 00:30:37,199
that, make it hard to implement
quality, hard to share knowledge.

580
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:41,009
And then there's, there's one
other one that I, I can't think

581
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:44,308
of right now, but yeah, it's,
there's, that's what I would say.

582
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:47,294
There's lot, there's other
different kinds of debt.

583
00:30:47,354 --> 00:30:49,574
Wuality debt, knowledge, debt,
technical debt. Well, you know,

584
00:30:49,574 --> 00:30:52,243
I'll think of it. It's just
funny. I should know it cuz it's

585
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:54,223
kind of something, I dunno if
it's something I came up with,

586
00:30:54,223 --> 00:30:57,163
but it's something I talk about a
lot. But there's different kinds

587
00:30:57,163 --> 00:31:01,064
of, oh, innovation debt.
That's it. So innovation debt is

588
00:31:01,064 --> 00:31:05,219
like, Is, things you wanna do
but you haven't done cuz you

589
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:08,128
can't do it for some reason. You
know, like, you wanna build this

590
00:31:08,128 --> 00:31:11,009
feature, you wanna implement this
big change, refactor the product,

591
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:13,469
but everything else is holding
you back. Right. So that's sort

592
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:16,739
of like there's a debt in the, in
the innovation you're trying to

593
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:19,439
do. So yeah, I think breaking it
down in different, into different

594
00:31:19,443 --> 00:31:22,739
kinds of debt, not just focusing
on calling it technical debt sort

595
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:26,074
of opens you up. To really affect
the problems that are holding you

596
00:31:26,074 --> 00:31:28,894
back, to affect the things that
are preventing you from

597
00:31:28,894 --> 00:31:31,983
delivering on that promise, like
I said, and quality right, and

598
00:31:31,983 --> 00:31:34,413
promise of timelines. Yeah.

599
00:31:35,219 --> 00:31:37,919
Bekah: I love how you break that
down. I think that that really

600
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,558
helps to better understand what,
what problems that you're facing,

601
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:47,338
and also to be able to
explain it to other people,

602
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:51,989
especially if you have junior
members who are, are just coming

603
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,929
into the industry and trying to
understand exactly what you mean

604
00:31:54,929 --> 00:32:00,449
by technical debt. I think. It
also can help people to better

605
00:32:00,449 --> 00:32:05,578
identify their problems by
looking at it in that way. So

606
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:09,209
I, I think that this kind of
touches on this idea of knowledge

607
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:13,858
sharing and how you do that in
teams. So, can you first

608
00:32:13,858 --> 00:32:17,878
define knowledge sharing for us?
And then maybe talk about where

609
00:32:17,878 --> 00:32:19,328
to start with that.

610
00:32:20,588 --> 00:32:23,469
Ryan: Yeah, I mean, I think it's,
you know, we have this

611
00:32:23,469 --> 00:32:26,338
problem of droughts these days.
Because of, you know, global

612
00:32:26,338 --> 00:32:29,159
warming and there's places that
have water, there's places that

613
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:31,259
don't have water, and how do you
irrigate? You know, how do you

614
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:33,838
get water from one place to
another so that everybody can

615
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:37,229
drink, everybody can grow crops.
Right? And that's sort of what I

616
00:32:37,229 --> 00:32:40,169
see knowledge sharing as is.
There's people that have the

617
00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:43,679
context, have the understanding,
and there's people that need that

618
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,068
understanding, that need that
context to affect their work. And

619
00:32:47,068 --> 00:32:49,118
it's like, how do you get the
water from one place to another?

620
00:32:50,124 --> 00:32:52,854
And, there's lots of
different ways to do it, right?

621
00:32:52,913 --> 00:32:55,104
There's, you know, documentation.
Cause the thing is, there's

622
00:32:55,134 --> 00:32:57,354
asynchronous and synchronous
knowledge sharing, right?

623
00:32:57,864 --> 00:32:59,903
Synchronous knowledge sharing is
what we're doing right now. We're

624
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:03,624
having a conversation in real
time. I'm telling you, you're

625
00:33:03,624 --> 00:33:07,513
asking me questions. I'm telling
you. Something logical. I

626
00:33:07,513 --> 00:33:09,403
wouldn't call it an answer,
right? Cuz there's lots of

627
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:11,804
different answers. But I'm
telling you personal answers

628
00:33:11,804 --> 00:33:14,443
about like how I think about
problems. So that's like

629
00:33:14,443 --> 00:33:16,663
synchronous knowledge sharing.
And I think that if you can do

630
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:19,844
that, that's kind of the best way
to do it. Yes, it costs two

631
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:23,203
people's time. Which is kind
of where people get caught up is

632
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:25,663
like, Oh, there's a big cost. You
know, like pairing, there's a big

633
00:33:25,663 --> 00:33:31,453
cost with meetings, you know,
or one on ones ideal. But you

634
00:33:31,453 --> 00:33:33,794
know, of course there's a cost,
but it's like there's a huge

635
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:36,854
benefit. It's not like two times,
two people is two times work, you

636
00:33:36,854 --> 00:33:40,364
know, and two times cost. It's
like, maybe it's two times cost,

637
00:33:40,368 --> 00:33:42,523
but it's like there's a
multiplication effect that

638
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:44,953
happens when people share
knowledge, both in terms of the,

639
00:33:44,953 --> 00:33:47,983
our ability to execute and also
their ability to build quality,

640
00:33:47,983 --> 00:33:50,653
right? Cuz they know the edge
cases, they know sort of the

641
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:54,614
context they need to create best
practices within the product. And

642
00:33:54,614 --> 00:33:56,413
then there's asynchronous
knowledge sharing, which is

643
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,693
around. It could be Slack, right?
It could just be that's async

644
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:02,213
sort of knowledge sharing.
There's also documentation,

645
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:05,394
right? I have a lot of ideas on
documentation and kind of how to

646
00:34:05,394 --> 00:34:09,503
affect it and make it sort of,
useful for people. But yeah,

647
00:34:09,503 --> 00:34:11,184
that's what I would say. That's
sort of knowledge sharing in a

648
00:34:11,184 --> 00:34:14,244
nutshell. It's like how do you
irrigate this knowledge between

649
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,514
different areas, the people that
have it, the people that need it,

650
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,603
and, doing it synchronously
and asynchronously and sort of

651
00:34:20,603 --> 00:34:22,914
like being aware of the
difference between.

652
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,619
Dan: I love that metaphor. No, it
makes, it makes a ton of sense.

653
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:27,668
I, you know,

654
00:34:28,298 --> 00:34:30,759
Ryan: I have a lot of water based
metaphors for programming.

655
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:33,429
Dan: water-based metaphors, All
right. I I'm, a big fan of, I'm a

656
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:35,648
big fan of, of Data's

657
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:36,969
Bekah: be a water bender.

658
00:34:37,688 --> 00:34:39,969
Ryan: No, I would be Bruce Lee.
Like, you know, if you put water

659
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:42,398
in a cup, it becomes the cup. You
put water in a bottle, it becomes

660
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,128
the bottle. That's sort of my
thinking of water is that it's

661
00:34:45,128 --> 00:34:49,478
like, it's flexible and I like, I
like that idea. It's a flexible.

662
00:34:51,443 --> 00:34:54,744
Dan: nevermind. I was just I was
gonna take this metaphor too far.

663
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:57,998
Ryan: No, well, you know, mean,
it's great metaphor, so

664
00:34:58,043 --> 00:34:59,903
Dan: Oh, I was trying to figure
out what, what, like Twitter

665
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:02,934
would be if you're, you know,
sharing if knowledge is, is

666
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:04,869
Ryan: Twitter is a rainstorm.

667
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:08,844
Dan: is a rainstorm or is like
you like your Twitter account,

668
00:35:08,844 --> 00:35:10,884
not you, but like a person's
Twitter account is like you

669
00:35:10,884 --> 00:35:12,773
standing there with a scorecard.
right.

670
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:14,469
Ryan: You're just, it's a fire
You're

671
00:35:14,498 --> 00:35:15,248
Dan: That's right.

672
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:16,418
Ryan: a, Into a chasm.

673
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:19,659
Dan: Right, right. Yeah. Maybe it
hits

674
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:21,893
Ryan: And sometimes it splashes
back at you, but that's, you

675
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:22,074
know,

676
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:22,389
Dan: right?

677
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,563
Ryan: that's about it. I don't
know. That's a good question.

678
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,998
Dan: I, I like, No, I mean, but,
but going back to like what you

679
00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:30,998
were saying before, the, the,
that metaphor of the, especially

680
00:35:31,148 --> 00:35:33,789
the, you started this with
the, concept of droughts.

681
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:37,869
Right. And, and I think, I
feel like that is a really

682
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:41,034
powerful part of this metaphor
is. You have these droughts,

683
00:35:41,034 --> 00:35:45,384
Right? And of knowledge and, and
yeah. Yeah. And the, the lake of

684
00:35:45,384 --> 00:35:47,784
knowledge, like you have the lake
sounds, This is

685
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:49,898
Ryan: A drought, nothing grows,
what I mean? Nothing is

686
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:52,014
Dan: Right, right, right. Yeah.
And

687
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,318
Ryan: People are, you know,

688
00:35:53,813 --> 00:35:54,173
Dan: I think

689
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:54,849
Ryan: thirsty.

690
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,773
Dan: yes, I think that's a great
way of thinking about it.

691
00:35:57,773 --> 00:35:58,103
It's,

692
00:35:58,268 --> 00:36:01,599
Ryan: Kim Kardashian is like
watering her lawn at 200,000

693
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,509
gallons. You know, It's like, no,
nobody else has the water. I

694
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:04,789
don't know

695
00:36:05,768 --> 00:36:08,978
Dan: Right. So that means she's
the senior developer who doesn't

696
00:36:08,978 --> 00:36:09,849
talk to anybody

697
00:36:09,898 --> 00:36:12,188
Ryan: exactly. I there are those
people right there

698
00:36:13,028 --> 00:36:14,289
Dan: absolutely. You know, and,

699
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:15,489
Ryan: knowledge Dragons,

700
00:36:15,818 --> 00:36:21,548
Dan: and talked about, Yeah, we,
we, we talked about, or you

701
00:36:21,548 --> 00:36:25,059
talked about, you know, Some
of this work being easier with

702
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,728
larger teams or whatever, things
like that. I feel like this

703
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:30,998
happens a lot more often with
smaller teams. Maybe not more

704
00:36:30,998 --> 00:36:33,518
often, but it is a harder solve
problem to solve, right? With a

705
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:38,498
smaller team. Especially like
long term. So I'm just talking

706
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:41,528
about myself here, So just like
talk about, but like, I've been

707
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:44,949
working on some of these, some of
these products for, like

708
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:50,034
your. I don't know. I've been
working on one client for over 10

709
00:36:50,034 --> 00:36:54,293
years. Right. And I have a ton of
knowledge just in my head about

710
00:36:54,293 --> 00:36:56,454
it. And, you know, I try to do
docs and stuff, but it's like

711
00:36:56,454 --> 00:36:59,213
small team, right? So that means
mostly me, you know, And then

712
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:02,543
sometimes, like Bekah worked with
me for a while and, and, and,

713
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:05,724
I have somebody else working with
me now, you know, and it's.

714
00:37:06,713 --> 00:37:09,414
There's all these, there's all,
there's like deserts right? Of,

715
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:12,653
of, of, of not knowledge, right?
I, you know, there's places where

716
00:37:12,653 --> 00:37:14,813
I've like, this is gonna be
confusing, so I'm gonna like,

717
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:17,123
write things down. But there's
other places where, you know,

718
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:19,974
either, well, for a million
different reasons, there's, you

719
00:37:19,978 --> 00:37:23,873
know, nothing, right? And, I
guess I don't really have a point

720
00:37:23,873 --> 00:37:26,273
other than it's hard. It's our
problem. It can be a very hard

721
00:37:26,273 --> 00:37:27,923
problem to solve for teams all
size.

722
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:31,418
Ryan: you know what? I would say
again, counterintuitive

723
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:35,949
solutions, right? My way of
keeping, my way of saying keep

724
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:39,699
docs up to date is don't try You
know, speaking of the water

725
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:42,009
metaphor, it's a point in time
thing. There's, Well, go ahead.

726
00:37:42,068 --> 00:37:42,398
What were you gonna

727
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,829
Dan: talk more. No, I was gonna
say, talk more about this. That

728
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:46,748
is, never heard somebody say that
before, so I wanna hear what you

729
00:37:46,824 --> 00:37:49,284
Ryan: Well, I think there's some
documentation that needs to be

730
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:52,373
sort of evergreen, right? Like
onboarding documentation. It sort

731
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:55,403
of needs to be evergreen. Read
means need to be evergreen. But I

732
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:58,673
think architectural documentation
with like diagrams and like how

733
00:37:58,673 --> 00:38:02,514
things work, I think it's, it's
so tough to kind of keep that up

734
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:05,603
to date because it's such a big
sort of problem. You know, like

735
00:38:05,603 --> 00:38:07,974
how does the whole thing work?
It's different from onboarding,

736
00:38:07,974 --> 00:38:10,463
which is like, how do you start
the thing you don't know. But,

737
00:38:10,463 --> 00:38:12,114
architectural, Go ahead.

738
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:14,469
Dan: Oh, I was just saying
totally. I was just

739
00:38:14,664 --> 00:38:17,244
Ryan: Oh yeah, exactly. Documenta
or, you know, architectural

740
00:38:17,244 --> 00:38:20,664
documentation is so tough to kind
of like take the whole product

741
00:38:20,668 --> 00:38:24,114
and put it, boil it down into a
little residue of knowledge. And

742
00:38:24,114 --> 00:38:26,483
so I think, you know, I really
like the idea of architectural

743
00:38:26,483 --> 00:38:30,143
decision records. Which is, I see
it like a blog. You know, you're

744
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:32,364
keeping a blog of like all the
changes you're making in the

745
00:38:32,364 --> 00:38:35,333
product and it's point in time.
You don't update it. It's just

746
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:38,333
like, this is the decision we
made. And then if you, you, I

747
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:40,614
think if you reference those in
the code, right, you know, you

748
00:38:40,614 --> 00:38:43,523
have some anchor comments or
something that like link to these

749
00:38:43,523 --> 00:38:46,583
different architectural records
and you know, the architectural

750
00:38:46,588 --> 00:38:50,434
records supersede each other.
They amend each other, they have

751
00:38:50,438 --> 00:38:52,623
linkages, sort of like hyper
text, right? It's like they're

752
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:55,474
all linked together. So it is
very much like a blog that you're

753
00:38:55,474 --> 00:38:57,903
keeping of the decisions you make
throughout the development of the

754
00:38:57,903 --> 00:39:01,023
product. And you're not trying to
like go in and create sort of an

755
00:39:01,023 --> 00:39:05,074
omnibus like book that's
constantly has new additions.

756
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:08,313
You're creating blog posts that
sort of like, you know, do the

757
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:11,804
point in time thing. And that's
much easier to. Approach,

758
00:39:11,804 --> 00:39:14,233
especially as a small team,
because you don't, you're not

759
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:16,664
like constantly going back and
trying to create evergreen, you

760
00:39:16,664 --> 00:39:19,184
know, an evergreen documentation.
You're just writing these blog

761
00:39:19,184 --> 00:39:22,304
posts and leaving it, you know,
as you go, as little breadcrumbs

762
00:39:22,304 --> 00:39:25,094
for someone to say, Oh, this is
how the product evolved. Also,

763
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:29,153
you have sort of knowledge about
how the product used to be. Which

764
00:39:29,153 --> 00:39:31,224
I think is also very important
because sometimes you wanna go

765
00:39:31,224 --> 00:39:34,373
back you know, sometimes you
wanna learn from the past, you

766
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:37,193
wanna learn from like how things
were done initially. And also

767
00:39:37,193 --> 00:39:40,193
it's just like, it explains
things in a way that maybe,

768
00:39:40,224 --> 00:39:43,643
just a present sort of evergreen
documentation wouldn't cuz you

769
00:39:43,643 --> 00:39:46,373
say like, Oh, this is why that
was done. There's so many times

770
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:48,773
when we go into a code base and
go, Oh my God, this is horrible.

771
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:52,398
I was just done this way. And the
truth is always a reason. There's

772
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:54,199
always a reason. I always try to
tell people that when they're

773
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:57,048
like, Oh, I got this legacy code
base, and it's like, it's the

774
00:39:57,048 --> 00:40:00,048
worst. Like I can't believe it.
Who are these bad developers?

775
00:40:00,048 --> 00:40:02,539
It's like, you know, they were
you just in the past working with

776
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:05,418
problems, know, they're not like
bad developers. It's just they're

777
00:40:05,418 --> 00:40:07,878
working on deadlines, they're
working on the context is

778
00:40:07,878 --> 00:40:10,639
different and so like, I think
knowing that having empathy for

779
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:13,938
those original sort of the
ancestors of the code base is

780
00:40:13,938 --> 00:40:16,954
sort of like important. And just,
that's kind of something you get

781
00:40:16,954 --> 00:40:20,014
from a decision record that you
wouldn't get from, you know, like

782
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,123
explanation of what, how things
are. And also it kind of, it

783
00:40:24,123 --> 00:40:26,793
shows sort of alternate solutions
that you might consider in the

784
00:40:26,793 --> 00:40:29,344
future. The decision record. If
you, if you look at the, the,

785
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,554
the, you know, the way they're
written, it sometimes talks about

786
00:40:32,554 --> 00:40:34,833
alternate paths that could have
been taken in the decision that

787
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:37,143
was made, and that could be
useful in the future. You might

788
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,974
say, Oh, you know, that's
actually a way we could go with

789
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:42,588
this based on the current
context. Let's go refactor. And

790
00:40:42,588 --> 00:40:46,128
it's also in the code. There's
context, you know, it's like,

791
00:40:46,188 --> 00:40:49,278
and I think documentation and
code is really the way to go,

792
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:52,309
for all things. Cuz I think it's
like when you separate it from

793
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:55,789
the code, you lose the context
of, you lose context. And I

794
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:58,548
think that's important to
understanding how things work.

795
00:40:58,548 --> 00:41:01,219
But yeah, that's kind of my
thinking again, counterintuitive

796
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:03,708
solutions. It's like, try
something different. There's a

797
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:05,898
thing called like o bleak
strategies where it's like, it's

798
00:41:05,898 --> 00:41:08,568
like you just have a card, you
pull it out and it says like,

799
00:41:09,188 --> 00:41:12,429
Dance around in a circle and like
that's how you like cultivate

800
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:15,639
your creativity. I think like
thinking differently and trying

801
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,338
different things than you would
normally do or are normally done

802
00:41:18,338 --> 00:41:21,248
in the industry is sort of an if,
even if it doesn't work, it tells

803
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:23,438
you something about how it might
work. You know, it's an

804
00:41:23,438 --> 00:41:26,438
experiment that you're testing
hypothesis and maybe it doesn't

805
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:29,228
work, but like you learn
something new in the process. So

806
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:32,228
I was a dog Yeah, that's what I,
that's what I think.

807
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:36,878
Dan: I love that I, this
architectural decision records,

808
00:41:36,938 --> 00:41:41,048
I was just looking it up.
I found a couple, I kind of found

809
00:41:41,048 --> 00:41:41,829
a couple blog

810
00:41:41,978 --> 00:41:43,989
Ryan: It's like adr GitHub dot. I
owe

811
00:41:44,228 --> 00:41:46,298
Dan: that's what I, Yeah, that's,
that's what I'm on right now.

812
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:49,509
And I, I like that concept a lot.
I like to, you know, it's, it

813
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:52,719
becomes, and I, you know, I have,
I have spoken about this before,

814
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,739
but I have ADHD too, right? And
it's like, the, the idea of

815
00:41:56,739 --> 00:42:00,443
like, Oh, okay, I need docs.
Right. This is like the thing

816
00:42:00,443 --> 00:42:02,244
that pops in my head, right?
Like, there's nothing here. I

817
00:42:02,244 --> 00:42:05,903
need docs. But then like what are
like, it's just such a huge thing

818
00:42:05,963 --> 00:42:08,934
to try to Like you said, it's
like writing a book almost, and

819
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:10,673
you know that like, I mean, and
then when you start thinking

820
00:42:10,673 --> 00:42:13,463
about it, you know it's going to
be out of date immediately and oh

821
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:16,943
my gosh. So now it's like huge
chunk of work to begin with. And

822
00:42:16,943 --> 00:42:21,054
then also huge annoying chunk of
works, like chunks of work,

823
00:42:21,114 --> 00:42:23,813
to keep it up to date. And it
just seems impossible in my head

824
00:42:23,813 --> 00:42:24,594
sometimes, you know?

825
00:42:24,818 --> 00:42:26,829
Ryan: Well, you know, when I
worked at Dropbox, just to be the

826
00:42:26,829 --> 00:42:31,958
things wild, we had librarians,
technical librarians who li I

827
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:32,469
mean literal

828
00:42:32,574 --> 00:42:32,934
Dan: like that

829
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:36,748
Bekah: I wanna be a technical
librarian. didn't know that was a

830
00:42:36,748 --> 00:42:37,259
thing.

831
00:42:38,048 --> 00:42:39,159
Ryan: can connect if you want.

832
00:42:39,384 --> 00:42:42,173
Dan: That sounds awesome. I
mean, like, that's the kind of

833
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:45,983
thing you, you the, once your
company grows in size, like, you

834
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:48,023
know, you can start having people
that have jobs of, you know,

835
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:50,873
specific jobs. Right. And smaller
teams, you have to do everything

836
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:54,983
right. And that's, that's a
very cool I wonder

837
00:42:55,179 --> 00:42:56,139
Ryan: you get, that's a big

838
00:42:56,244 --> 00:42:59,648
Dan: if there's like a
consulting. Technical librarians

839
00:42:59,648 --> 00:43:00,699
that can consult

840
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,199
Ryan: Well, there are technical
writer

841
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:03,429
Bekah: what I wanna do. I wanna

842
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:04,478
Dan: Yeah. I mean like

843
00:43:04,778 --> 00:43:05,289
Bekah: librarian.

844
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,338
Dan: Right, right, right. So,

845
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:08,768
Bekah: you put the books back in
the right order,

846
00:43:09,699 --> 00:43:10,539
Dan: Yeah, because like,

847
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,619
Bekah: miscategorized.

848
00:43:12,338 --> 00:43:14,259
Dan: Right. And then keeping it
up to date, like if you have

849
00:43:14,264 --> 00:43:17,048
somebody that is not a full-time
employee, Right. But somebody

850
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:21,969
who's like, all right, the first,
run through would be. big

851
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:24,009
project. Right. But like after
that, it's like maintenance

852
00:43:24,009 --> 00:43:26,679
stuff. Maybe a couple hours,
whatever, a week or a month, you

853
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:29,498
know, whatever it is. But like
that man. Alright. I have to

854
00:43:29,498 --> 00:43:29,918
think this.

855
00:43:30,054 --> 00:43:33,023
Ryan: No, I, I agree. It's, it's,
it's a, it's a huge task and

856
00:43:33,023 --> 00:43:36,833
so like having specialized people
is really valuable, but, you

857
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,483
know, also, but they're, they
don't necessarily have the

858
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:41,664
context, so they're just sort of,
Organizing, making sure things

859
00:43:41,664 --> 00:43:44,514
are formatted correctly, making
sure things are linked correctly.

860
00:43:44,844 --> 00:43:47,153
But you know, the knowledge has
to come sort of ultimately from

861
00:43:47,153 --> 00:43:49,344
the people who are on the you
know?

862
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:53,063
Dan: But, but if somebody's like,
and that this is like, you know,

863
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,583
speaking of something that I've
done that is not well documented,

864
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:58,253
whatever, but somebody asks me a
question about it, then I'm like,

865
00:43:58,463 --> 00:44:00,684
can talk about it for a while.
You know what I mean? But then,

866
00:44:01,224 --> 00:44:03,563
and you mentioned like, like
those async, you know, learning

867
00:44:03,563 --> 00:44:05,364
channels and stuff like that.
That's this kind of thing. And

868
00:44:05,364 --> 00:44:08,543
then, but then it gets buried in
a slack, you know, thread

869
00:44:08,548 --> 00:44:12,083
somewhere and disappears cuz
don't pay for slack you know, and

870
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:15,653
all that stuff. Right? And so,
Man, I, I like the idea of

871
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,173
having somebody, an outside
person plus like, if you see

872
00:44:18,173 --> 00:44:20,873
somebody do, I'm sorry I'm
talking about this so much, but

873
00:44:20,873 --> 00:44:24,204
I'm excited about it now, But if
you, if like, if me as, as like

874
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:26,693
the whatever lead developer on a
project and you have an outside

875
00:44:26,693 --> 00:44:30,233
person that comes and gets
something going or adds an

876
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:32,574
addition, you'll be able to like,
I would be able to like see if

877
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:35,003
it's wrong or needs some like,
not wrong, but, you know, need

878
00:44:35,003 --> 00:44:38,034
some like tweaks or whatever. And
that's an easier job than,

879
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:39,878
Ryan: Well, there's a value

880
00:44:39,893 --> 00:44:41,634
Dan: the, starting from the
beginning. Right.

881
00:44:41,858 --> 00:44:44,168
Ryan: It's a value to an external
perspective. That's what I always

882
00:44:44,168 --> 00:44:47,978
say about myself is like, you
know, you've tried things, you

883
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:51,548
have a context about how things
work. I can come in as with an

884
00:44:51,548 --> 00:44:54,458
external perspective and provide
additional value that you

885
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:57,608
otherwise wouldn't get. You know,
it's kind of like, I'm trying

886
00:44:57,608 --> 00:45:00,159
to think of an explanation. It's
cross pollination, you know what

887
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,119
I mean? It's like you're getting
sort of information or genetic

888
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:07,748
information from an external
source, and that creates a. Sort

889
00:45:07,748 --> 00:45:10,809
of, you know, better result if
you just kind of like, I don't

890
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:13,389
wanna get into like genetics, but
it's like, you know, you don't

891
00:45:13,389 --> 00:45:16,208
wanna just breed the same genes
over and over again. It creates

892
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:19,539
sort of problems. And so it's
like you need that external

893
00:45:19,748 --> 00:45:22,208
information, external
perspective. And, you know, I

894
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:24,099
think every company needs that.
And that's kind of what you get

895
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:26,949
when you hire people, right?
You're hiring someone, they come

896
00:45:26,949 --> 00:45:30,309
in with their own sort of
knowledge and abilities and,

897
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:32,708
but you know, if you can just,
you can also hire a consultant,

898
00:45:32,768 --> 00:45:35,228
you know, and, and they can
provide the same sort of thing on

899
00:45:35,228 --> 00:45:38,994
a more temporary sort. Basis and
less, you know, ultimately less

900
00:45:38,994 --> 00:45:42,114
cost. Right. You know, than
hiring somebody. But, over,

901
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,364
over, you know, if they come in
for three months and you cost

902
00:45:44,364 --> 00:45:47,844
this much, hiring someone for a
year and maybe not having them do

903
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:50,273
the same work is, you know, a
different, different calculus.

904
00:45:50,273 --> 00:45:52,583
But yeah, external perspectives
very valuable.

905
00:45:54,909 --> 00:45:58,764
Dan: I love that. You've given me
a lot to think about I mean,

906
00:45:59,094 --> 00:46:01,284
I'll, I'll Every time we, every
time

907
00:46:01,373 --> 00:46:02,693
Ryan: have talk about it some
more. Yeah.

908
00:46:03,054 --> 00:46:05,724
Dan: Yeah. I always, I always end
up coming away with a, with a lot

909
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:06,954
of stuff to think about all of.

910
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,563
Ryan: Yeah. Well, that's the
point, right? Is like, that's

911
00:46:09,563 --> 00:46:12,804
the, I have the external
perspective and you're learning

912
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:17,273
from it, and I'm learning from
yours. That's sort of the, the

913
00:46:17,278 --> 00:46:21,384
ultimate idea, right? Is like we
learn from each other. That's why

914
00:46:21,384 --> 00:46:24,534
we have conversations. It's not
to like, I'm not like telling you

915
00:46:24,534 --> 00:46:25,523
stuff. I wanna listen you.

916
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:32,784
Bekah: that's so important.
That idea of listening, cuz it's

917
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:38,364
hard to do and so much of the
time we spend listening to

918
00:46:38,364 --> 00:46:42,599
respond to other people rather
than. Just listening to

919
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:47,248
understand people, and I think
that's, it's a hard thing to do,

920
00:46:47,248 --> 00:46:53,039
but it's a good habit to work on
in, in any situation, but

921
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:57,539
especially if you're on a team of
diverse people or I, I think too,

922
00:46:57,653 --> 00:47:01,244
Ryan: Well, hopefully you are
Yeah. I think that listening it

923
00:47:01,273 --> 00:47:04,393
requires empathy, right? But it,
it's more than that. I think it,

924
00:47:04,423 --> 00:47:06,673
because empathy comes from
letting go of yourself.

925
00:47:06,778 --> 00:47:07,389
Bekah: mm-hmm.

926
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,463
Ryan: If you come into a
listening situation without

927
00:47:09,463 --> 00:47:12,554
compassion, which is literally
just like not putting yourself in

928
00:47:12,554 --> 00:47:14,503
the other person's shoes, but
just not even, just not even

929
00:47:14,503 --> 00:47:17,293
really imagining, you know what I
mean? You just kind of let go of

930
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:21,434
your own preconceived notions and
listen to the person, and then

931
00:47:21,434 --> 00:47:23,764
when they're done, you come out
of it and try to integrate it.

932
00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:26,059
Then you can come up with some
advice. But if you're sitting

933
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:28,369
there in your head sort of
calculating like, Oh, this is my

934
00:47:28,369 --> 00:47:31,338
answer. This is my answer, this
is how I think about it, this is

935
00:47:31,338 --> 00:47:34,639
how you know. Then you're not
really listening. You're like, I

936
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:36,289
don't know what it is, but you're
not listening. You know?

937
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:40,248
Listening is really like letting
go of yourself for a moment

938
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:43,818
completely as much as possible,
and just being present with the

939
00:47:43,978 --> 00:47:46,664
other person. And really like
trying to, That's how empathy

940
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:49,603
comes, is not from like relating
it to your experience, your own

941
00:47:49,603 --> 00:47:53,653
sort of hurts and desires and you
know, suffering or whatever you

942
00:47:53,653 --> 00:47:56,264
wanna put it, you know, in the
Buddhist sense I would say. But

943
00:47:56,268 --> 00:47:59,114
yeah, you know, it's really just
kind of listening and being there

944
00:47:59,114 --> 00:48:02,264
for the other person and then
after they're done you come back

945
00:48:02,264 --> 00:48:05,023
and you go, wow, you know, I
really learn from that

946
00:48:05,023 --> 00:48:07,784
perspective, you know, cuz it's
ultimately listening is learning,

947
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:10,664
right? And the way you learn is
not by, is by integrating, but

948
00:48:10,664 --> 00:48:14,309
first sort of, you know,
transporting yourself to. Another

949
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:15,809
way of being, another
perspective.

950
00:48:17,804 --> 00:48:21,014
Bekah: Yeah. I love that. Well,
Ryan, it's about time for us to

951
00:48:21,014 --> 00:48:26,653
wrap up. Is there one tip that
you can leave our listeners with

952
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:31,603
to help them get started and this
idea of build. Better teams

953
00:48:31,603 --> 00:48:34,543
through, empathy and
listening.

954
00:48:35,969 --> 00:48:40,574
Ryan: Wow. That's a good
question. I think it's being,

955
00:48:40,574 --> 00:48:43,273
you know, compassion is very
important. There's a big push

956
00:48:43,273 --> 00:48:46,873
these days for compassionate
coding, for compassionate teams.

957
00:48:47,353 --> 00:48:49,903
And you know, I've been on some
teams as well that just don't,

958
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:53,474
there's some lack of disconnected
compassion, you know, And so

959
00:48:53,474 --> 00:48:57,014
being gentle with each other,
being empathetic, as you said, is

960
00:48:57,014 --> 00:49:03,119
such an important skill and such
an important you. Component of

961
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,599
being a team. That listing aspect
of really kind of letting go of

962
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:10,378
yourself and connecting with
another person is, you know, and

963
00:49:10,378 --> 00:49:12,809
then, and then sharing knowledge,
you know, is like, that's, that's

964
00:49:12,813 --> 00:49:15,208
the, the basis of sharing
knowledge is connecting with the

965
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:18,148
other person's experience. You're
just talking at them and saying,

966
00:49:18,153 --> 00:49:21,539
Read the docs. You know, like
that's not how you connect with a

967
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:24,568
person and connect because
ultimately knowledge, as I said,

968
00:49:24,568 --> 00:49:28,523
is like about connecting. Some
sort of theory to your personal

969
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:31,554
experience. You know, that's how
you transfer knowledge is, I tell

970
00:49:31,554 --> 00:49:34,798
you, this is my experience. Or
you tell me first. I think you

971
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:37,648
have to ask questions first. You
know, ask questions first and

972
00:49:37,648 --> 00:49:40,559
listen, and you say, This is my
experience. Then I go, Oh, you

973
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,228
know, based on what I think, this
is how I might connect with what

974
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:45,659
you said, This is how I might
connect with you as a person.

975
00:49:46,139 --> 00:49:48,239
See, I don't know if that makes
sense to your question, but

976
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:50,398
that's what I would say is being
gentle, being compassionate

977
00:49:50,403 --> 00:49:54,708
first. Not trying to just kind of
grind people, you know, cuz

978
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:57,739
that's really how you lose your
team. It's how you lose kind of

979
00:49:57,739 --> 00:50:00,259
the knowledge that people have
when they leave is you burn them

980
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:02,509
out and you're not being
compassionate. And I think it's

981
00:50:02,509 --> 00:50:05,478
so tough on a corporate level to
be compassionate cuz there's the

982
00:50:05,483 --> 00:50:08,418
profit, motive, and business
needs and all this stuff. But if

983
00:50:08,418 --> 00:50:11,059
you can really kind of let that
go and say, Look, we're gonna

984
00:50:11,059 --> 00:50:13,909
care about our people first, that
will reap the rewards you.

985
00:50:14,173 --> 00:50:17,054
That'll reap the rewards more
than like, you know, burning

986
00:50:17,054 --> 00:50:19,244
people out for a business end,
you know what I mean? Like,

987
00:50:19,244 --> 00:50:22,423
there's more to life. You're a
person too. The CEO's a person,

988
00:50:22,423 --> 00:50:24,164
you know, they don't want to,
they wanna go golfing or

989
00:50:24,164 --> 00:50:26,623
whatever. They don't wanna like,
you know, just be burning

990
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:30,193
themselves out and, you know, to
like, to, to, to make money. I

991
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,614
think ultimately maybe they do,
but that's sort of my opinion, is

992
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:36,253
like, you wanna build a great
team, be compassionate and play

993
00:50:36,253 --> 00:50:38,474
golf, I guess, you know, let them
play golf. I don't know whether

994
00:50:38,474 --> 00:50:41,934
they were, they. I play disc
golf, but, you know, let people

995
00:50:41,934 --> 00:50:44,213
be themselves. And I think
that's, you also have to accept

996
00:50:44,213 --> 00:50:46,974
that people don't work the same
hours, People don't have the same

997
00:50:46,974 --> 00:50:49,103
accommodations. Like that's
where, that's where compassion

998
00:50:49,103 --> 00:50:52,074
comes in is like understanding
the diversity of people and

999
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:54,443
trying to make them productive
and not trying to put them on a

1000
00:50:54,443 --> 00:50:57,773
clock. And like, like where, you
know, in the Henry Ford factory,

1001
00:50:58,193 --> 00:51:00,563
it's creative work. You
really need to kind of disconnect

1002
00:51:00,563 --> 00:51:04,074
from that idea of like, you know,
hours and time and productivity.

1003
00:51:06,409 --> 00:51:09,384
Bekah: was a great way to end the
episode. Thank you so much, Ryan.

1004
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,188
Dan: Thanks, Ryan. Thanks for.

1005
00:51:11,994 --> 00:51:13,733

wonderful to talk to you both the

1006
00:51:13,733 --> 00:51:16,704
two people I really respect and
have great connection with and

1007
00:51:16,704 --> 00:51:19,313
it's so nice to be able to spend
time with you and you know, I

1008
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:21,713
guess record it, but just to
spend you is really

1009
00:51:21,728 --> 00:51:22,148
Bekah: Yeah.

1010
00:51:22,628 --> 00:51:25,478
