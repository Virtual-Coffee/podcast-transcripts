00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,109
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 6, Episode 2

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,018
of the

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,574
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

4
00:00:12,574 --> 00:00:15,129
that

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,789
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

6
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:20,334
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

7
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:21,879
their

8
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,334
coding journey. And they're
here, on this podcast, sharing

9
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:24,789
their

10
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,304
stories and what they've
learned. And we are here to

11
00:00:26,304 --> 00:00:27,819
share it with

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,359
you. Here with me today is my
co-host, Dan.

13
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,299
Dan Ott: Hello! How is it going,
Bekah?

14
00:00:34,914 --> 00:00:36,994
Bekah: It is going fabulous.

15
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:39,465
Dan: That's so much less
satisfying to say than, 'Waddup,

16
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:41,000
Bek.' [Bekah laughs] I think I'm
just gonna start saying that in

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,664
every episode [laughs].

18
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:43,884
Bekah: Fine. It's fine. That's
cool.

19
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:49,314
Dan: Anyway, yes. Today we have
another, you know,

20
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:51,984
awesome, obviously, guest.
Bogdan --

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Bekah: The theme- theme for-

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Dan: Yes.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,325
Bekah: -Season 6 is awesomeness.

24
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:56,000
Dan: Yes. And really, for all
seasons, honestly.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Bekah: Every [humming].

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,677
Dan: But yeah, we have Bogdan
Covrig here. He is a software

27
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:03,354
developer from

28
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,874
The Netherlands, and he ... I
don't know. Yeah, he- he -- it

29
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:08,394
was really

30
00:01:08,394 --> 00:01:11,754
great to have him on. He- he
just finished school, like last

31
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:14,754
year, sometime, right? Or this
year? Last year? I don't know.

32
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:15,265
Recently. In ... The ... Nether-
... lands --

33
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,319
Bekah: Time has not exist over
the last two years. So --

34
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:21,715
Dan: No. Yeah. Yeah. No, I have
no idea. But he talks

35
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,424
about that. He talks about
experience in school, go

36
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:27,055
through school, and- and then,
you know, his experiences as

37
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:28,480
developer, and it was really
fun. Really- really good talking

38
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,905
to him.

39
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:34,105
Bekah: It's always interesting
to think about the journeys that

40
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:38,694
people take to get them to the
roles that they're in. And so I

41
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:42,295
think Bogdan is one of the first
people, or one of the few people

42
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:47,140
that we've talked to who's been
an educator, as in like, in a

43
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,000
university setting, teaching
people about coding. And-

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Dan: Yeah.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,005
Bekah: -to hear what that was
like and what he learned from

46
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:57,010
that experience that

47
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:57,760
brought him to where he is right
now.

48
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:01,509
Dan: Yeah, totally. I mean, I
was very curious to hear about

49
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:02,514
that.

50
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:04,825
And I did some computer science
in s- in-in school, and in

51
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:07,135
college,

52
00:02:07,704 --> 00:02:11,425
and it was a long time ago. And
... I don't know, I was curious

53
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:12,850
to see -- hear about -- I'm also
just curious to hear about what

54
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,275
it's

55
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:17,830
like in a classroom right now as
a developer, as, you know, in a-

56
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,494
in a college classroom, as
opposed to bootcamps, and things

57
00:02:19,494 --> 00:02:21,158
like

58
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:26,349
that. And ... yeah. And- and
also, I don't know. The idea of

59
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,870
teaching is just like so beyond
anything I've ever done, like,

60
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,479
you know, teaching at semesters
of worth of classes, you know?

61
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:33,909
I -- although, I don't know. I
was curious about it and so it

62
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:35,559
was really nice to

63
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,159
hear about it from- from- from
Bogdan.

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,160
Bekah: Yeah. And to hear the
process that he went through as

65
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,240
he was

66
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,919
trying to figure out like what's
next for him in his career path.

67
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,710
And we start every episode of
this podcast like we start every

68
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,800
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

69
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,180
we're from, what we do, and a
random check-in question. So, we

70
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:09,955
hope you enjoy this episode.
Today's random check-in question

71
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:15,955
is, what is your favorite
condiment? My name is Bekah. I'm

72
00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:20,846
a technical community builder,
and my favorite condiment is hot

73
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,885
sauce. Definitely. That goes on
everything.

74
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:28,945
Dan: That's a good one. Yeah.
All right. Hi, I'm Dan. I do web

75
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:33,586
development in Cleveland. I- I
don't have a super favorite.

76
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:36,851
I- I'd say -- so there's this
taco place in ... near where I

77
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,836
live,

78
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:44,366
called ... what -- Bombas. And
they -- so when you

79
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:46,076
could -- they have this, like,
sauce. And you can -- when you

80
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:47,786
order like

81
00:03:47,786 --> 00:03:50,545
a taco box to go, you know, like
this, like a family box or

82
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:53,605
whatever, they'll give you just
like a whole- like a whole thing

83
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:55,000
of it. A whole like bottle of
it.

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Bekah: Yes.

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Dan: And I -- when we do that,
I- I use it for like the next

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,001
two weeks and -- on the, like,
everything. So I- I

87
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:02,518
can't really describe it. I
think -- it has garlic in it,

88
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:03,625
certainly. I

89
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:06,566
don't -- it maybe some sort of
aioli maybe? I don't- I don't

90
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:08,725
actually know, and I don't
really wa-

91
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:09,596
Bekah: Is it spicy? No, it's not
spicy.

92
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,000
Dan: No, it's not- it's not
spicy.

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,500
Bekah: Creamy?

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Dan: You kn- yeah, it's a little
creamy, I guess. Although saying

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,380
creamy makes it sound weird
[chuckles]. I dunno [laughs].

96
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,440
But- but it's good. And I, like,
I don't wanna know really. I

97
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,789
like

98
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,990
the mystery of it, you know what
I mean? It's just like this

99
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,190
magical thing that

100
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,800
shows up, and then it goes away,
and then a couple months later

101
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:29,380+
we'll order, you know, those
tacos again, and it'll be back to

102
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:32,531
my life. I don't wanna have the
mys- like, maybe it's just

103
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:35,471
some chunky thing that they buy
off -- it probably is [chuckles]

104
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:37,690
something that I could just buy
at the grocery store, you know?

105
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:38,680
But I don't wanna know. It was
--

106
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,485
Bekah: Is it like mayonnaise-y?

107
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:43,240
Dan: I don't know. It's --

108
00:04:43,255 --> 00:04:44,185
Bekah: Does it need
refrigerated?

109
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:44,831
Bogdan Covrig: Meal [chuckles].

110
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:46,090
Dan: I mean, I put it in the
refrigerator. I don't -- I

111
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,349
assume.

112
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,345
I don't- I don't ... I don't
know. Why would you have an open

113
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:51,340
bottle of

114
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:53,290
some sort of sauce that you
didn't put in the refrigerator?

115
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:55,615
Bekah: Hot sauce doesn't go in
the refrigerator.

116
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,040
Dan: It doesn't? We keep ours --

117
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:58,286
Bogdan: Some do. I feel like
some do, right?

118
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:00,000
Dan: Yeah. I don't- I don't
know. Well, like-

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Bekah: You need it to hide --

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,471
Dan: -Tabasco. Do you put
Tabasco in the --

121
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:04,000
Bekah: No. I don't think it
needs to be-

122
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,000
Bogdan: I do [??].

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Dan: Really?

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,867
Bekah: -there's a lot of vinegar
in it and that doesn't need to

125
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:07,734
be refrigerated.

126
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:09,460
Dan: Huh. We had these
refrigerator talks before. I- I

127
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,555
don't know the

128
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:12,685
rules. So I just assume
everything goes in because it

129
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:13,646
seems safer to me [Bogdan
chuckles]-

130
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:15,415
Bekah: Tomatoes do not go in the
refrigerator. They still do not.

131
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:16,745
Dan: -you know? Right. This is
what I'm saying. I don't -- I- I

132
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:18,044
know -- I- I

133
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,073
don't have the knowledge to
argue with you about it. But I

134
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:20,096
just put

135
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:22,346
things in the fridge because
that always seems like the safer

136
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:24,026
option, you know what I mean? To
me.

137
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,831
Bogdan: Do you- do you put your
oil in the fridge?

138
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:27,805
Dan: No!

139
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:27,805
Bekah: No!

140
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:28,391
Bogdan: Yeah. That would be
weird.

141
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:29,538
Dan: No, no. All right. Yeah,
that- that'd be weird. I

142
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,045
actually had a

143
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:35,485
friend ... Emily's brother
actually, like, got in

144
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:37,435
the habit of keeping his cereal,
like in the fridge. Because he-

145
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:39,385
he

146
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:41,171
said it- it kept it -- like, it
would not go stale as- as fast,

147
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:42,956
you know?

148
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:43,000
It would stay fresh longer.

149
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Bekah: How long do you keep this
cereal [chuckles]?

150
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Dan: I don't know. I mean, he's
just like liv- living alone, you

151
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
know?

152
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,115
And like ... I don't know. But
like, we went on

153
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,617
vacation altogether at this
little cottage with this tiny

154
00:05:52,617 --> 00:05:54,114
fridge, and

155
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:55,975
the whole f-fridge was full of
cereal [laughs]. We were like,

156
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:57,835
"No, no. This

157
00:05:57,836 --> 00:05:59,530
is not like -- this is not a --
this is not -- we're putting

158
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,224
this in the

159
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:04,188
cabinet." That's where I draw
the line. Cereal ... doesn't go

160
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:07,151
in the fridge.

161
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:07,735
Bekah: That's -- I'm glad
[chuckles] you draw the line

162
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,415
there.

163
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:12,281
Dan: Oil? Yeah, yeah -- no. I- I
knew -- I know enough not to put

164
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:16,091
oil in the fridge. Other than
that ... I'll put things in the

165
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:17,396
fridge, and then sometimes Emily
will say, "Hey, that doesn't go

166
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:18,701
in

167
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:20,620
the fridge, dummy." And I'm
like, "Okay [chuckles]. Fair

168
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,539
enough." But this

169
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,725
sauce, I don't wanna know
whether it does or not, you know

170
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:24,910
what I

171
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:26,620
mean? Cuz I don't wanna know
anything about it. That's my

172
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,180
point. So I'm just putting it in
the fridge.

173
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:29,935
Bekah: You don't wanna know
about it. That's weird.

174
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:32,711
Dan: Hey, it's a mystery. No, I
like it. I like -- it tastes-

175
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Bekah: I don't like the dressing
[??].

176
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:34,855
Dan: -very good. I feel like if
I learn about it, something will

177
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:36,999
-- it'll

178
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,680
become ... less good [laughs].

179
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:41,124
Bogdan: Or you'll be- be
disgusted by it.

180
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Bekah: Alright, Bogdan [laughs]
--

181
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,338
Dan: But, I mean, that is- that
is a very serious -- that, I

182
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:45,537
mean, that

183
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:47,000
is an actual possibility too. I
don't- I don't want that to-

184
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,509
to happen either [laughs].
Alright, I'm done.

185
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:55,588
Bogdan: Okay. Hello, everybody.
I am Bogdan. I'm from

186
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:57,793
Romania, but I am a software
engineer in The Netherlands.

187
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,998
I've

188
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:03,869
been living here for almost five
years, moved from a tiny city in

189
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:05,806
Romania to a tiny [chuckles]
city in The Netherlands. And I

190
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:07,738
like it.

191
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:13,053
And I don't wanna leave. And I
think -- are we talking about

192
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:15,084
sauces -- sauce or condiments?

193
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:20,848
Bekah: Well, I considers some
sauce as a condiment, so --

194
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:21,238
Bogdan: Okay.

195
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:21,704
Dan: Oh, oh, like, wait, wait.
Pasta- pasta sauces are not

196
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:22,139
condiment, right?

197
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:23,399
Bogdan: No, no, no. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. I get it.

198
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:25,439
Bekah: Yeah. Pasta sauce, it
doesn't count --

199
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:27,958
Bogdan: No, no, no, I get it. I
was just -- yeah. Cuz one of the

200
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,727
best

201
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:33,119
thing that I discovered and ch-
absolutely changed my life, my

202
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:38,084
friends got me like this jar of
Chipotle pepper or whatever.

203
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:41,053
I don't know how it works. I
don't know how -- i-i-it's just

204
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:43,078
amazing. Cuz then I put it in
absolutely [chuckles]

205
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:45,103
everything.

206
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:46,000
I mean, not everything.

207
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Dan: Nice.

208
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:48,266
Bogdan: Ev- like everything that
goes with like tomato sauce or

209
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:48,999
tomatoes, I just-

210
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Dan: Yeah.

211
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,502
Bogdan: -pour some of those and
it's just amazing. Like the

212
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:55,004
smokey, everything.

213
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:56,264
So, yeah. But otherwise, it's
got -- like, usually it's got --

214
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:57,524
like garlic goes into

215
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:59,653
everything, and then --

216
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,033
Dan: I mean, garlic's delicious.
Yeah.

217
00:08:01,244 --> 00:08:03,793
Bogdan: Yeah. And smoked paprika
also. Like, if there's something

218
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:05,653
that needs to be sp- I don't
know, smoked stuff, it's amazing

219
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:07,513
[chuckles].

220
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:08,593
And garlic as well. So, yeah.

221
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:12,913
Dan: I like it. I almost said- I
almost said --

222
00:08:12,913 --> 00:08:14,338
Bekah: I think all those things
in a sauce together would be

223
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:15,763
great.

224
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:15,764
Dan: Yeah.

225
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:17,338
Bogdan: I think, yeah. But I
have -- I- I mean, I have to

226
00:08:17,338 --> 00:08:18,912
agree,

227
00:08:18,913 --> 00:08:23,533
like, with Dan's friend, like
living alone, like, it just --

228
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:26,414
there's -- there are no rules. I
... you know? [Bogdan and Dan

229
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,559
Laugh] I do what I want. I put

230
00:08:28,564 --> 00:08:30,016
everything where I want. And
also, I'm the only one that

231
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:31,468
needs to

232
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:34,000
know where it's placed. So,
yeah. I don't put my --

233
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:36,006
Bekah: So, do- do you put your
Chipotle ... condiment in the

234
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:39,013
refrigerator?

235
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:42,658
Bogdan: I do. But I'm not sure
if I have- have to? I don't

236
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:44,547
think it's

237
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:46,843
forbidden, right [laughs]? But I
just -- I- I- I was just -- it

238
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:49,138
keeps me sane. Cuz

239
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:51,494
I had a ti- I had a tiny Tabasco
bottles, but like, I feel like

240
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:53,849
the

241
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:56,234
vinegar goes up, and then I try
to shake it, and it doesn't. And

242
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:58,619
then

243
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:00,223
it's all you -- vinegary, and I
don't like it. So I keep it in

244
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:01,827
the fridge,

245
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:02,000
just to be sure.

246
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

247
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Bekah: That's interesting.

248
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Bogdan: But I dunno.

249
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,509
Bekah: I should try that
experiment.

250
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:08,826
Bogdan: I dunno. But no,
tomatoes don't go into fridge.

251
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:11,143
Like, I'm --

252
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:14,173
it's just nuts. It's the way it
is, my friends [laughs].

253
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,589
Bekah: Yes. No, 100% agree with
you.

254
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:17,984
Bogdan: Yeah.

255
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:22,198
Bekah: Well, thanks for being
with us here today, Bogdan. And

256
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:27,839
we like to start every podcast
episode with your origin story.

257
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,198
So, talk to us a little bit
about how you got into tech.

258
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:35,533
Bogdan: Okay. Thank you for
having me. I just -- I- I mean,

259
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:40,364
I want to start with, like, I
think it's very unfair how clear

260
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,757
Dan sound- sounds compared to
the two of us [laughs], Bekah.

261
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:45,000
Cuz do

262
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
you -- do -- you don't post it
like this. You don't sound that

263
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,173
cool in the actual [laughs]
talk, I see. Like, there's

264
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,874
some mixing going on, right?

265
00:09:52,874 --> 00:09:54,808
Dan: What? Wait. Are you saying
--

266
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:55,964
Bogdan: You s- you sound very
cool.

267
00:09:56,548 --> 00:09:57,224
Dan: Oh. No idea.

268
00:09:57,224 --> 00:09:59,624
Bogdan: And I don't. I- I don't
know. But I'm looking at those

269
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:01,244
things moving on the screen, and
he -- yours are ... bigger

270
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:02,864
[laughs].

271
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:07,964
Dan: Well, okay. Well, I might
just be talking louder or

272
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:09,448
having way -- that might be too-
too loud, actually. I wasn't

273
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:10,932
really

274
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,303
looking at it until just now.
This is --

275
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:15,396
Bekah: I think it looks
different on different screens

276
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:16,754
too. Like-

277
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:16,754
Dan: That's probably true too.

278
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:17,009
Bekah: -mine looks very-

279
00:10:17,000--> 00:10:17,000
Bogdan: Ah.

280
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:19,149
Bekah: -tiny, like, barely --
so- so,

281
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:21,000
okay. If you're listening --

282
00:10:19,149  --> 00:10:23,548
Dan: Yeah, yours is probably, honestly,
like [chuckles], I mean, and I try

283
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:25,318
to do this, like I fix this up
in editing later. I try to,

284
00:10:25,318 --> 00:10:27,088
right?

285
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:27,479
Bogdan: Yeah.

286
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,159
Dan: So, this is like sound
engineering stuff that I've been

287
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,839
learning on

288
00:10:30,844 --> 00:10:32,251
the fly since we were started
working the podcast [chuckles].

289
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:33,658
So

290
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:36,658
I don't, you know, I don't know
a lot about it. But like, the --

291
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:40,589
trying to get those levels, you
know, to where it's close to the

292
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:44,219
edges is usually the best. So,
Bekah is like, I -- yeah, like-

293
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:46,048
like -- what I was saying is
you're a little quiet, still,

294
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:47,668
you know [chuckles]?

295
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:48,839
Bekah: I'm quiet?

296
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:51,808
Dan: A little bit. Not a lot.

297
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:52,558
Bekah: I didn't turn up my
sound. You didn't tell me to.

298
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:54,838
Dan: Well, I didn't really
notice before. And also, in --

299
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:56,728
so, for those --

300
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:58,499
I don't know if we're gonna cut
this or not, but for people

301
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:00,463
listening, we use Zencastr, and
it doesn't show you these nice

302
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:02,427
level

303
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:06,448
outputs until you're recording.
Which is-

304
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:06,869
Bogdan: Yeah.

305
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:09,996
Dan: -really obnoxious. It's
hard to tell. So, I don't know.

306
00:11:09,996 --> 00:11:13,123
But, Bogdan, do

307
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:14,971
you have -- is that the Wave- is
that the Wave:1? Wave:3?

308
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:16,813
[Unintelligible]?

309
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:19,000
Bogdan: You are Wave:3.

310
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Dan: Wave:3?

311
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,422
Bogdan: But no, it was a
compliment. We don't have to go

312
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:22,844
into it. It's also very --

313
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:23,437
Dan: Oh, no. It's -- so, I mean,
I- I just got- I just got the

314
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:24,000
Wave:3,

315
like, last week, and it's been like-

316
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:27,313
Bogdan: It- it -- yeah. I have
... yeah. It's --

317
00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:28,574
Dan: -a day getting it set up.
So I can send you some stuff

318
00:11:28,574 --> 00:11:29,624
[chuckles].

319
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:32,000
Bogdan: It's ... no, it's
Wave:3, right? It is.

320
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Dan: It looks like it.

321
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,341
Bogdan: Yeah. It's Wave:3. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like it.

322
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:35,682
It's nice.

323
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,243
Dan: Yeah. I got- I got -- I
like it too. I just got it ...

324
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:38,653
yeah. Two weeks ago.

325
00:11:38,683 --> 00:11:39,703
Or a week and half ago. So ...
I'll send you some stuff.

326
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:42,513
Bogdan: It- it -- yeah. But i-
is your room, like, prepared for

327
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:44,652
this? Cuz you-

328
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:44,653
Dan: No.

329
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:46,000
Bogdan: -sound insanely good.

330
Dan: Nope. It's just --

331
Bogdan: Like, there's no way
mine sounds like this.

332
00:11:48,524--> 00:11:50,000
Dan: Yours sounds pretty good.

333
00:11:49,004  --> 00:11:50,000
Bekah: You sound really good.

334
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Dan: I think one thing is, you
probably could be closer to your

335
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,114
mic? That's -- I mean, maybe
not. I don't know.

336
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:57,388
When you're -- it's when you're
moving away -- so, like, if I

337
00:11:57,388 --> 00:11:58,662
sit

338
00:11:58,663 --> 00:12:01,933
back here, does that sound- that
sounds like noticeably worse?

339
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:02,354
More echo-y -- echo thing?

340
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:03,000
Bekah: So- so for the listeners-

341
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Bogdan: Yeah [laughs].

342
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Dan: Yeah [laughs]?

343
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,099
Bekah: Dan has scooted his seat
back about four feet.

344
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Dan: All right.

345
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Bogdan: Okay, okay, okay
[laughs].

346
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:13,453
Dan: So- so that was the one
thing I- I read about --

347
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,984
so they do like- do like the
hang 10 like this, you know, or-

348
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,484
or

349
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:19,484
whatever. And then that's like
distance from-

350
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:20,242
Bogdan: Oh, okay. Than that
should not move. Which is make

351
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:21,000
sense.

352
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:21,148
Dan: -your mouth to the
microphone that should be ...

353
00:12:21,148 --> 00:12:22,812
right. And that's- that's hard.
Yeah. It's

354
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:26,293
hard not to- it's hard not to
move. But like, that gets you

355
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:27,146
picked up more, but then there's
a bunch of other stuff too, so

356
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:27,999
--

357
Bogdan: Okay.

358
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:29,000
Dan: We don't have to get into
it on that.

359
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Bogdan: Maybe we -- yeah.

360
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,543
Dan: Maybe we do a whole episode
on it sometime [laughs].

361
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:34,109
Bogdan: [Chuckles] Okay. Sorry.
I'm sorry.

362
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:34,303
Dan: Anyway --

363
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:35,683
Bekah: Maybe- maybe a live
stream. And then, the visual

364
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:37,063
will be

365
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:38,908
easier to the scene.

366
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:40,333
Bogdan: Yeah, screen the sh-
screen the share -- share the

367
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,758
screen [laughs]. Yeah.

368
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,000
Dan: Okay. Anyway, I don't know
what you-

369
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Bogdan: Origin story.

370
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Bekah: Origin story.

371
Dan: -were saying, or you were
talking -- yes [laughs].

372
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,189
Bogdan: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. We
were doing about origin story.

373
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:51,509
Well, yeah. Yeah. It's

374
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:54,711
very- it's very linear and
r-r-rather boring, but ... yeah.

375
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:57,913
Cuz

376
00:12:57,913 --> 00:12:59,773
I did -- so, in Romania we have
high schools that are very

377
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:01,633
specialized.

378
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:05,114
And I did one of those with
computer science. So I kind of

379
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:07,588
knew I wanted. I- I have -- my
family is mainly like,

380
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:10,062
musicians.

381
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:12,854
A lot of them are trained
musicians, so I didn't wanna do

382
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:15,284
that cuz I thought it's boring,
and [laughs] fired back to me a

383
00:13:15,284 --> 00:13:17,714
few years

384
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,024
later. But yeah, I thought it's
boring. So I went straight to

385
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:22,259
like this mathematics computer
science high school. So I- I

386
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,494
kind of knew

387
00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:25,814
I wanted to do this. I kind of
hated it at the time as well,

388
00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:27,134
you

389
00:13:27,134 --> 00:13:30,703
know? The whole C, C++ things
that don't make any sense

390
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:34,244
when you're young and you just
wanna make -- was the

391
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:37,004
rectangle move on the screen,
right? I don't wanna spend my --

392
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:38,773
yeah. Anyways. But yeah, I
graduated that, and then I moved

393
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:40,542
to

394
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:43,514
The Netherlands to do applied
computer science, which was

395
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:45,958
another [chuckles] surprise. Cuz
it was this program of like

396
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,402
computer

397
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:51,344
science, of course, but like,
electrical engineering as well,

398
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:53,728
which, look. I could have
[chuckles] look it up, and I did

399
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:55,663
look it up. Like,

400
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:57,058
I kind of knew what the program
was, right? But I did -- I

401
00:13:57,058 --> 00:13:58,453
wasn't sure

402
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:00,524
if this gonna be a lot of -- I
didn't even know what's

403
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:02,504
electrical engineering and
turned out to be like very ...

404
00:14:02,504 --> 00:14:04,484
not cool [laughs].

405
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:07,093
Like, not- no-not toward the
field itself. This is just for

406
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:08,922
me, like in

407
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:10,805
university years. It was -- I
was like, yeah. Still, I wanna

408
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:12,687
make

409
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,938
rectangles move. But then I wa-
got super, super, super lucky in

410
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,037
my

411
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:21,208
first year of university, I
think. I got a job — remote

412
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,143
job — in Romania for like one of
my friends' father that had

413
00:14:23,143 --> 00:14:25,078
this, like

414
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:29,188
e-commerce kind of low key
business, where I got into

415
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:32,038
Node. I did not lie on my
interview, but something made

416
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,888
him

417
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,879
think I actually know Node. I- I
did- I did know about Node,

418
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:39,000
right? I was like [laughs] --

419
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,889
Dan: You've heard- you've heard
of it. Yeah, yeah.

420
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:43,679
Bogdan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cuz I
did -- so I, like, the -- I

421
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,494
remember -- so, the very

422
00:14:45,494 --> 00:14:47,939
first thing I did, like, web
development was, back in high

423
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:50,384
school was like

424
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:53,953
this pi- p5.js — which is still
around, they're very much

425
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:59,264
happening — but there was this
-- people doing this c-c-coding

426
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:00,973
train, they were super into it,
and I did like -- they did,

427
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:02,653
like, the

428
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,533
snake, and I did the snake, and
then I wanted to- to do, like-

429
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:11,183
like a multiplayer thing or like
a chat room for it, and I- I-

430
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:13,461
I knew that you can use Node to
do that [laughs]. And that was

431
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:15,734
the only

432
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:19,423
information I had. And I was
like, "Yeah, you can do like,

433
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:21,946
WebsSockets, right?" Yeah. But
anyways, they were- they were-

434
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:24,044
they were very nice to me and
like, they actually hired me,

435
00:15:24,044 --> 00:15:25,844
and I

436
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:27,181
learned a lot about like
databases, and Node, and stuff

437
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:28,513
like

438
00:15:28,514 --> 00:15:32,953
that. And then the second year
of university came in when I was

439
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:35,023
actually teaching more
programming. And I finally kind

440
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:36,672
of

441
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:39,344
overlapped the two, and be like,
"Oh, okay, I'm doing this for my

442
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:40,859
job. I'm learning about this,"
you know? We're -- even in

443
00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:42,374
school, we learned

444
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:44,278
a bit like about testing, and
CI/CD, and things like that. I

445
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,153
was like,

446
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,838
"Oh, this is actually cool and
useful." So I ... yeah ... tried

447
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:51,523
to

448
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:54,119
[chuckles] finish school, and
then [laughs] continued, then I

449
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,714
got a university job like

450
00:15:56,714 --> 00:16:00,786
teaching Java, which was- which
was bad [laughs]. Look, I have

451
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:04,858
this theory

452
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:06,958
and [laughs] I hope I never have
to- to get a teaching job again

453
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,057
cuz if

454
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:10,528
I say this. No, I don't. No,
it's not- no, it's not- it's not

455
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:11,998
a hard

456
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:13,574
day. But it's just like,
teaching programming, it's so

457
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:15,149
easy. Cuz

458
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:17,475
you just like -- you just say,
like, "I -- I'm- I'm- I'm gonna

459
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:19,797
show

460
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:21,013
you how to Google." And if they
have questions, you just Google

461
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,228
[Dan chuckles]

462
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:24,028
in front of them, and I -- and-
and- and find out things

463
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:25,827
together. Which

464
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:27,508
is nice, you know? They also do
-- need to know how to Google.

465
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,188
But,

466
00:16:29,193 --> 00:16:30,781
yeah. And then I got an
internship at another

467
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,369
university,

468
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:37,798
but for research. And then I
moved here, to another city,

469
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:42,543
while still studying. I did my
internship, I got a full

470
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,413
contract after, but Corona
happened. So I was staying here

471
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:49,414
working full-time while ...
finishing my- my- my bachelor

472
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:52,354
basic

473
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:55,689
or barely like [chuckles] trying
to finish my- my bachelor. And

474
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:59,024
then I- I --

475
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:02,803
the- the Maastricht University
research position was absolutely

476
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:06,554
amazing. Like, it's -- it was
academia, which was kind of new

477
00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:07,978
to me, cuz I- I always knew I
wanna be an -- a developer,

478
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:09,402
right? Or

479
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,008
an engineer. But I was like,
"Okay, we can combine this,"

480
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:12,613
right?

481
00:17:12,618 --> 00:17:13,951
I don't know a- a lot about
research, but I [chuckles] know

482
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,284
about

483
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,919
development, so we can
definitely overlap. Cuz it was

484
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,554
also like a

485
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:22,026
legal -- kind of legal tech
[silence] space, where they had

486
00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:25,498
a lot of

487
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:27,584
data where they had a lot of
ideas about tech, but th-they

488
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:29,669
did

489
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:31,214
the developers. So, yeah, we
kind of combined it very nice.

490
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:32,759
But

491
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,668
things slowly came to an end.
And finally, two months ago I

492
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:38,518
got a

493
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:44,038
new software engineering job, to
a digital creative internet,

494
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:46,798
whatever they [chuckles] call it
-- agency, in The Netherlands.

495
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:49,468
So I plan

496
00:17:50,294 --> 00:17:52,319
to- to stay doing Node,
basically. Root Node, React,

497
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,344
TypeScript, things like

498
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:57,658
that. So, yeah. I think that's-
that's it. This is today

499
00:17:57,658 --> 00:18:00,972
[laughs]. Just

500
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:02,000
recently joined a --

501
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Bekah: A cool --

502
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Bogdan: Yeah.

503
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,104
Bekah: You recently joined ...
I'm sorry. I think I cut you

504
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:06,208
off.

505
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:07,768
Bogdan: Yeah, no. That was it.
Just recently, [chuckles] like

506
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:09,162
two months

507
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:11,368
ago, I think. It was April. So,
yeah.

508
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:13,003
Bekah: So I wanna back up a
little bit and ask some

509
00:18:13,003 --> 00:18:14,428
questions

510
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:16,544
about the schooling that you've
done. So, it sounds like there

511
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:18,659
was

512
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:22,888
maybe more practical application
than I've seen from universities

513
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:26,219
in the United States, which
computer science degrees have a

514
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:28,888
lot of, like, theoretical
content, algorithms, and that

515
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:31,557
kind

516
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,429
of stuff. Is that- is that
accurate statement? Or were you

517
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:36,269
doing a lot of that stuff too?

518
00:18:38,278 --> 00:18:40,243
Bogdan: Yeah. We- we were doing
that for sure as well. But yeah,

519
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:42,208
with an

520
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:44,143
eye on electrical engineering
and kind of like -- so, in- in

521
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:46,077
The

522
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:47,623
Netherlands, they have this
system of like universities,

523
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:49,168
what

524
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,133
they call universities --
research universities, which is

525
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:53,097
basically

526
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,063
like a college university in-
in- the US as well, right? Where

527
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:57,028
they, you

528
00:18:57,034 --> 00:18:58,756
know, they teach, you know, like
a normal [chuckles] university.

529
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:00,478
And they have these

530
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,778
things ... this like, just
wh-wh-what they call

531
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:07,077
'hogeschool' or like 'HBO's,
where-

532
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:10,979
where like more professional
schools. In English, they

533
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:12,719
call them Universities of
Applied Sciences, but it's in-

534
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,459
in- in

535
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:16,709
Dutch doesn't really go -- it's
not ... really -- I think it --

536
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:18,959
I- I

537
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:20,055
think it's a university, but
like -- yeah, there's a

538
00:19:20,055 --> 00:19:21,147
difference.

539
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:23,505
Here's like more of a -- like a
very- like a very engineering,

540
00:19:23,505 --> 00:19:25,857
like kind

541
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:27,876
of applied -- hands on
experience. It's also longer.

542
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,894
It's four years

543
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:31,244
instead of three. And you have
to do internships, you have to

544
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:32,594
work

545
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:34,814
with companies, you have to work
with clients, and things like

546
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:37,574
that, which is for people that
wanna do, you know, wanna

547
00:19:37,574 --> 00:19:38,998
get straight to- to work and
things like that. Which goes

548
00:19:38,998 --> 00:19:40,422
very

549
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:42,374
well for like, engineering, and
things like that.

550
00:19:43,874 --> 00:19:44,114
Bekah: Yeah. Interesting.

551
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:47,233
Bogdan: So, it was one of those,
you know? Where you- where you

552
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:50,203
have like, more like
programming, but like kind of

553
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:53,173
rather like ... the-

554
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:54,796
the applied part was like more
the electrical part rather than

555
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:56,413
web,

556
00:19:56,534 --> 00:20:00,943
right? Like we didn't- we didn't
learn about web development, but

557
00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:02,998
we did learn about operating
systems or microcontrollers or

558
00:20:02,998 --> 00:20:05,053
thing that

559
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:07,000
go into electrical engineering
field.

560
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Dan: Did you have to do
assembly?

561
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Bogdan: I think I did not-

562
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Dan: Oh, that's good.

563
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,226
Bogdan: -unfortunately. No, but
we- we -- it was- it was insane.

564
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:16,452
Like, I

565
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:19,138
absolutely -- it- it- it was
insane. And- and- and we did

566
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:21,823
microcontrollers, of

567
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:23,571
course, and all that, like, chip
programming, and things like

568
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:25,318
that,

569
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:27,583
which I absolutely dreaded
[chuckles] and I couldn't wait

570
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,848
to be over.

571
00:20:29,848 --> 00:20:31,273
And although it was interesting,
right? Like, operating systems

572
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,698
was

573
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:36,868
such an interesting thing, but
it's just like the- the- the

574
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:41,939
whole thing of like patterns,
and ideas, and things you

575
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:44,549
can have in web development, you
-- I couldn't have in- in

576
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:47,159
operating

577
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:48,929
systems, you know? You- you
can't get too creative about

578
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:50,699
[chuckles] it. Cuz

579
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:52,153
there are -- especially in
microcontrollers, like, they-

580
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:53,607
they

581
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:55,768
have this- this huge books and
guides about- about them, and

582
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:57,928
you

583
00:20:57,929 --> 00:20:59,413
have to know things, and you
have to look for things that are

584
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:00,897
just

585
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:02,956
set, right? Or- or- or, you
know, I don't know enough to-

586
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:05,009
to- to make this [chuckles]

587
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:06,778
conclusion, but it's still like
-- the way I saw it was like,

588
00:21:06,778 --> 00:21:08,158
this

589
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,898
is -- I can't- I can't be
creative here, you know? But I

590
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:15,778
finished it anyways. But, yeah
[laughs].

591
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:17,504
Dan: Yeah. No, I- I love that. I
love hearing about that, you

592
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:18,614
know?

593
00:21:18,614 --> 00:21:20,308
And you have used this phrase a
few times when you're telling

594
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:22,002
the story

595
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:23,833
about ... like, I didn't get to
move around boxes or like, you

596
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,663
know,

597
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:27,223
move around boxes [Dan and
Bogdan chuckles] like, and like,

598
00:21:27,223 --> 00:21:28,783
I- I -- and like, it's -- I know
that's like a

599
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:29,954
funny way of saying it, but I- I
totally connect with that

600
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:31,124
because

601
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:34,784
that's- that's something that I
personally, like ... I don't

602
00:21:34,784 --> 00:21:35,893
think -- I mean, I never- I
never put it exactly like that,

603
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:37,002
but it's the

604
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:40,784
same thing of that -- the thing
that drew me to programming was

605
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:42,913
the -- was that. Was moving
around boxes. Or like doing a

606
00:21:42,913 --> 00:21:45,012
thing, like,

607
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:46,949
doing a thing, and then getting
to see it, like, move or happen

608
00:21:46,949 --> 00:21:48,584
or ...

609
00:21:49,663 --> 00:21:52,814
just see it in front of me,
right? And- and while, like

610
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:55,483
academically, some of the more
like the operating -- the lower

611
00:21:55,483 --> 00:21:57,783
level stuff is, you know,
interesting, maybe [chuckles],

612
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,083
you know? I lo-

613
00:22:00,314 --> 00:22:01,679
I totally lost my connection to
all of it. Like, I- I -- like --

614
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,044
and I --

615
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:04,543
like I said this before, that's-
that's when I switched majors

616
00:22:04,543 --> 00:22:05,653
out of

617
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:07,588
computer sciences was, I was
deep into that- that ... like,

618
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:09,523
section, you

619
00:22:09,523 --> 00:22:11,294
know what I mean? As, you know,
assembling, and I was doing -- I

620
00:22:11,294 --> 00:22:13,258
wasn't ... yeah, I don't know. I
don't think I was -- that

621
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:15,222
semester, had

622
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:17,668
even done anything where I got
to like hit save or compile and

623
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:20,113
see something

624
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:22,093
happen, you know what I mean
[chuckles]? And it- and it was

625
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:23,503
just like --

626
00:22:23,503 --> 00:22:26,128
and I lost my interest, you
know? And I think the -- it

627
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:28,753
seems

628
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:33,104
like you have acknowledged that
in, you know, yourself and use

629
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:35,953
that as — maybe whether it was
consciously or not — use that as

630
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:38,773
like a sort of driving force in-
in finding, you know, your path,

631
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:40,678
and- and like your happiness.
Like, you could have, possibly,

632
00:22:40,678 --> 00:22:42,433
and

633
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:43,798
maybe -- I mean, some people, I
guess, could have forced

634
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:45,163
themselves down the

635
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,893
line of, you know, the
electrical engineering and

636
00:22:47,893 --> 00:22:50,623
gotten a job ... I

637
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,619
don't know, soldering things
[chuckles] or something. I dunno

638
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:54,614
[laughs]. But- but-

639
00:22:54,644 --> 00:22:56,354
but, you know, but like you ...
I don't know. It- it's -- I- I

640
00:22:56,354 --> 00:22:58,064
just

641
00:22:58,068 --> 00:22:59,086
connect with that. I- I just
wanted to like, kind of

642
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,104
highlight that

643
00:23:00,108 --> 00:23:02,265
because it's -- it- it --
finding what makes you happy in

644
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:04,422
a- in a field

645
00:23:04,423 --> 00:23:05,608
is- is important. Especially
com- field like computer

646
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:06,793
science,

647
00:23:06,794 --> 00:23:08,908
because there are gonna be some
people that ... will get into

648
00:23:08,908 --> 00:23:11,022
those

649
00:23:11,054 --> 00:23:13,874
microcontrollers and be totally
hooked, you know? And-

650
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:14,743
Bogdan: Yeah, of course. Some
find it cool [??], right? Yeah.

651
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:15,958
Dan: -some people- some people
not, you know? And ... right.

652
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,173
Yeah.

653
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:19,804
No. So, I- I think that's great.

654
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,603
Bogdan: Yeah, no, for sure. I
mean, I'm not- I'm not- I'm not

655
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:23,638
...

656
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:25,408
yeah. It's just like -- also,
like, I remember since I was

657
00:23:25,408 --> 00:23:26,998
younger

658
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:28,768
from high school, like, people
had a thing for Arduinos, which

659
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,537
I

660
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:32,506
think that- I- I think that- I
think that's what -- I think

661
00:23:32,506 --> 00:23:34,468
that's

662
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:35,923
why I thought it's gonna be
cool. Cuz like everybody was

663
00:23:35,923 --> 00:23:37,377
like, "Oh

664
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:39,133
my god. Arduino. Like, you -- we
have to do this," and things

665
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:40,888
like that. And

666
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:42,979
I'm like, "I do -- okay
[chuckles]." I- I loved it,

667
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:44,699
right? I think it's cool.

668
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:47,013
Like, Raspberry Pis and things
like that is fun. But ... yeah.

669
00:23:47,013 --> 00:23:49,327
Yeah. I

670
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:52,058
think, I ... yeah. Like, there
where I agree with you.

671
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:55,568
Like, I need to see immediate
change, and I- I need a reaction

672
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:56,888
from things I'm doing cuz
otherwise, I feel like I spend

673
00:23:56,888 --> 00:23:58,208
the

674
00:23:58,209 --> 00:24:00,000
whole day doing nothing. That's
not super-

675
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Dan: Yeah.

676
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,348
Bogdan: -productive [chuckles].

677
00:24:03,348 --> 00:24:06,063
Bekah: So, when you were doing
the research part of things, was

678
00:24:06,063 --> 00:24:08,778
that

679
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:14,028
more ... data sciencey or what
were you doing there?

680
00:24:16,048 --> 00:24:17,698
Bogdan: Yeah. Kind of. Yeah. We
had a lot of ... yeah. There

681
00:24:17,698 --> 00:24:19,348
was-

682
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:21,733
there- there was data science
part, and again, diving in with

683
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:24,088
little

684
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:27,269
data science knowledge, cuz I
didn't -- yeah, I didn't study

685
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:29,884
that. I had ideas. I- I knew
Python, for example. But I got

686
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:32,499
--

687
00:24:32,503 --> 00:24:35,251
I- I- I got very -- I got- I
gotten -- [chuckles] get very

688
00:24:35,251 --> 00:24:37,999
lucky to- to find this amazing

689
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:40,699
person that really, really took
care of everything, like my

690
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:42,459
mentor, and one of my manager,
bosses, whatever. The person

691
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:44,219
that

692
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:45,898
I actually got a job through.
And she was super amazing. And

693
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:47,577
she

694
00:24:47,578 --> 00:24:49,558
found all these cool
opportunities, and all these

695
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:53,578
relations, and connections, and
papers we wrote, and projects we

696
00:24:53,578 --> 00:24:56,188
got in. So, I had the time to-
to learn it on- on the way,

697
00:24:56,188 --> 00:24:58,798
right?

698
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:00,388
Like, I didn't have to worry
like, "Oh, what am I gonna do

699
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:01,978
now?" I'm

700
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:03,418
always just like, I knew what I
have to do, but I also knew

701
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,857
what-

702
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,644
what I have to learn. So there
was amazing. But then we also

703
00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:13,064
did APIs, for example, which was
my previous job as well. And I

704
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:15,621
think this is one of the things
that ... kind of help them make

705
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:18,178
the

706
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,209
decision to hire me cuz they
were working already on these

707
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:23,143
APIs. But again, related data,
like, they had -- we had a lot

708
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:25,077
of

709
00:25:25,078 --> 00:25:28,169
data. We needed to serve it to
different sources, to different

710
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:31,739
other universities, for example,
create some user interfaces, and

711
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:37,169
stuff like that. So we created
this APIs ... for them.

712
00:25:37,348 --> 00:25:38,773
Which was more engineering, but
then, yeah. The data science

713
00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:40,198
part,

714
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,969
we did a lot of machine
learning, and analysis, and NLP

715
00:25:41,969 --> 00:25:43,739
for the papers

716
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:46,501
we were- we were writing. It's
very [chuckles] different and

717
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:49,259
definitely

718
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:52,078
some- something that I really
enjoy doing, but I- I knew it --

719
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,239
the- the- the whole- the whole
way -- and it was almost three

720
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:56,219
years,

721
00:25:56,219 --> 00:25:59,368
right? I knew the whole time, I
don't wanna do that. I really

722
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:00,856
much enjoyed it. And I really
much loved working with all

723
00:26:00,856 --> 00:26:02,338
these

724
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:05,909
people, but I- I knew for sure,
it's- it's not something I'm

725
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:08,646
gonna spend my, you know, my
next, whatever years doing. So

726
00:26:08,646 --> 00:26:11,383
it was like --

727
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:14,743
Bekah: Was there- was there like
a moment that you realized that?

728
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:19,094
Or it was just kind of like, "I
can do this, but I'm not super

729
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:19,933
interested in it."?

730
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,188
Bogdan: Yeah ... We-well
[laughs], I kind of learned on

731
00:26:23,188 --> 00:26:24,762
the job, right? So I

732
00:26:24,763 --> 00:26:28,064
didn't have a moment to actually
reflect, but it was keep on

733
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:33,314
coming, keep on coming. I am
talking about moving rectangles

734
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:35,923
again [chuckles]. This is very
serious, so don't- don't take it

735
00:26:35,923 --> 00:26:38,338
too seriously, but it is. And I
-- it's not that [chuckles]

736
00:26:38,338 --> 00:26:40,753
seriously. But I ... so,

737
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:44,224
look. I like ... I like things
to- to- to look good. It's- it's

738
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:47,239
very

739
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,058
silly, but I like the tools that
I use to look very good.

740
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,000
And Jupyter notebooks are not
[laughs]. And of course, you can

741
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,818
load them in VSCode, and things
like that. But the whole

742
00:26:55,818 --> 00:26:59,778
concept of like staring the
whole day at those notebooks was

743
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:01,773
something ... it was something
weird for me. I was like, it's

744
00:27:01,773 --> 00:27:03,768
not

745
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:05,374
supposed to be like that. I
don't know if you ever worked

746
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,979
wi-with data,

747
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:09,263
or with people that are doing
data stuff, but those notebooks

748
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:11,547
are

749
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:15,269
getting extremely messy. I don't
know if it's for everybody or it

750
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:17,428
was- it was just for us, it was
insanely messy. Like there's --

751
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,587
there- there's --

752
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:22,378
there was impossible to, like,
pick up a notebook I wrote, you

753
00:27:22,378 --> 00:27:24,327
know,

754
00:27:24,388 --> 00:27:25,633
three weeks ago, and I still
understand it. Like, it was- it

755
00:27:25,633 --> 00:27:26,878
was

756
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,489
insane. So I was like, I don't
know for how long I can, like,

757
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:33,111
guessing my, you know, my- my
thoughts [chuckles], you know?

758
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:36,223
So, of course,

759
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:37,843
I mean, there's -- there are
ways to do it better. It's not

760
00:27:37,843 --> 00:27:39,463
like I

761
00:27:39,463 --> 00:27:41,593
tried everything. It was just
like ... the comfort of like

762
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,723
working,

763
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:47,144
and things like that. I think
more. And also, I didn't know,

764
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:48,861
and I still don't know, and I'm
not at all interested in

765
00:27:48,861 --> 00:27:50,578
statistics,

766
00:27:50,578 --> 00:27:54,328
which ... of course we can argue
if that's important or not. But

767
00:27:54,328 --> 00:27:55,963
I felt like I should. Like, we
are talking ab- we were always

768
00:27:55,963 --> 00:27:57,598
talking

769
00:27:57,604 --> 00:28:00,781
about this models, and probab-
probabilities, and numbers, and

770
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:03,958
constants, and things

771
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:06,838
like that, that I never had an
idea about, which I was

772
00:28:06,844 --> 00:28:09,689
trying to, but like, it seemed
like I'm really, really, really

773
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:13,588
like behind all of this. And I
don't have the- the- the passion

774
00:28:13,588 --> 00:28:14,608
to- to learn it.

775
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:19,638
Bekah: So it's ... oh, it sounds
like you kind of knew what you

776
00:28:19,638 --> 00:28:24,048
wanted to be doing and you did
kind of enjoy that research

777
00:28:24,048 --> 00:28:28,068
aspect of things, but you knew
that was not gonna be like the

778
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:30,985
place that you -- your ideal job
or what you wanted to be doing.

779
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:33,902
So,

780
00:28:34,284 --> 00:28:37,373
how did you make that decision
to move from that research

781
00:28:37,373 --> 00:28:40,462
position

782
00:28:40,624 --> 00:28:43,503
and do something that you would
rather be doing?

783
00:28:45,078 --> 00:28:47,613
Bogdan: So I- I never really
knew what I wanted to do af-

784
00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:50,148
i-i-in- in the time --

785
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:54,191
the -- wh-what -- all I wanted
to- to do -- no. All I knew was,

786
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:57,363
so we- we were- we were

787
00:28:57,364 --> 00:28:59,989
doing a lot of programming by
the end of my employment list.

788
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:02,614
So on

789
00:29:02,614 --> 00:29:04,668
the way ... after the last
summer -- so, basically last

790
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:06,722
summer,

791
00:29:06,753 --> 00:29:08,763
cuz I left in February, right?
So, after the last summer, a lot

792
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:10,773
of

793
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,925
other -- not a lot. Like,
important people that I was

794
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:14,867
working close

795
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:18,588
with -- seniors, left. So I was
kind of around, trying stuff.

796
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:22,308
And

797
00:29:22,608 --> 00:29:24,348
having another -- other people,
like on the same level with me,

798
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:26,088
and

799
00:29:26,088 --> 00:29:29,103
things like that, it's really
became ... not, you know ...

800
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:32,118
productive.

801
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,619
And I'm not- and I'm not saying
it's a bad thing. I think it's

802
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:34,759
a- it's a- it's

803
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:38,148
a great thing for them to kind
of have the- the, you know, this

804
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:39,588
growing experience, and maybe
growing pains, cuz it was still

805
00:29:39,588 --> 00:29:40,818
a

806
00:29:40,818 --> 00:29:44,959
very young lab, right? Kind of
understand th-th-that seniorship

807
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:46,353
matters, and things like that.
And you need mentorship, and you

808
00:29:46,353 --> 00:29:47,628
need

809
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:49,113
seniors, and things like that.
So there was a thing. So I was-

810
00:29:49,113 --> 00:29:50,598
I

811
00:29:50,598 --> 00:29:52,263
was slacking a little bit behind
because I had a- I had a very

812
00:29:52,263 --> 00:29:53,928
weird

813
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:59,959
period after I got COVID. Even a
year after, I was still

814
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:02,358
very sick and things like that.
So they were very, very nice and

815
00:30:02,358 --> 00:30:07,278
kind to allow me to- to- to work
as- as- as much as I can. Which

816
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:09,843
was [chuckles] not a lot, right?
So I- I- I did the work that I

817
00:30:09,843 --> 00:30:12,408
had

818
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:15,169
to do as- as- as much as I can,
and then when I got a little bit

819
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:19,713
better, I started looking for
jobs. And I wasn't sure what I

820
00:30:19,713 --> 00:30:22,548
want to do. I- I- I was ... I
think in -- by the end of the

821
00:30:22,548 --> 00:30:25,383
year, I

822
00:30:25,384 --> 00:30:27,131
think it was November or
whatever, I've been to web

823
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,878
summit in

824
00:30:28,878 --> 00:30:33,499
Lisbon. And I've seen all these
companies, and all these

825
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:36,919
hot apps, and all these software
engineers doing a lot of cool

826
00:30:36,923 --> 00:30:38,105
things. And I was like, "I wanna
do cool things, but I didn't

827
00:30:38,105 --> 00:30:39,287
know

828
00:30:39,294 --> 00:30:41,286
what a cool thing is
[chuckles]." But I just wanted

829
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:43,278
to, you know, I just

830
00:30:43,284 --> 00:30:45,709
wanted to feel like I'm doing
very cool things, which I was

831
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:46,788
doing at the moment, but in a
different way. Not in an

832
00:30:46,788 --> 00:30:47,867
academic

833
00:30:47,868 --> 00:30:50,405
[chuckles] way, right? Yeah. And
I just- I just applied to the

834
00:30:50,405 --> 00:30:52,942
startups

835
00:30:52,943 --> 00:30:54,668
that I knew there are in
Netherlands, that kind of met

836
00:30:54,668 --> 00:30:56,393
there a bunch to

837
00:30:56,394 --> 00:30:58,611
another companies, and a bunch
of agencies. Cuz I have a f- a

838
00:30:58,611 --> 00:31:00,828
friend that is very

839
00:31:00,828 --> 00:31:03,018
much into, like, agencies. He
also has this very tiny agency,

840
00:31:03,018 --> 00:31:05,208
doing

841
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:08,439
like branding and marketing for
people, and things like that.

842
00:31:08,778 --> 00:31:13,249
And he was living with me at the
moment. And -- but he was away,

843
00:31:13,308 --> 00:31:15,063
and I was start to apply for
jobs, and randomly told him

844
00:31:15,063 --> 00:31:16,818
like, "Hey,

845
00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:18,681
dude. I applied for this
creative agencies -- creative

846
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:20,538
agency in

847
00:31:20,538 --> 00:31:22,473
Amsterdam. What do you think
about it?" And then the flood

848
00:31:22,473 --> 00:31:24,408
gets over [??] --

849
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:27,094
and he showed me, and told me,
and sent me all I could know

850
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:28,969
about [chuckles]

851
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:30,948
agencies in The Netherlands,
which is very cool. Cuz I wasn't

852
00:31:30,948 --> 00:31:32,298
sure

853
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:33,573
if I wanted to do that, but it
sta- finally started to make

854
00:31:33,573 --> 00:31:34,848
sense.

855
00:31:34,854 --> 00:31:38,088
Like, I need- I need something
very dynamic, and I need to move

856
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:41,959
around. But I also need a
structure which you sometimes,

857
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:45,739
arguably, don't get in startups
and things like that. So

858
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,199
yeah, like, an agency seemed
like a- like a- like a good

859
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:50,659
place.

860
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:52,793
But then I realized that ev- all
of that is project dependent or

861
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:54,897
client

862
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:56,593
dependent, right? Like, you
really need to- to match with-

863
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:58,288
with the

864
00:31:58,288 --> 00:32:00,313
client -- the right clients,
and, yeah, to have the ability

865
00:32:00,313 --> 00:32:02,338
to-

866
00:32:02,608 --> 00:32:03,928
to be as flexible as I want to
be and things like that, which

867
00:32:03,928 --> 00:32:05,248
of

868
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:11,878
course they could offer. So it's
going ... well [chuckles]. Yeah.

869
00:32:11,939 --> 00:32:13,558
Still not sure what I wanna do.
I'm just around doing [laughs]

870
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:15,028
programming.

871
00:32:15,693 --> 00:32:16,324
Bekah: Same.

872
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Bogdan: Yeah [laughs].

873
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:22,557
Dan: Oh man. I- I actually
wanted to swing back to sort of

874
00:32:22,557 --> 00:32:24,987
change topics, but, you were
talking about teaching, I

875
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:28,856
think, when you were doing your
master's, right? And you made a

876
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:32,027
joke about teaching -- you're
basically teaching people how to

877
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:36,404
Google. But I- I wa- like, I
feel like ... that's ... that it

878
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:40,781
[clear throat] excuse me.

879
00:32:40,781 --> 00:32:41,981
Maybe that- that's not what you
expect from a professor, but

880
00:32:41,981 --> 00:32:43,181
like, that

881
00:32:43,182 --> 00:32:44,441
is like the right way to learn
[chuckles] -- that's what we try

882
00:32:44,441 --> 00:32:45,700
to teach

883
00:32:45,701 --> 00:32:49,076
everybody. Not profess- like,
whatever. I don't know what you

884
00:32:49,076 --> 00:32:52,451
...

885
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:56,666
amateur teach? I- I don't know
[laughs].

886
00:32:56,922 --> 00:32:57,761
Bogdan: No, no, no. For sure. I
know what you mean. Yeah.

887
00:32:57,807 --> 00:32:58,721
Dan: Like the ... you know? But
when I'm trying to help somebody

888
00:32:58,721 --> 00:32:59,635
learn,

889
00:32:59,636 --> 00:33:00,761
you know, one of the- one of
the, like, learning how to

890
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:01,886
Google things and

891
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:03,296
figure things out for yourself
is like one of the biggest

892
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:04,706
skills to

893
00:33:04,707 --> 00:33:08,037
learn when you're becoming a
developer, right? Especially for

894
00:33:08,037 --> 00:33:12,446
the first time. So I just
wondered if you could tell me a

895
00:33:12,446 --> 00:33:14,906
little bit more about like that
experience of teaching in that

896
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:19,346
structured, you know, in a, like
a structured way as a- as a-

897
00:33:19,346 --> 00:33:22,991
as a ... what- what do you call
yourself? A professor? A- a ...

898
00:33:22,991 --> 00:33:24,221
I don't know what the right
term, just --

899
00:33:24,432 --> 00:33:25,211
Bogdan: No. Teaching- teaching-
teaching assistant, whatever.

900
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:26,831
Dan: Teaching assistant. Yeah.
So as a TA, like -- but like,

901
00:33:26,831 --> 00:33:28,240
what -- can you just

902
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:30,476
describe a little bit more about
that? From like -- cuz I've

903
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:32,381
watched

904
00:33:32,382 --> 00:33:36,132
and been on both sides of, you
know, learning from sort of

905
00:33:36,136 --> 00:33:39,432
independent online version,
right? But I don't think

906
00:33:39,432 --> 00:33:42,791
we've had anybody on the podcast
who has, like, taught in that --

907
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:47,201
taught computer science in this
structured way.

908
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:48,386
Bogdan: Yeah, it was -- it- it-
it --

909
00:33:48,432 --> 00:33:49,586
Dan: I know I might be
misremembering this, Bekah, but

910
00:33:49,586 --> 00:33:50,740
[chuckles] ... I'm pretty

911
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:51,000
sure -- so I'd like to hear
about it. Could you just tell me

912
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,781
more about that experience?

913
00:33:53,217 --> 00:33:54,642
Bogdan: No, for sure. But also,
like, they take it with a grain

914
00:33:54,642 --> 00:33:56,067
of

915
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,626
salt. Like, I've been a -- I was
a TA. Like, I was still a

916
00:33:57,626 --> 00:33:59,185
student,

917
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:00,836
right? So I also being --

918
00:34:01,031 --> 00:34:03,102
Dan: Sure, sure. So you- so you
weren't doing the lesson plans

919
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:03,107
and stuff, but-

920
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Bogdan: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

921
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Dan: -still you were -- I- I
just would like to hear about

922
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
it. Cuz it's-

923
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Bogdan: Yeah [laughs].

924
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,500
Dan: -it's like the- the process
of learning this stuff is

925
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,000
endlessly

926
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,641
fascinating to me and ... you
know?

927
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:14,142
Bogdan: It is. I think it's very
... yeah, I think it's -- I

928
00:34:14,142 --> 00:34:15,612
think

929
00:34:15,612 --> 00:34:17,021
education, especially in
computer science is very

930
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,430
fascinating.

931
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,846
Because it's so ... it's so, I
don't know. It's -- yeah.

932
00:34:20,846 --> 00:34:23,261
Anyways, [laughs] we'll

933
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:25,032
get in. Yeah, I think that ac-
actually helped a lot. Like,

934
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:26,802
being

935
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:29,862
a TA helped a lot because I
don't think people have too many

936
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:31,886
[chuckles] expectations, I
think. I don't know. They

937
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:33,910
didn't. I had

938
00:34:33,911 --> 00:34:38,757
great students, two times, cuz
there were two periods. And

939
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:42,116
it was- i-i-it was interesting
cuz the -- that- that- that's

940
00:34:42,116 --> 00:34:45,475
why I think it's very

941
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:50,547
fascinating. Like, we had
different people of different,

942
00:34:50,876 --> 00:34:52,556
like, levels, right? Like it
happened -- they were all in the

943
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,236
first

944
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:55,947
year, most probably. Well, I
think it was first year. Yeah.

945
00:34:55,947 --> 00:34:57,657
But

946
00:34:57,657 --> 00:34:59,157
some of them had some
mathematics experience, some

947
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:00,657
programming,

948
00:35:00,657 --> 00:35:04,947
some none, and things like that,
but they- they all seemed to- to

949
00:35:05,007 --> 00:35:07,319
kind of like get stuck in the
same kind of places, which I

950
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:09,631
think

951
00:35:09,632 --> 00:35:11,521
it's- it's -- I think it's
interesting. Like, I don't- I

952
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:15,572
don't know much about [chuckles]
education. But I think it's very

953
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:19,561
interesting to kind of see how
they deal in different ways

954
00:35:19,802 --> 00:35:22,606
w-with that. And what I used to
do and I thought it was very

955
00:35:22,606 --> 00:35:25,410
funny —

956
00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:27,152
not funny in a mean way [laughs]
— it's just funny to- to just

957
00:35:27,152 --> 00:35:28,862
observe

958
00:35:28,862 --> 00:35:30,721
it. It's just like, s-see how
they deal with it. And then

959
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:32,580
like, let

960
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:34,944
them deal with the -- in the way
of like -- I was like, "Oh,

961
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:37,302
yeah. Look, your

962
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,161
colleague did it that way. Why
don't you like ... go around

963
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:41,020
this way," and

964
00:35:41,021 --> 00:35:44,202
things like that, which I think
it was a nice- it was a nice,

965
00:35:44,202 --> 00:35:46,016
like, not bonding experience,
but kind of in a way of like

966
00:35:46,016 --> 00:35:47,830
level it

967
00:35:47,831 --> 00:35:49,676
down, especially cuz for some
of- some of -- it was in my ear

968
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:51,521
as well.

969
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,894
Like, for some of us, it was so,
so like intimidating to know

970
00:35:53,894 --> 00:35:56,261
that we

971
00:35:56,262 --> 00:35:59,922
had this people in the class
that were, you know, having

972
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:02,231
experienced in programming and
things like that. I don't know

973
00:36:02,231 --> 00:36:04,156
why. Cuz this is -- it's never a
competition [chuckles], right?

974
00:36:04,156 --> 00:36:06,081
But it

975
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,446
was just weird. It was like, "Oh
my god. They know everything and

976
00:36:07,446 --> 00:36:08,811
I don't

977
00:36:08,811 --> 00:36:10,341
know nothing [laughs]," and
things like that. And then,

978
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:11,871
yeah, later it

979
00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:15,771
happened for me to be in that
position and, you know, showing

980
00:36:15,771 --> 00:36:17,931
people -- or students, as a TA,
like to ask those stupid

981
00:36:17,931 --> 00:36:20,091
question is

982
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:22,882
very important. And to Google
everything is very

983
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:25,954
important. Cuz I also never
understood ... why it was seen

984
00:36:25,954 --> 00:36:29,021
so f-

985
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:32,891
it- it was not seen as like, you
know, frowned upon. It's just

986
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:36,552
like a thing of like the- the
stigma of like, 'Oh, I need to

987
00:36:36,552 --> 00:36:38,921
know things.' It's just like,
you don't know Java ... words or

988
00:36:38,921 --> 00:36:41,290
whatever, you-

989
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:43,616
you know how to- to think
[laughs], you know? So, yeah. I

990
00:36:43,616 --> 00:36:45,941
think it was very

991
00:36:46,362 --> 00:36:47,681
cul- cultivating for me as well.
And also Googling in front of

992
00:36:47,681 --> 00:36:49,000
people

993
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:50,172
is cool cuz, you know, it's like
--

994
00:36:51,146 --> 00:36:52,106
Dan: Yeah, yeah. So --

995
00:36:52,181 --> 00:36:53,981
Bogdan: I, especially -- I'm-
I'm good at Googling. So [all

996
00:36:53,981 --> 00:36:55,781
laugh] I think, I- I like

997
00:36:55,782 --> 00:36:56,952
to show off my skills as well.

998
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:58,796
Dan: Oh, and it is a skill, you
know? I mean, like, way -- a-and

999
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:00,536
i-it's that --

1000
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:03,836
it's about like crafting the
right, you know, like, figure

1001
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:05,000
out what to Google, you know
what I mean, is- is-

1002
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Bogdan: Yeah. It's hard.

1003
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Dan: -is hard. And- and that's
like -- that's something

1004
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I try to do some- some, you
know, when people ask questions

1005
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:18,056
is if it's something that was an
e-e-easy like ... Google search

1006
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:18,530
for me, I will try to share what
I searched for [chuckles], you

1007
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:18,999
know?

1008
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Bogdan: Yeah. For sure, for
sure. Yeah.

1009
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Dan: Like- like not -- I don't,
like, claim that I knew this

1010
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,396
off the top of my head, you
know, but like, I also wanna

1011
00:37:26,396 --> 00:37:28,031
try to, like -- I don't mean to
do that to be like, "You could

1012
00:37:28,031 --> 00:37:29,666
have

1013
00:37:29,672 --> 00:37:31,000
just Googled this," you know?
You know what I mean? Like-

1014
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Bogdan: Sure.

1015
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,323
Dan: -cuz that's not like --
there's that- that -- anytime

1016
00:37:33,323 --> 00:37:34,646
you're using that

1017
00:37:34,646 --> 00:37:36,633
'just' word, like the word
'just', it's probably a bad,

1018
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:38,620
like a- like a --

1019
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:42,851
you wanna rethink what you're
thinking because the -- I knew

1020
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:44,276
the right terms to search for,
to find that answer, you know

1021
00:37:44,276 --> 00:37:45,551
what I

1022
00:37:45,552 --> 00:37:49,032
mean? But not everybody does.
And, you know, you -- that's

1023
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:51,612
something you learn over time.
And it's- it's an important

1024
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:53,862
skill. With computer science, a
lot of the answers are out

1025
00:37:53,862 --> 00:37:57,000
there ... if you can find them,
you know [chuckles]?

1026
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Bogdan: Yeah.

1027
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,415
Dan: I've also been trying to do
that on- on our- on our stream

1028
00:38:00,415 --> 00:38:02,830
sometimes is- is just

1029
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:06,192
Google things. The same thing,
you know? Cuz we're- we're just

1030
00:38:06,192 --> 00:38:07,632
like learning at -- you know,
Kirk and I are doing that

1031
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:09,072
TypeScript

1032
00:38:09,072 --> 00:38:12,192
Tuesdays and so, I'm learn- Kirk
is mostly teaching, I'm mostly

1033
00:38:12,192 --> 00:38:13,737
learning [chuckles]. But it's
like ... yeah, we just didn't

1034
00:38:13,737 --> 00:38:15,282
know something. So we

1035
00:38:15,282 --> 00:38:17,246
looked it up and there's no -- I
don't feel bad about that

1036
00:38:17,246 --> 00:38:19,210
[chuckles] at all,

1037
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:20,621
you know? And- and nor should I,
you know? I- I think that's a

1038
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:22,031
great ...

1039
00:38:22,061 --> 00:38:25,331
I dunno. That's a great attitude
to have. I- I would

1040
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,302
love to see that as a- as a TA,
you know? Cuz I think it's -- it

1041
00:38:28,811 --> 00:38:30,926
can be easy to -- when you are
... when you're teaching or in

1042
00:38:30,926 --> 00:38:33,041
that

1043
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:35,381
position of like ... I dunno,
teaching somebody [chuckles]. It

1044
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:37,540
could be

1045
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,626
easy to like, wanna ... know the
answers or wanna like -- I, like

1046
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:41,711
-- seem

1047
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:44,411
like, you know the answers so
that people trust you more or

1048
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:45,896
something like — no, not in like
a nefarious way, but just as a

1049
00:38:45,896 --> 00:38:47,381
... as

1050
00:38:47,387 --> 00:38:49,139
like a ... I don't know. For me.
This is my personal speaking.

1051
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:50,891
It-

1052
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:52,406
it's like I- I can fall into
that trap. And I- and I try not

1053
00:38:52,406 --> 00:38:53,921
-- like,

1054
00:38:54,661 --> 00:38:56,578
I- I- I -- it takes effort to,
sometimes for me, to like, not

1055
00:38:56,578 --> 00:38:58,495
do that,

1056
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:00,000
you know [chuckles]?

1057
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Bogdan: Yeah. [Unintelligible].

1058
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,500
Dan: Because I don't, obviously,
know everything and ... I don't

1059
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,000
know.

1060
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Bekah: I think --

1061
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,652
Dan: And it's okay, you know?
It's like --

1062
00:39:05,652 --> 00:39:09,012
Bekah: So much of it is based on
our education, right? Because

1063
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:12,822
like you're tested, and you're
expected to know information,

1064
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:16,452
right? You're not expected to
look up information and find the

1065
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:21,552
answers. And so then going on
through years of doing that,

1066
00:39:21,552 --> 00:39:23,786
there's -- it- it feels like
it's not successful to have to

1067
00:39:23,786 --> 00:39:26,020
look

1068
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:29,081
something up like, "Oh, you
failed. You should already know

1069
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:31,076
this." But it's -- that's not
the case, especially with this

1070
00:39:31,076 --> 00:39:33,071
now.

1071
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:37,572
So, you know, it's always how to
find the answer is more

1072
00:39:37,572 --> 00:39:42,222
important. And I read a tweet. I
don't know who tweeted it out,

1073
00:39:42,222 --> 00:39:45,161
but it was like, the difference
between a junior developer and a

1074
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:49,646
senior developer is they're more
effective. Senior developers are

1075
00:39:49,646 --> 00:39:51,000
more effective at Googling. You
just get-

1076
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Bogdan: It's true. For sure.

1077
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,128
Bekah: -faster, you know more
words that you can use, you can

1078
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:58,256
narrow it down more quickly.

1079
00:39:58,317 --> 00:40:00,979
And- and I think that that-
that's ... a lot of what it is

1080
00:40:00,979 --> 00:40:03,641
[chuckles], right? Like,

1081
00:40:03,911 --> 00:40:06,086
knowing what to look for and
what the approach is because you

1082
00:40:06,086 --> 00:40:08,261
ha- you

1083
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:12,612
have to figure it out. And tech
moves too quickly to memorize

1084
00:40:12,672 --> 00:40:15,356
everything that you're doing. So
kn-knowing how to Google and

1085
00:40:15,356 --> 00:40:18,040
knowing

1086
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,576
that that's what's expected of
you, I -- is really important.

1087
00:40:20,576 --> 00:40:23,111
It's a --

1088
00:40:23,112 --> 00:40:27,461
you are should not be asking for
the answers every time you hit a

1089
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:29,201
roadblock. You should be looking
things up and figuring out how

1090
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:30,941
to

1091
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:33,851
do them. And that's, Nick and I
-- Nick Taylor and I did a Lunch

1092
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:36,056
and Learn ... last week? Where
we kind of talked about like,

1093
00:40:36,056 --> 00:40:38,261
what do you

1094
00:40:38,262 --> 00:40:40,632
do? How do you navigate those
challenges? How do you ask

1095
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:44,052
questions? That kind of thing.
Cuz it's important.

1096
00:40:44,097 --> 00:40:46,091
Bogdan: Yeah, it is. I- I- I,
yeah. I think that's great, the-

1097
00:40:46,091 --> 00:40:48,085
the- the

1098
00:40:48,086 --> 00:40:51,086
way you put it. Because I find
-- so what I think about is

1099
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:53,157
[unintelligible] that [chuckles]
I find, with all due respect and

1100
00:40:53,157 --> 00:40:55,197
love for my parents,

1101
00:40:55,197 --> 00:40:58,246
for example, that call me every
time their phone doesn't work,

1102
00:40:58,246 --> 00:41:00,987
right? And I'm thinking about
this. Cuz it's like, look, what

1103
00:41:00,987 --> 00:41:02,809
I'm doing is just goo- I don't
know your phone by heart, you

1104
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:04,631
know?

1105
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:06,791
You -- they also have Android
phone [laughs]. So, I'm like --

1106
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:08,831
no, I'm not saying it is

1107
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:11,862
a weird thing. I just like, I
didn't use an Android for eight

1108
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:13,184
years now. I'm like -- I'm not
gonna- I'm not gonna know what

1109
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:14,501
you do-

1110
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:16,197
what do you have to press. I'm
just gonna Google it and things

1111
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:17,262
like

1112
00:41:17,262 --> 00:41:22,061
that. But then I kind of took
one step back and realized like

1113
00:41:22,152 --> 00:41:25,211
what- what happened with me at
least? And I don't know, I'm not

1114
00:41:25,211 --> 00:41:27,071
sure for how many other, like,
people Eastern Europeans

1115
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:28,931
[chuckles], is that

1116
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:30,941
relatable? Not the Eastern
Europeans. Everybody that

1117
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:32,951
doesn't

1118
00:41:33,431 --> 00:41:35,051
speak natively English, I
believe. Like, we didn't -- I

1119
00:41:35,051 --> 00:41:36,671
didn't have a

1120
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:38,737
computer for a very long time,
right? And when I had it f-for

1121
00:41:38,737 --> 00:41:40,797
the

1122
00:41:40,797 --> 00:41:44,007
first time, I was young -- still
young, but like, I didn't know

1123
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:45,806
English. But [chuckles] until
once I started to learn English,

1124
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:47,605
I realized how

1125
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:50,967
much -- how many things you can
Google, and how many YouTube

1126
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,007
videos you can watch. It was
insane [laughs]. It was like

1127
00:41:53,007 --> 00:41:55,047
the- the

1128
00:41:55,047 --> 00:41:57,597
whole world open. And finally, I
started to Google everything.

1129
00:41:57,717 --> 00:41:59,231
Like ... even for my mom, like,
I was like, "Hey, do you need

1130
00:41:59,231 --> 00:42:00,745
this?"

1131
00:42:00,746 --> 00:42:03,146
And na, na, na. Yeah. And then,
I think that's a thing.

1132
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,757
Like, I think that's where they-
they- they draw the line,

1133
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:09,222
you know? It's just like ...
navigating the internet to- to

1134
00:42:09,222 --> 00:42:11,546
finances and things like that.
Which of course, it learn --

1135
00:42:11,546 --> 00:42:13,870
i-it's a skill,

1136
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:16,722
right? Like, you have to learn
it. They didn't take the time to

1137
00:42:16,722 --> 00:42:18,492
do it, so that's okay. I'm gonna
do it for them [laughs]. But

1138
00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:20,262
yeah,

1139
00:42:20,382 --> 00:42:23,081
like, I think that's- that's-
that's, yeah. That's like, yeah.

1140
00:42:23,222 --> 00:42:27,282
How- how you're supposed to- to-
to think about things. Like,

1141
00:42:27,282 --> 00:42:30,012
am I supposed to know my phone
by heart? No, of course not. Cuz

1142
00:42:30,012 --> 00:42:32,681
it has ... thousands of menus.

1143
00:42:34,106 --> 00:42:35,111
Bekah: Well, it's not necessary,
you know? Like the other thing.

1144
00:42:35,111 --> 00:42:36,116
We need to --

1145
00:42:36,461 --> 00:42:37,886
Bogdan: Exactly. Why would you
add -- exactly. Yeah. Why would

1146
00:42:37,886 --> 00:42:39,311
you adding

1147
00:42:39,311 --> 00:42:42,034
all of that if you do it once a
year or whatever [chuckles]?

1148
00:42:42,034 --> 00:42:44,757
Which happened

1149
00:42:44,757 --> 00:42:47,007
to me, by the way, about --
talking about phone. I'm sorry

1150
00:42:47,007 --> 00:42:49,257
[laughs]. I was-

1151
00:42:49,257 --> 00:42:51,431
I was coming back from a concert
the other week. And it was like

1152
00:42:51,431 --> 00:42:53,605
a

1153
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:56,471
three hours train ride, and my
phone just froze. And it was- it

1154
00:42:56,471 --> 00:42:59,276
was not

1155
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:02,277
dead, but it was just like, the
screen was open, but I couldn't

1156
00:43:02,277 --> 00:43:04,481
click anything. And I tried to
restarted it the way I know it

1157
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,685
[chuckles] and

1158
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:08,264
things like that. And it didn't
work. And I s- I didn't have

1159
00:43:08,264 --> 00:43:09,842
anything

1160
00:43:09,842 --> 00:43:11,221
on me. Like, all it was just my
phone and my wallet. So I sit on

1161
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:12,600
a

1162
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:15,031
train for three hours doing
nothing. Which was a new

1163
00:43:15,031 --> 00:43:17,461
experience [laughs], you

1164
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:21,211
know? I never- I never get to do
that. Also in the middle of the

1165
00:43:21,211 --> 00:43:23,911
night. But then I got home,
Google it from my laptop, and

1166
00:43:23,911 --> 00:43:27,362
there is a second way to restart
your phone, you know? And that

1167
00:43:27,362 --> 00:43:29,326
worked actually. And I was like,
"Wow, should I know this? I

1168
00:43:29,326 --> 00:43:31,290
don't-

1169
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,251
I don't think so [laughs]."

1170
00:43:32,396 --> 00:43:33,191
Dan: Why didn't you just look it
up on your phone [Dan and Bekah

1171
00:43:33,191 --> 00:43:33,986
chuckle]?

1172
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:36,536
Bogdan: Yeah, exactly. Why,
right? Yeah [laughs]. Exactly.

1173
00:43:36,536 --> 00:43:38,891
Yeah.

1174
00:43:39,356 --> 00:43:39,806
Dan: Yeah.

1175
00:43:40,032 --> 00:43:41,727
Bogdan: Yeah. No, but it was a
nice three hours of ... thinking

1176
00:43:41,727 --> 00:43:43,422
[unintelligible].

1177
00:43:43,422 --> 00:43:44,000
Dan: Wow. So did you like-

1178
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Bekah: It was tough.

1179
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,375
Dan: -did you like, go into
alternate dimensions or

1180
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,750
something [all laugh]? You do a
zen, you know?

1181
00:43:49,751 --> 00:43:53,652
Bogdan: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, it
was weird. I wished- I wished

1182
00:43:53,652 --> 00:43:56,501
people would just sit in the
same, like kind of train

1183
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:59,141
compartment with me, and speak
English, cuz everybody was

1184
00:43:59,141 --> 00:44:01,961
speaking Dutch around me. And I
was like, "Please someone speak

1185
00:44:01,961 --> 00:44:03,611
English. So --" I just- I just
wanted to hear it. I didn't

1186
00:44:03,611 --> 00:44:05,261
[laughs]- I didn't

1187
00:44:05,262 --> 00:44:06,762
wanna talk with them. I just
wanted to hear so I haven't to

1188
00:44:06,762 --> 00:44:08,262
like think

1189
00:44:08,262 --> 00:44:10,000
about ... it's weird. I never
get to do that.

1190
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Bekah: Do you speak Dutch?

1191
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,861
Bogdan: No [laughs]. No, I
don't. So that's why. But yeah,

1192
00:44:13,861 --> 00:44:16,722
I don't -- I never get to- to-
to

1193
00:44:16,726 --> 00:44:18,748
think [chuckles] on my own. I
always have music playing in a

1194
00:44:18,748 --> 00:44:20,770
background or

1195
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:22,152
something. It's very weird.

1196
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,241
Bekah: Yeah. It's interesting
how much time we occupy our

1197
00:44:25,241 --> 00:44:27,071
brains

1198
00:44:27,311 --> 00:44:29,756
constantly. Like there's a- a
need -- I read this book, I --

1199
00:44:29,756 --> 00:44:32,201
"Bored and

1200
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:35,652
Brilliant" maybe? Somebody
recommended it to me. And it was

1201
00:44:35,652 --> 00:44:39,311
really good. Like, your brain
needs time to be able to process

1202
00:44:39,311 --> 00:44:42,031
different things, to be creative
to, you know, like store

1203
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:44,751
knowledge that

1204
00:44:44,757 --> 00:44:47,709
you have accumulated. And I
think that we don't do that. I

1205
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:50,661
mean, I --

1206
00:44:50,961 --> 00:44:52,941
like, I'm in the car, I have a
podcast on. I'm going for a run,

1207
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:54,921
I

1208
00:44:54,922 --> 00:44:58,282
have a podcast on. I'm in my
house, I have four kids. Nobody

1209
00:44:58,282 --> 00:45:00,427
[chuckles] ever stops. Like, I
feel like I might be afraid of

1210
00:45:00,427 --> 00:45:02,572
silence at

1211
00:45:02,722 --> 00:45:04,746
this point. Like, what- what
will happen if I spend 10

1212
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:06,770
minutes

1213
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:08,661
being silent? Let alone three
hours. Like --

1214
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:10,946
Bogdan: I- I think I am. But I
don't know. I never re- I never-

1215
00:45:10,946 --> 00:45:12,536
I never

1216
00:45:12,536 --> 00:45:15,416
got the time to actually think
about it. I- I bet I am, right?

1217
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:17,216
Like, I can -- I should be able
to go on a walk and not listen

1218
00:45:17,216 --> 00:45:19,016
to

1219
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:21,044
music, right? Like, that's-
that's what I was sup- but I

1220
00:45:21,044 --> 00:45:23,067
can't, and I

1221
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:26,277
think it's weird. Like, I- I
don't know. It's a very weird

1222
00:45:26,282 --> 00:45:27,297
thing. And I don't wanna ... I
don't know.

1223
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:28,183
Dan: Yeah. I have the same
thing. I have- I have

1224
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,035
[unintelligible] --

1225
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,011
Bekah: So none of us up
meditating then, we're not

1226
00:45:30,011 --> 00:45:30,896
[chuckles], like --

1227
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:31,586
Dan: Oh god.

1228
00:45:31,766 --> 00:45:32,786
Bogdan: No way. There's no way
it's gonna work. Tr- [chuckles]

1229
00:45:32,786 --> 00:45:33,806
yeah. Try [unintelligible] --

1230
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:37,467
Dan: I ... yeah. No, I have the
-- so I have the AirPods Pro,

1231
00:45:37,467 --> 00:45:39,567
and so like

1232
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:40,991
to push play, you- you squeeze
the thing that sticks down, you

1233
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,415
know?

1234
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:45,972
And the other day I walked outta
my office and I didn't have them

1235
00:45:45,972 --> 00:45:47,036
in, but I thought I had them in,
and I squeezed my ear a little

1236
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:48,100
[Dan and Bekah laugh]-

1237
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:50,811
a little, and I'm like, "Well,
that was- that was really

1238
00:45:50,811 --> 00:45:52,481
weird."

1239
00:45:53,277 --> 00:45:53,817
Bogdan: Wow.

1240
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,751
Dan: I'm just so used to having
them in my ears [laughs].

1241
00:45:57,597 --> 00:45:57,597
Bogdan: Wow.

1242
00:45:57,597 --> 00:45:58,000
Bekah: Are you --

1243
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Bogdan: That's embarrassing
[laughs].

1244
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,001
Bekah: So now --

1245
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,036
Dan: Like, yeah. I need to
listen to my podcast for 30

1246
00:46:02,036 --> 00:46:03,072
seconds

1247
00:46:03,077 --> 00:46:04,302
while I go get water. Like --

1248
00:46:04,302 --> 00:46:05,000
Bekah: Yeah.

1249
00:46:05,382 --> 00:46:06,000
Bogdan: Yeah, exactly [laughs].

1250
00:46:05,382 --> 00:46:07,481
Bekah: Yeah. No, it's true!
Yeah.

1251
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:09,431
Bogdan: I do that. Yeah. Or on
the toilet. Like, I- I got to

1252
00:46:09,431 --> 00:46:10,645
going to the toilet. I

1253
00:46:10,646 --> 00:46:14,456
can't just like ... peeing [??].
That's weird.

1254
00:46:15,387 --> 00:46:17,562
Bekah: Yeah. Have to be occupied
[laughs]. I will say it's- it's

1255
00:46:17,562 --> 00:46:19,737
nice weather

1256
00:46:19,737 --> 00:46:22,646
here. Like very spring weather,
and my kids like to swing on the

1257
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,551
swings, and I like to swing on
the swings, and that is like

1258
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:26,456
maybe the

1259
00:46:26,456 --> 00:46:29,016
only time that I can just -- I'm
still, like, moving and ... my

1260
00:46:29,016 --> 00:46:31,576
brother

1261
00:46:31,577 --> 00:46:34,067
was telling me ... I can't
remember. I think it was a

1262
00:46:34,067 --> 00:46:36,227
neurologist that- that was
saying, "To improve your memory,

1263
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:38,387
you

1264
00:46:38,387 --> 00:46:42,106
should try thinking in complete
sentences for like 10 minutes a

1265
00:46:42,106 --> 00:46:43,741
day," or something. And so
[chuckles] the other day I was

1266
00:46:43,741 --> 00:46:45,376
like practicing

1267
00:46:45,376 --> 00:46:47,159
that as I was swinging on the
swing next to my kid, like,

1268
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:48,942
"There

1269
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:50,711
is a tree and the leaves on the
tree are very greenly

1270
00:46:50,711 --> 00:46:52,480
[chuckles]," I didn't

1271
00:46:52,481 --> 00:46:54,011
say it out loud. It was just in
my head [Bogdan laughs], and I'm

1272
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,541
ike, "This is ridiculous."

1273
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:58,061
I never talk in complete
sentences, first of all. But-

1274
00:46:58,061 --> 00:47:00,581
but also, it was really

1275
00:47:00,581 --> 00:47:05,112
hard. I was like, I was shocked
at how much my mind wondered

1276
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:09,132
while I was trying to stay
focused. It was like, "Wait a

1277
00:47:09,132 --> 00:47:11,171
minute." I've just like, "Where
-- how did I get to this to-do

1278
00:47:11,171 --> 00:47:13,210
list

1279
00:47:13,211 --> 00:47:14,501
that I'm rattling off in my
head? Because I was just talking

1280
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:15,791
to

1281
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,592
myself about tree leaves," you
know?

1282
00:47:19,226 --> 00:47:20,651
Bogdan: That's -- that -- like,
yeah. Exactly. The w- the way

1283
00:47:20,651 --> 00:47:22,076
the brain

1284
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:24,206
just like, worked, when- when
you don't do -- like, my -- so

1285
00:47:24,206 --> 00:47:26,306
my- my

1286
00:47:26,306 --> 00:47:27,851
therapist told me, like, when I
used to have this anxiety

1287
00:47:27,851 --> 00:47:29,396
things,

1288
00:47:29,396 --> 00:47:33,447
like, whatever moments, like,
my- my super plan, which I 100%

1289
00:47:33,447 --> 00:47:36,461
thought it- it's working, cuz it
made me feel better, was just

1290
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:38,576
like, if I- if I feel weird,
I'll just like straight up, like

1291
00:47:38,576 --> 00:47:40,691
put on

1292
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:44,351
something ... something that I
can hear and go for a walk, for

1293
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:45,716
example and things like that.
Which turns out it's not good

1294
00:47:45,716 --> 00:47:47,081
[laughs].

1295
00:47:47,771 --> 00:47:51,431
Cuz, no. Cuz at the end, she was
like, "Why don't you just

1296
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:53,749
like ... sit down, and like,
think about what's happening? Or

1297
00:47:53,749 --> 00:47:56,067
like,

1298
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:57,777
let your- your- your mind
understand like what's

1299
00:47:57,777 --> 00:47:59,487
happening,

1300
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,302
and why you feel that way, and
things like that." Which ... I'm

1301
00:48:01,302 --> 00:48:03,117
gonna

1302
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:05,276
give it to her [Bogdan and Bekah
laugh], in a ways. It worked for

1303
00:48:05,276 --> 00:48:07,435
me. In a- in a very weird way.
It's

1304
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:09,663
just like -- but then you start
to, like -- I start to like, you

1305
00:48:09,663 --> 00:48:11,890
know,

1306
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:14,126
like, as you said, like realize,
oh, that's -- those leaves

1307
00:48:14,126 --> 00:48:16,361
there, they're

1308
00:48:16,362 --> 00:48:17,741
actually very nice [chuckles],
you know, and things like that.

1309
00:48:17,741 --> 00:48:19,120
Which-

1310
00:48:19,152 --> 00:48:20,862
which never happens when- when
... yeah. I even, yeah. Like I,

1311
00:48:20,862 --> 00:48:22,572
even

1312
00:48:22,577 --> 00:48:24,509
before sleep, I like to- to- to
do this, and to hear something,

1313
00:48:24,509 --> 00:48:26,441
and

1314
00:48:26,447 --> 00:48:28,954
things like that. I had a- I had
a friend coming into my room.

1315
00:48:28,954 --> 00:48:31,461
And

1316
00:48:31,461 --> 00:48:32,766
I was listening to music, and he
was like, "Do you listen music

1317
00:48:32,766 --> 00:48:34,071
in

1318
00:48:34,072 --> 00:48:36,536
your bed?" I was like, "What
[laughs]? Of course I do. Why

1319
00:48:36,536 --> 00:48:39,000
don't you?"

1320
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,986
And it [Dan chuckles] turns out
not a lot of people do that

1321
00:48:39,986 --> 00:48:40,972
[chuckles].

1322
00:48:42,802 --> 00:48:45,952
Yeah. It's weird. The brain is
weird.

1323
00:48:47,411 --> 00:48:47,802
Bekah: Yeah. I --

1324
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:48,282
Dan: The brain is weird.

1325
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:50,456
Bekah: I mean, I even -- like, I
have a fan running when I'm

1326
00:48:50,456 --> 00:48:51,791
sleeping.

1327
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:54,521
Because I can't ... take the
silence, ever. Ugh, sleeping in

1328
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:57,251
hotels is

1329
00:48:57,257 --> 00:48:59,000
like the- the worst. I hate
sleeping in hotels.

1330
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Bogdan: I hate it. Yeah.

1331
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,500
Bekah: They're so quiet. Or
they're really noisy. We stayed

1332
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,000
in a-

1333
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Dan: Yes.

1334
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,925
Bekah: -hotel this weekend. And
there were people out in the

1335
00:49:04,925 --> 00:49:06,850
hallway until like, 2:00 AM.

1336
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:07,751
Dan: Ugh.

1337
00:49:07,867 --> 00:49:08,246
Bogdan: Oh, no.

1338
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:09,971
Bekah: That wasn't ideal. Cuz
... well, I couldn't understand

1339
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:11,410
what

1340
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:12,778
they were saying because it was
a different language [Bogdan

1341
00:49:12,778 --> 00:49:14,140
chuckles]. So then it

1342
00:49:14,141 --> 00:49:14,411
was like less fine.

1343
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,302
Bogdan: I'm staying with Dutch
[Bekah chuckles]. Well, I --

1344
00:49:16,302 --> 00:49:19,032
Dan: Were they happy? Were they
happy, or they angry, or --

1345
00:49:19,032 --> 00:49:20,322
Bekah: I am --

1346
00:49:20,322 --> 00:49:21,000
Dan: Medium?

1347
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,896
Bekah: I- I'm not sure. I feel
like all of the above. But

1348
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:26,666
at one point there was like,
this wasn't -- this was during

1349
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:28,436
the

1350
00:49:28,436 --> 00:49:33,657
day. There were two young boys,
like wondering down the hallway.

1351
00:49:33,657 --> 00:49:35,052
And you can tell their mom was
the one that came outta the

1352
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:36,447
room,

1353
00:49:36,447 --> 00:49:39,536
because like, she had a total
mom face on. Those kids were not

1354
00:49:39,536 --> 00:49:42,177
supposed to be wondering in the
hallway. And she walked with

1355
00:49:42,177 --> 00:49:44,457
like, "You are in big trouble
[chuckles]." It was like maybe

1356
00:49:44,457 --> 00:49:46,737
my favorite part of

1357
00:49:46,947 --> 00:49:48,161
the entire hotel stay. Like, I
feel you. I've been there [Bekah

1358
00:49:48,161 --> 00:49:49,375
and Bogdan chuckle].

1359
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:52,893
Dan: U-universal- universal
language.

1360
00:49:52,893 --> 00:49:55,000
[Unintelligible][laughs].

1361
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

1362
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:54,431
Bogdan: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[laughs].

1363
00:49:54,431 --> 00:50:01,902
Yeah. I used to -- I- I- I used
to live on a moderately

1364
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:05,231
crowded city -- street, for
Maastricht, I mean, where there

1365
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:07,211
were a bunch of bars, and cafes,
and things like that. And every

1366
00:50:07,217 --> 00:50:09,479
single night, people would ...
fight? But it would fight in

1367
00:50:09,479 --> 00:50:11,741
Dutch,

1368
00:50:11,771 --> 00:50:15,702
which was so frustrating. Cuz I
was so curious. Like, no. Like,

1369
00:50:15,702 --> 00:50:17,742
seriously. They f- they- they
were fighting so mm- first of

1370
00:50:17,742 --> 00:50:19,782
all, so

1371
00:50:19,782 --> 00:50:21,806
long. Like, you know, you- you-
you scream at each other for a

1372
00:50:21,806 --> 00:50:23,830
few seconds [chuckles]

1373
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:25,931
and it go -- but they were
fighting for so long, and every

1374
00:50:25,931 --> 00:50:28,226
single night I was so -- that
was my main motivation to learn

1375
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:30,521
Dutch [laughs]. Just

1376
00:50:30,521 --> 00:50:33,402
to understand what- what are
they fighting about? What is --

1377
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:33,972
Dan: To understand the drama
[chuckles]?

1378
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:35,000
Bogdan: Yeah. Like, exactly.
Like [chuckles] --

1379
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Dan: All of that.

1380
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,131
Bogdan: Yeah. But then I moved.
So I don't have that excitement

1381
00:50:37,131 --> 00:50:38,262
in my life anymore.

1382
00:50:40,077 --> 00:50:41,607
Bekah: I feel like I would be
tempted to record it. And then

1383
00:50:41,607 --> 00:50:43,137
trying and get

1384
00:50:43,137 --> 00:50:43,827
it translated [laughs].

1385
00:50:44,322 --> 00:50:45,626
Bogdan: Translate it after
[laughs]? Never do that. Maybe I

1386
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,930
should [chuckles].

1387
00:50:49,061 --> 00:50:51,161
I tried that with the doctor's
office a bunch of times

1388
00:50:51,161 --> 00:50:53,981
when they have the number
pressing things, but it didn't

1389
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:54,851
work that well.

1390
00:50:55,947 --> 00:50:56,817
Bekah: Ugh. That's frustrating.

1391
00:50:57,222 --> 00:50:57,851
Bogdan: Robot voices, maybe. I
dunno [chuckles]. Yeah.

1392
00:50:59,943 --> 00:51:04,653
Bekah: Okay. So, you've kind of
like, navigated all over this

1393
00:51:04,653 --> 00:51:07,954
career path. I feel like you've
done a lot of different things

1394
00:51:07,954 --> 00:51:11,914
and have a lot of knowledge. And
it seems like you're on a

1395
00:51:11,914 --> 00:51:15,146
path that you're enjoying now.
What advice do you have for

1396
00:51:15,146 --> 00:51:18,378
anybody

1397
00:51:18,378 --> 00:51:19,923
else that's kind of like
navigating where they wanna go?

1398
00:51:19,923 --> 00:51:21,468
I

1399
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:24,708
especially think like, there's
so many people coming into tech

1400
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:27,513
right now. And I think that
there's this focus on ... you

1401
00:51:27,513 --> 00:51:30,318
have

1402
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:32,973
to do this one thing. Like, you
have to do wh-whatever program

1403
00:51:32,973 --> 00:51:35,628
or

1404
00:51:35,628 --> 00:51:38,599
whatever self-taught path you
went on, but there are a lot of

1405
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:41,516
different jobs in tech, you
know? So, what advice — like,

1406
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:44,433
based on

1407
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,224
your journey — would you give to
people who are like doing that

1408
00:51:47,224 --> 00:51:49,173
exploration and trying to break
in right now?

1409
00:51:50,978 --> 00:51:54,369
Bogdan: So, I mean ... without
adding to the gatekeeping, cuz

1410
00:51:54,373 --> 00:51:56,095
you know, everybody -- I feel
like, we all have our ways and

1411
00:51:56,095 --> 00:51:57,817
things

1412
00:51:57,818 --> 00:52:00,909
like that. I'm not gatekeeping
it, but I can- I can talk about

1413
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,933
like what worked and -- which is
very tricky as well. Cuz I was-

1414
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:04,957
I

1415
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:06,728
was actually talking a few days
ago with someone -- with a

1416
00:52:06,728 --> 00:52:08,498
person

1417
00:52:08,498 --> 00:52:11,708
that also just started — switch
from physics to computer science

1418
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:16,454
and now they got an internship.
And I think it's hard. I --

1419
00:52:16,454 --> 00:52:17,714
it's hard for me to be in that
position. And also, I think I

1420
00:52:17,714 --> 00:52:18,974
ask

1421
00:52:18,974 --> 00:52:24,014
a question about this the other
day at Virtual Coffee.

1422
00:52:24,043 --> 00:52:28,724
Because I- I still feel like,
everything is so overwhelming

1423
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:33,313
already, and it's so hard to
find ways to do things. Like, me

1424
00:52:33,313 --> 00:52:35,893
chipping in with [laughs] things
would add to that. But I mean,

1425
00:52:35,893 --> 00:52:38,473
it's- it's-

1426
00:52:38,478 --> 00:52:42,853
it's very interesting. So like
my- my- my advice in

1427
00:52:42,858 --> 00:52:45,408
that regard was -- what I was
thinking at the moment ... based

1428
00:52:45,408 --> 00:52:47,958
on

1429
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:50,365
my school experience and my jobs
that I had on the way ... is --

1430
00:52:50,365 --> 00:52:52,772
and

1431
00:52:52,773 --> 00:52:54,828
I'm not sure exactly [chuckles]
how valid it is -- not valid.

1432
00:52:54,828 --> 00:52:56,883
It's just like, we-

1433
00:52:57,034 --> 00:52:58,203
we already have arguments about
this, right? Like, the way --

1434
00:52:58,203 --> 00:52:59,372
the

1435
00:52:59,373 --> 00:53:00,873
right way to start to- to learn
programming and things like

1436
00:53:00,873 --> 00:53:02,373
that.

1437
00:53:02,373 --> 00:53:05,284
Oh, should you learn ... React,
although you don't know

1438
00:53:05,284 --> 00:53:08,403
JavaScript or whatever. But what
I- what I find very interesting

1439
00:53:08,403 --> 00:53:10,308
about my- my experience is that
I spent so much time trying to

1440
00:53:10,308 --> 00:53:12,213
learn

1441
00:53:12,813 --> 00:53:14,478
things -- fundamental things,
which of course are very

1442
00:53:14,478 --> 00:53:16,143
important. I'm

1443
00:53:16,143 --> 00:53:18,528
not gonna argue that, will helps
us in- in- in many, many ways

1444
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,913
to- to do our

1445
00:53:20,918 --> 00:53:25,443
day jobs, but I didn't have time
to- to focus, you know, like

1446
00:53:25,443 --> 00:53:27,768
profess- not professionally, but
like academically ... on things

1447
00:53:27,768 --> 00:53:30,093
that

1448
00:53:30,099 --> 00:53:32,691
I'm actually using at my job.
So, look. You do need Java- you

1449
00:53:32,691 --> 00:53:35,283
do-

1450
00:53:35,434 --> 00:53:38,403
you do need to know- to know
JavaScript to- to- to work in

1451
00:53:38,403 --> 00:53:40,594
React and things like that. But
if you spend too much time on

1452
00:53:40,594 --> 00:53:42,409
that, you'll never --
y-y-you'll- you'll get a little

1453
00:53:42,409 --> 00:53:44,224
bit later to these

1454
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:46,444
things. And y-y-you might, as I
did it with electrical

1455
00:53:46,444 --> 00:53:48,664
engineering, I-

1456
00:53:48,664 --> 00:53:51,784
I- I missed- I missed the
opportunity to get excited about

1457
00:53:51,784 --> 00:53:56,974
it. So I feel like, if we would
spend so much time on learning

1458
00:53:56,974 --> 00:53:58,961
the basis of- of JavaScript, and
this is not [chuckles]

1459
00:53:58,961 --> 00:54:00,948
advocating me -- this is not me

1460
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:03,123
advocating for people not to
[laughs] learn the basics. I'm

1461
00:54:03,123 --> 00:54:05,297
just saying like, the

1462
00:54:05,298 --> 00:54:07,658
division of time is very
important. So, I think ...

1463
00:54:07,658 --> 00:54:10,018
do-doing --

1464
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:12,498
mainly doing ... I don't know.
For example, frameworks, and

1465
00:54:12,498 --> 00:54:14,748
then

1466
00:54:15,438 --> 00:54:19,458
picking up as a hobby or as a
second thing, learning the

1467
00:54:19,518 --> 00:54:21,806
fundamentals that you don't know
... would accelerate it a little

1468
00:54:21,806 --> 00:54:24,094
bit

1469
00:54:24,423 --> 00:54:25,758
more. In the way of -- cuz at
the end of the day, as- as, you

1470
00:54:25,758 --> 00:54:27,093
know, as

1471
00:54:27,094 --> 00:54:28,998
developers, as engineers, we
have to- to find solutions and

1472
00:54:28,998 --> 00:54:30,902
to

1473
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:34,954
build things, right? And we're
gonna- we're gonna, eventually,

1474
00:54:35,264 --> 00:54:37,524
in wha- in some setups, you- you
get paid [chuckles] to- to use

1475
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,784
the best tools you

1476
00:54:39,784 --> 00:54:42,206
have to build the best things
you can build. And ... how you

1477
00:54:42,206 --> 00:54:44,628
get

1478
00:54:44,634 --> 00:54:46,221
there, like the- the tools you
use to get there, I feel like

1479
00:54:46,221 --> 00:54:47,808
they're

1480
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:51,559
more important than the things
that I spent a lot of time

1481
00:54:51,739 --> 00:54:55,909
learning in, you know, all these
formal setups, which was great.

1482
00:54:55,909 --> 00:54:57,484
I'm not [chuckles] denying that.
But I just thinking out loud. I

1483
00:54:57,484 --> 00:54:59,059
think that

1484
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:02,210
was the things focusing on
tools, and then learning the-

1485
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:05,357
the- the basics

1486
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:07,488
and fundamentals as- as we go.
Cuz I think that would help us,

1487
00:55:07,488 --> 00:55:09,618
you

1488
00:55:09,623 --> 00:55:12,103
know, get a little bit more
creative [chuckles]. I think. I

1489
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:14,583
dunno. I

1490
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:16,428
dunno if it makes sense
[laughs]. But that's what I was

1491
00:55:16,428 --> 00:55:18,273
thinking about

1492
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:18,724
the other day.

1493
00:55:19,548 --> 00:55:20,868
Bekah: No, I think that makes
total sense. And I think that's

1494
00:55:20,868 --> 00:55:22,188
