00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,019
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 6, Episode 2 of the

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,130
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,789
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:21,879
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,789
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:27,820
stories and what they've learned.
And we are here to share it with

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,359
you. Here with me today is my
co-host, Dan.

8
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,299
Dan Ott: Hello! How is it going,
Bekah?

9
00:00:34,914 --> 00:00:36,994
Bekah: It is going fabulous.

10
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:39,465
Dan: That's so much less
satisfying to say than "Waddup,

11
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:41,664
Bek." [Bekah laughs] I think I'm just gonna
start saying that in every episode [laughs].

12
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:43,884
Bekah: Fine. It's fine. That's
cool.

13
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:49,314
Dan: Anyway ... yes. Today we
have another, you know,

14
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:51,984
awesome, obviously, guest.
Bogdan --

15
00:00:52,164 --> 00:00:54,325
Bekah: The theme- theme for
Season 6 is awesomeness.

16
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:56,000
Dan: Yes. And really, for all
seasons, honestly.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000 
Bekah: [Singing] Every
[unintelligible].

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,354
Dan: But yeah, we have Bogdan Covrig
here. He is a software developer from The

19
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:08,394
Netherlands, and he ... I don't
know. Yeah, he- he -- it was really

20
00:01:08,394 --> 00:01:11,754
great to have him around [??], he-
he just finished school, like last

21
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:14,754
year, sometime, right? Or this
year? Last year? I don't know.

22
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:15,265
Recently. In ... The ...
Nether- ... lands --

23
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,319
Bekah: Time has not exist over
the last two years. So --

24
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:21,715
Dan: Right? Yeah, yeah. No, I
have no idea. But he talks

25
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,424
about that. He talks about
experience in school, go

26
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:27,055
through school, and- and then,
you know, his experiences as

27
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:29,905
developer, and, it was really fun.
Really- really good talking to him.

28
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:34,105
Bekah: It's always interesting
to think about the journeys that

29
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:38,694
people take to get them to the
roles that they're in. And so I

30
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:42,295
think Bogdan is one of the first
people, or one of the few people

31
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:47,140
that we've talked to who's been
an educator, as in like, in a

32
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,000
university setting, teaching
people about coding.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Dan: Yeah.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,010
Bekah: And to hear what that was like and
what he learned from that experience that

35
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:57,760
brought him to where he is right now.

36
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:02,515
Dan: Yeah, totally. I mean, I was
very curious to hear about that.

37
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:07,135
And I did some computer science
in- in- in school, and in college,

38
00:02:07,704 --> 00:02:11,425
and it was a long time ago. And
... I don't know, I was curious

39
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:14,275
to see -- hear about -- I'm also
just curious to hear about what it's

40
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:17,830
like in a classroom right now as
a developer, as, you know, in a-

41
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,159
in a college classroom, as opposed
to bootcamps, and things like

42
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:26,349
that. And, yeah. And- and also
... I don't know. The idea of

43
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,870
teaching is just like, so beyond
anything I've ever done, like,

44
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,479
you know, teaching at semesters
of worth of classes, you know?

45
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:35,560
I -- although, I don't know. I was curious
about it and so it was really nice to

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,159
hear about it from- from- from
Bogdan.

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,240
Bekah: Yeah. And to hear the process
that he went through as he was

48
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,919
trying to figure out like what's
next for him in his career path.

49
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,710
And we start every episode of
this podcast like we start every

50
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,800
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

51
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,180
we're from, what we do, and a
random check-in question. So, we

52
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:09,955
hope you enjoy this episode.
Today's random check-in question

53
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:15,955
is, what is your favorite
condiment? My name is Bekah. I'm

54
00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:20,846
a technical community builder,
and my favorite condiment is hot

55
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,885
sauce. Definitely. That goes
on everything.

56
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:28,945
Dan: That's a good one. Yeah.
All right. Hi, I'm Dan. I do web

57
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:33,586
development in Cleveland. I-
I don't have a super favorite.

58
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:39,836
I- I'd say -- so there's this taco
place in ... near where I live,

59
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:44,366
called ... what -- Bombas.
And they -- so when you

60
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:47,786
could -- they have this like sauce.
And you can -- when you order like

61
00:03:47,786 --> 00:03:50,545
a taco box to go, you know, like
this, like a family box or

62
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:53,605
whatever, they'll give you just
like a whole- like a whole thing

63
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:55,000
of it, a whole like bottle of it.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Bekah: Yes.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,406
Dan: And I -- when we do that, I- I use it for like
the next two weeks and -- on like everything. So I- I

66
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:03,626
can't really describe it. I think --
it has garlic in it, certainly. I

67
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:06,566
don't -- it may be some sort of
aioli maybe. I don't- I don't

68
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:08,725
actually know, and I don't
really wa-

69
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:09,596
Bekah: Is it spicy? No, it's
not spicy.

70
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,000
Dan: No, it's not- it's not
spicy.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Bekah: Creamy?

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,380
Dan: You kn- yeah, it's a little creamy, I guess. Although
saying creamy makes it sound weird [chuckles]. I dunno [laughs].

73
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,790
But- but it's good. And I, like,
I don't wanna know really. I like

74
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,190
the mystery of it, you know what I mean?
It's just like this magical thing that

75
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,800
shows up, and then it goes away,
and then a couple months later

76
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:29,380+
we'll order, you know, those
tacos again, and it'll be back to

77
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:32,531
my life. I don't wanna have
the mys- like, maybe it's just

78
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:35,471
some chunky thing that they buy
off -- it probably is [chuckles]

79
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:37,690
something that I could just buy
at the grocery store, you know?

80
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:38,680
But I don't wanna know. It was --

81
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,485
Bekah: Is it like mayonnaisy?

82
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:43,240
Dan: I don't know. It's-

83
00:04:43,255 --> 00:04:44,185
Bekah: Does it need refrigerated?

84
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:47,350
Dan: -meal [chuckles]. I mean, I put it in
the refrigerator. I don't -- I assume. I

85
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,341
don't- I don't ... I don't know. Why
would you have an open bottle of

86
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:53,290
some sort of sauce that you
didn't put in the refrigerator?

87
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:55,615
Bekah: Hot sauce doesn't go in
the refrigerator.

88
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,040
Dan: It doesn't? We keep ours --

89
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:58,286
Bogdan Covrig: Some do. I feel
like some do, right?

90
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:02,290
Dan: Yeah. I don't- I don't know. Well,
like Tabasco. Do you put Tabasco in

91
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:02,471
the --

92
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:03,000
Bekah: You need it to hive [??] --
No. I don't think it needs to be-

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Bogdan: I do [??]. 

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Dan: Really?

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,735
Bekah: -there's a lot of vinegar in it
and that doesn't need to be refrigerated.

96
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:10,555
Dan: Huh. We had these refrigerator
talks before. I- I don't know the

97
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:12,685
rules. So I just assume
everything goes in because it

98
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:13,646
seems safer to me [Bogdan chuckles]-

99
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:15,415
Bekah: Tomatoes do not go in the
refrigerator. They still do not.

100
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:18,045
Dan: -you know? Right. This is what I'm
saying. I don't -- I- I know -- I- I

101
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,096
don't have the knowledge to argue
with you about it. But I just put

102
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:22,346
things in the fridge because that
always seems like the safer

103
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:24,026
option, you know what I mean?
To me.

104
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,831
Bogdan: Do you- do you
put your oil in the fridge?

105
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:27,805
Dan: No.

106
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:27,805
Bekah: No.

107
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:28,391
Bogdan: Yeah. That would be weird.

108
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:31,045
Dan: No, no. All right. Yeah, that-
that'd be weird. I actually had a

109
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:35,485
friend ... Emily's
brother actually, like, got in

110
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:39,386
the habit of keeping his cereal,
like in the fridge. Because he- he

111
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:42,956
said it- it kept it -- like, it would
not go stale as- as fast, you know?

112
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:43,000
It would stay fresh longer.

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Bekah: How long do you keep
this cereal [chuckles]?

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,115
Dan: I don't know. I mean, he's just like liv- living alone,
you know? And like ... I don't know. But like, we went on

115
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,115
vacation altogether at this little
cottage with this tiny fridge, and

116
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:57,836
the whole fridge was full of cereal
[laughs]. We were like, "No, this is

117
00:05:57,836 --> 00:06:01,225
not like -- this is not a -- this
is not -- we're putting this in the

118
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:07,151
cabinet." That's where I draw the
line. Cereal, doesn't go in the fridge.

119
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:09,415
Bekah: That's -- I'm glad [chuckles]
you draw the line there.

120
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:12,281
Dan: Oil? Yeah. Yeah -- no. I- I
knew -- I know enough not to put

121
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:16,091
oil in the fridge. Other than
that, I'll put things in the

122
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:18,701
fridge, and then sometimes Emily
will say, "Hey, that doesn't go in

123
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:22,540
the fridge, dummy." And I'm like, "Okay
[chuckles]. Fair enough." But this

124
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,911
sauce, I don't wanna know whether
it does or not, you know what I

125
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:26,620
mean? Cuz I don't wanna know
anything about it. That's my

126
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,180
point. So I'm just putting it
in the fridge.

127
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:29,935
Bekah: You don't wanna know about
it. That's weird.

128
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:32,711
Dan: Hey, it's a mystery. No, I like
it. I like -- it tastes [crosstalk]

129
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:37,000
very good. I feel like if I learn
about it something will -- it'll

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,680
become less good [laughs].

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Bekah: I don't like the [unintelligible].

132
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:41,124
Bogdan: Or you'll be- you'll
be disgusted by it.

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Bekah: Alright, Bogdan [laughs] --

134
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,538
Dan: But, I mean, that is- that is
a very serious -- that, I mean, that

135
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:47,459
is an actual possibility too. I don't- I don't want
that to happen either [laughs]. Alright, I'm done.

136
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:55,588
Bogdan: Okay. Hello, everybody.
I am Bogdan. I'm from

137
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:59,999
Romania, but I am a software
engineer in The Netherlands. I've

138
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:03,869
been living here for almost five
years, moved from a tiny city in

139
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:07,738
Romania to a tiny [chuckles] city
in The Netherlands. And I like it.

140
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:13,053
And I don't wanna leave. And
I think -- I were talking about

141
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:15,084
sauces -- sauce or condiments?

142
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:20,848
Bekah: Well, I consider some
sauce as a condiment, so --

143
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:21,238
Bogdan: Okay.

144
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:22,139
Dan: Oh, oh, well, like, pasta
sauces are not condiment, right?

145
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:23,399
Bogdan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get
it.

146
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:25,439
Bekah: Yeah. Pasta sauce, it
doesn't count --

147
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:29,728
Bogdan: No, no, no, I get it. I was
just -- yeah. Cuz one of the best

148
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:33,119
thing that I discovered and
absolutely changed my life, my

149
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:38,084
friends got me like this jar
of Chipotle pepper or whatever.

150
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:41,053
I don't know how it works. I
don't know how -- it's- it's just

151
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:45,103
amazing. Cuz then I put it in absolutely
[chuckles] everything. I mean,

152
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:46,000
not everything.

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Dan: Nice.

154
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,000
Bogdan: Ev- like everything that goes with
like tomato sauce or tomatoes, I just-

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Dan: Yeah.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,004
Bogdan: -pour some of those and it's just amazing.
Like the smokey, everything. So, yeah. But

157
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:57,524
otherwise, it's got -- like, usually
it's got like garlic goes into

158
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:59,653
everything, and then --

159
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,033
Dan: I mean, garlic's delicious.
Yeah.

160
00:08:01,244 --> 00:08:03,793
Bogdan: Yeah. And smoked paprika
also. Like, if there's something

161
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:07,514
that needs to be sp- I don't know,
smoked stuff, it's amazing. And

162
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:08,593
garlic as well. So, yeah.

163
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:12,913
Dan: I like it. I almost said-
I almost said --

164
00:08:12,913 --> 00:08:15,764
Bekah: I think all those things in
a sauce together would be great.

165
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:15,764
Dan: Yeah.

166
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:18,913
Bogdan: I think, yeah. But I
have -- I- I mean, I have to agree,

167
00:08:18,913 --> 00:08:23,533
like, with Dan's friend, like
living alone, like, it just --

168
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:28,559
there's -- there are no rules. I ... you know?
[Bogdan and Dan Laugh] I do what I want. I put

169
00:08:28,564 --> 00:08:31,468
everything where I want. And also,
I'm the only one that needs to

170
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:34,000
know where it's placed. So, yeah.
I don't put my --

171
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:39,014
Bekah: So, do- do you put your Chipotle
condiment in the refrigerator?

172
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:44,548
Bogdan: I do. But I'm not sure if
I have- have to? I don't think it's

173
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:49,139
forbidden, right [laughs]? But I just -- I-
I- I was just -- it keeps me sane. Cuz I

174
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:53,849
had to -- I had a tiny Tabasco
bottles, but like, I feel like the

175
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:58,619
vinegar goes up, and then I try to
shake it, and it doesn't, and then

176
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:01,828
it's all-y vinegary, and I don't
like it. So I keep it in the fridge,

177
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:02,000
just to be sure.

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Dan: Mm-hmm.

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,509
Bekah: That's interesting [crosstalk].
I should try that experiment.

180
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,144
Bogdan: But I dunno. I dunno. But no,
tomatoes don't go into fridge. Like, I'm --

181
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:14,173
it's just nuts. It's the way it
is, my friends [laughs].

182
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,589
Bekah: Yes -- no, 100% agree
with you.

183
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:17,984
Bogdan: Yeah.

184
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:22,198
Bekah: Well, thanks for being
with us here today, Bogdan. And

185
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:27,839
we like to start every podcast
episode with your origin story.

186
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,198
So, talk to us a little bit about
how you got into tech.

187
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:35,533
Bogdan: Okay. Thank you for
having me. I just -- I- I mean, I

188
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:40,364
want to start with, like, I
think it's very unfair how clear

189
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:46,364
Dan sound- sounds compared to the two of us,
Bekah. Cuz do you -- do -- you don't post it

190
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:50,173
like this. You don't sound that cool in the
actual [laughs] talk, I see [??]. Like, there's

191
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,874
some mixing going on, right?

192
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:54,808
Dan: What. Wait. Are you saying --

193
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:55,964
Bogdan: You s- you sound very cool.

194
00:09:56,548 --> 00:09:56,818
Dan: Oh. No idea.

195
00:09:57,224 --> 00:09:59,624
Bogdan: And I don't. I- I don't
know. But I'm looking at those

196
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:02,864
things moving on the screen, and
he -- yours are ... bigger [laughs].

197
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:07,964
Dan: Well, okay. Well, I
might just be talking louder or

198
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:10,933
having way -- that might be too-
too loud, actually. I wasn't really

199
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,303
looking at it until just now.
This is --

200
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:16,019
Bekah: I think it looks different
on different screens too.

201
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:16,754
Dan: That's probably true too.

202
00:10:16,754--> 00:10:17,009
Bogdan: Ah.

203
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:19,149
Bekah: Like, mine looks very tiny, like
barely -- so- so, okay. If you're listening --

204
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:23,548
Dan: Yeah, yours is probably, honestly,
like [chuckles], I mean, and I try

205
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:27,089
to do this, like I fix this up in
editing later. I try to, right?

206
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:27,479
Bogdan: Yeah.

207
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:30,839
Dan: So, this is like sound engineering
stuff that I've been learning on

208
00:10:30,844 --> 00:10:33,658
the fly since we were started
working the podcast [chuckles]. So I

209
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:36,658
don't, you know, I don't know a
lot about it. But like, the --

210
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:40,589
trying to get those levels, you
know, to where it's close to the

211
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:44,219
edges is usually the best. So,
Bekah is like, I -- yeah, like-

212
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:47,668
like -- what I was saying is you're a
little quiet, still, you know [chuckles]?

213
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:48,839
Bekah: I'm quiet?

214
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:51,808
Dan: A little bit. Not a lot.

215
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:52,558
Bekah: I didn't turn up my sound.
You didn't tell me to.

216
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:56,729
Dan: Well, I didn't really notice
before. And also, in -- so, for those --

217
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:58,499
I don't know if we're gonna cut
this or not, but for people

218
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:02,428
listening, we use Zencastr, and it
doesn't show you these nice level

219
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:06,448
outputs until you're recording,
which is really obnoxious.

220
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:13,124
It's hard to tell. So, I
don't know. But, Bogdan, do you

221
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:16,813
have -- is that the Wave- is that
the Wave:1? Wave:3? [Unintelligible].

222
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:19,000
Bogdan: You are Wave:3.

223
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Dan: Wave:3?

224
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,844
Bogdan: But no, it was a compliment. We
don't have to go into it. It's also very --

225
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:26,354
Dan: Oh, no. [Unintelligible]. I- I just
got- I just got the Wave:3, like, last week-

226
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:27,313
Bogdan: Yeah, I have ... yeah.
It's --

227
00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:29,624
Dan: -and it's like a day getting it set up.
So I can send you some stuff [chuckles].

228
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:32,000
Bogdan: It's ... no, it's Wave:3,
right? It is.

229
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Dan: It looks like it.

230
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,683
Bogdan: Yeah. It's Wave:3. Yeah. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. I like it. It's nice.

231
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,653
Dan: Yeah. I got- I got -- I like it
too. I just got it ... yeah. Two weeks ago.

232
00:11:38,683 --> 00:11:39,703
Or a week and half ago. So ...
I'll send you some stuff.

233
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:44,653
Bogdan: It- it -- yeah. But is- is
your room, like, prepared for this?

234
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:46,000
Dan: No. Nope. It's just --

235
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:48,524
Bogdan: Cuz you sound insanely good. Like,
there's no way mine sounds like this.

236
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:50,000
Bekah: You sound really good.

237
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:52,543
Dan: Yours sounds pretty good. I think
one thing is, you probably could

238
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:56,114
be closer to your mic. That's --
I mean, maybe not. I don't know.

239
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:58,663
When you're -- it's when you're
moving away -- so, like, if I sit

240
00:11:58,663 --> 00:12:01,933
back here, does that sound- that
sounds like noticeably worse?

241
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:02,354
More echo-y -- echo thing?

242
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:02,548
Bogdan: Yeah [Bogdan and Dan laugh].

243
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:07,349
Bekah: So- so for the listeners,
Dan has scooted his seat back about

244
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:08,099
four feet.

245
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:13,453
Dan: All right. Okay, okay. So- so that
was the one thing I- I read about --

246
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:16,484
so they do like- do like the hang
10 like this, you know, or- or

247
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:19,484
whatever. And then that's like
distance from your mouth-

248
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:21,000
Bogdan: Oh, okay. [Unintelligible] move.
Which is [unintelligible].

249
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:22,813
Dan: -to the microphone should be. Right.
And that's- that's hard. Yeah. It's

250
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:26,293
hard not to- it's hard not to
move. But like, that gets you

251
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:28,604
picked up more, but then there's a
bunch of other stuff too, so ... we

252
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:29,000
don't have to get into it on
that.

253
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Bogdan: Maybe we -- yeah.

254
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,543
Dan: Maybe we do a whole episode
on it sometime [laughs].

255
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:34,109
Bogdan: Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry.

256
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:37,063
Bekah: Maybe- maybe a live stream. And
then, the visual will be easier to be seen.

257
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:41,759
Bogdan: Yeah, screen-ish -- screen the
share -- share the screen [laughs]. Yeah.

258
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:47,083
Dan: Okay. Anyway, I don't know
what [crosstalk] you were saying, or

259
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,793
you were talking --

260
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Bogdan: Origin story.

261
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Bekah: Origin story.

262
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,869
Dan: Yes [laughs].

263
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,509
Bogdan: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. We were doing
about origin story. Well, yeah. Yeah. It's

264
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:57,913
very- it's very linear and
r-r-rather boring, but ... yeah. Cuz

265
00:12:57,913 --> 00:13:01,634
I did -- so, in Romania we have high
schools that are very specialized,

266
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:05,114
and I did one of those with
computer science. So I kind of

267
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:10,063
knew I wanted. I- I have -- my
family is mainly like, musicians.

268
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:12,854
A lot of them are trained
musicians, so I didn't wanna do

269
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:17,714
that cuz I thought it's boring, and
[laughs] fired back to me a few years

270
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,024
later. But yeah, I thought it's
boring. So I went straight to

271
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:24,494
like this mathematics computer science
high school. So I- I kind of knew

272
00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:27,134
I wanted to do this. I kind of
hated it at the time as well, you

273
00:13:27,134 --> 00:13:30,703
know? The whole C, C++
things that don't make any sense

274
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:34,244
when you're young and you
just wanna make, what's the

275
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:37,004
rectangle move on the screen,
right? I don't wanna spend my --

276
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:40,543
yeah. Anyways. But yeah, I
graduated that, and then I moved to

277
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:43,514
The Netherlands to do applied
computer science, which was

278
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:48,403
another [chuckles] surprise. Cuz it
was this program of like computer

279
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:51,344
science, of course, but like,
electrical engineering as well,

280
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:55,663
which look -- I could have look it
up and I did look it up. Like, I

281
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:58,453
kind of knew what the program was,
right? But I did -- I wasn't sure

282
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:00,524
if this gonna be a lot of -- I
didn't even know what's

283
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:04,484
electrical engineering and turned out
to be like very ... not cool [laughs].

284
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:08,923
Like, not- no-not toward the field
itself. This is just for me, like in

285
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:12,688
university years. It was -- I was
like, yeah. Still, I wanna make

286
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,038
rectangles move. But then I wa- got
super, super, super lucky in my

287
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:21,208
first year of university, I
think. I got a job — remote

288
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:25,078
job — in Romania for like one of my
friends' father that had this, like

289
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:29,188
e-commerce kind of low key
business, where I got into

290
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:34,889
Node. I did not lie on my
interview, but something made him

291
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,879
think I actually know Node. I-
I did- I did know about Node,

292
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:39,000
right? I was like [laughs] --

293
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,889
Dan: You've- you've heard of
it. Yeah, yeah.

294
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:45,494
Bogdan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cuz I did -- so
I, like, the -- I remember -- so, the very

295
00:14:45,494 --> 00:14:50,384
first thing I did, like, web development
was, back in high school was like

296
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:53,953
this pi- p5.js — which is still
around, they're very much

297
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:59,264
happening — but there was this --
people doing this co-coding

298
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:02,653
train, they were super into it, and
I did like -- they did, like, the

299
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,533
snake, and I did the snake, and
then I wanted to- to do, like-

300
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:11,183
like a multiplayer thing or like
a chat room for it, and I- I-

301
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:15,734
I knew that you can use Node to do
that [laughs]. And that was the only

302
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:19,423
information I had. And I was
like, "Yeah, you can do like,

303
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:21,946
WebsSockets, right?" Yeah. But
anyways, they were- they were-

304
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:25,844
they were very nice to me and
like, they actually hired me, and I

305
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:28,514
learned a lot about like databases,
and Node, and stuff like

306
00:15:28,514 --> 00:15:32,953
that. And then the second year
of university came in when I was

307
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:36,673
actually teaching more
programming. And I finally kind of

308
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:39,344
overlapped the two, and be like,
"Oh, okay, I'm doing this for my

309
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:42,374
job." I'm learning about this, you know,
we're -- even in school, we learned

310
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:46,153
a bit like about testing, and CI/CD,
and things like that. I was like,

311
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:51,524
"Oh, this is actually cool and
useful." So I ... yeah ... tried to

312
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:56,714
[chuckles] finish school, and then [laughs]
continued, then I got a university job like

313
00:15:56,714 --> 00:16:04,859
teaching Java, which was- which was
bad [laughs]. Look, I have this theory

314
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:09,058
and [laughs] I hope I never have to-
to get a teaching job again cuz if

315
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:11,999
I say this. No, I don't. No, it's
not- no, it's not- it's not a hard

316
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:15,149
day. But it's just like, teaching
programming, it's so easy. Cuz

317
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:19,798
you just like -- you just say, like,
"I -- I'm- I'm- I'm gonna show

318
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:22,229
you how to Google." And if they have
questions, you just Google [Dan chuckles]

319
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:25,828
in front of them, and I -- and- and-
and find out things together. Which

320
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:29,188
is nice, you know? They also do --
need to know how to Google. But,

321
00:16:29,193 --> 00:16:32,369
yeah. And then I got an
internship at another university,

322
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:37,798
but for research. And then I
moved here, to another city,

323
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:42,543
while still studying. I did
my internship, I got a full

324
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,413
contract after, but Corona
happened. So I was staying here

325
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:52,354
working full-time while
finishing my- my- my bachelor basic

326
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:59,024
or barely like [chuckles] trying to finish
my- my bachelor. And then I- I --

327
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:02,803
the- the Maastricht University
research position was absolutely

328
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:06,554
amazing. Like, it's -- it was
academia, which was kind of new

329
00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:09,403
to me, cuz I- I always knew I wanna
be in -- a developer, right? Or

330
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,614
an engineer. But I was like,
"Okay, we can combine this," right?

331
00:17:12,618 --> 00:17:15,284
I don't know a- a lot about
research, but I [chuckles] know about

332
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,554
development, so we can definitely
overlap. Cuz it was also like a

333
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:25,499
legal -- kind of legal tech ...
space, where they had a lot of

334
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:29,669
data where they had a lot of ideas
about tech, but they- they did

335
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:32,759
the developers. So, yeah, we kind
of combined it very nice. But

336
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:38,519
things slowly came to an end. And
finally, two months ago I got a

337
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:44,038
new software engineering job,
to a digital creative internet,

338
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:49,469
whatever they call it -- agency, in
The Netherlands. So I plan to- to

339
00:17:50,294 --> 00:17:54,344
stay doing Node, basically. Root Node,
React, TypeScript, things like

340
00:17:54,344 --> 00:18:00,973
that. So, yeah, I think, that's-
that's it. This is today [laughs]. Just

341
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:03,433
recently joined a -- yeah.

342
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:06,209
Bekah: A cool -- you recently
joined ... I'm sorry. I cut you off.

343
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:09,163
Bogdan: Yeah, no. That was it. Just
recently, like two months ago, I

344
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:11,368
think. It was April. So, yeah.

345
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:14,429
Bekah: So I wanna back up a
little bit and ask some questions

346
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:18,659
about the schooling that you've
done. So, it sounds like there was

347
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:22,888
maybe more practical application
than I've seen from universities

348
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:26,219
in the United States, which
computer science degrees have a

349
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:31,558
lot of, like, theoretical
content, algorithms, and that kind

350
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,429
of stuff. Is that- is that
accurate statement or were you

351
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:36,269
doing a lot of that stuff too?

352
00:18:38,278 --> 00:18:42,209
Bogdan: Yeah. We- we were doing that
for sure as well. But yeah, with an

353
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:46,078
eye on electrical engineering and
kind of like -- so, in- in The

354
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:49,169
Netherlands, they have this
system of like universities, what

355
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:53,098
they call universities -- research
universities, which is basically

356
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:57,028
like a college university in- in- the
US as well, right? Where they, you

357
00:18:57,034 --> 00:19:00,479
know, they teach, you know, like a normal
university [laughs]. And they have these

358
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:07,078
things ... this like, just wh-wh-what they
call 'hogeschool' or like 'HBO's, where-

359
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:10,979
where like more professional
schools. In English, they

360
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:14,459
call them Universities of Applied
Sciences, but it's in- in- in

361
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:18,959
Dutch doesn't really go -- it's
not ... really -- I think it -- I- I

362
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:21,148
think it's a university, but
like -- yeah, there's a difference.

363
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:25,858
Here's like more of a -- like a very-
like a very engineering, like kind

364
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:29,894
of applied -- hands on experience.
It's also longer. It's four years

365
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:32,594
instead of three. And you have to
do internships, you have to work

366
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:34,814
with companies, you have to work
with clients, and things like

367
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:37,574
that, which is for people
that wanna do, you know, wanna

368
00:19:37,574 --> 00:19:40,423
get straight to- to work and
things like that. Which goes very

369
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:42,374
well for like, engineering, and
things like that.

370
00:19:43,874 --> 00:19:44,114
Bekah: Yeah. Interesting.

371
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:47,233
Bogdan: So, it was one of those,
you know? Where you- where you

372
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:53,173
have like, more like programming,
but like kind of rather like ... the-

373
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:56,413
the applied part was like more the
electrical part rather than web,

374
00:19:56,534 --> 00:20:00,943
right? Like we didn't- we didn't
learn about web development, but

375
00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:05,054
we did learn about operating systems
or microcontrollers or things that

376
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:07,000
go into electrical engineering
field.

377
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Dan: Did you have to do assembly?

378
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Bogdan: I think I did not-

379
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000 
Dan: Oh, that's good.

380
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,453
Bogdan: -fortunately. No, but we- we
-- it was- it was insane. Like, I

381
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:21,824
absolutely -- it- it- it was insane.
And- and- and we did microcontrols, of

382
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:25,318
course, and all that, like, chip
programming, and things like that,

383
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:29,848
which I absolutely dreaded and I
couldn't wait to be over.

384
00:20:29,848 --> 00:20:32,699
And although it was interesting,
right? Like, operating systems was

385
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:36,868
such an interesting thing, but
it's just like the- the- the

386
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:41,939
whole thing of like patterns,
and ideas, and things you

387
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:47,159
can have in web development, you --
I couldn't have in- in operating

388
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:50,699
systems, you know? You- you can't get
too creative [chuckles] about it. Cuz

389
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:53,608
there are -- especially in
microcontrollers, like, they- they

390
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:57,929
have this- this huge books and
guides about- about them, and you

391
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:00,898
have to know things, and you have
to look for things that are just

392
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:05,009
set, right? Or- or- or, you know, I don't
know enough to- to- to make this [chuckles]

393
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,159
conclusion, but it's still like --
the way I saw it was like, this

394
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,898
is -- I can't- I can't be creative
here, you know? But I

395
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:15,778
finished it anyways. But,
yeah [laughs].

396
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:18,614
Dan: Yeah. No, I- I love that. I
love hearing about that, you know?

397
00:21:18,614 --> 00:21:22,003
And you have used this phrase a few
times when you're telling the story

398
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:25,663
about ... like, I didn't get to
move around boxes or like, you know,

399
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:28,784
move around boxes [Dan and Bogdan chuckles]. And
like, I- I -- and like, it's -- I know that's like a

400
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:31,124
funny way of saying it, but I- I
totally connect with that because

401
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:34,784
that's- that's something that
I personally, like ... I don't

402
00:21:34,784 --> 00:21:37,003
think -- I mean, I never- I never put
it exactly like that, but it's the

403
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:40,784
same thing of that -- the thing
that drew me to programming was

404
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:45,013
the -- was that; was moving around
boxes. Or like doing a thing, like,

405
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:48,584
doing a thing, and then getting to
see it like move or happen or ...

406
00:21:49,663 --> 00:21:52,814
just see it in front of me,
right? And- and while, like

407
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:55,483
academically, some of the more
like the operating -- the lower

408
00:21:55,483 --> 00:22:00,084
level stuff is, you know, interesting,
maybe [chuckles], you know? I lo-

409
00:22:00,314 --> 00:22:03,044
I totally lost my connection to all
of it. Like, I- I -- like -- and I --

410
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:05,653
like I said this before, that's-
that's when I switched majors out of

411
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:09,523
computer sciences was, I was deep
into that- that ... like, section, you

412
00:22:09,523 --> 00:22:11,294
know what I mean? As, you know,
assembling, and I was doing -- I

413
00:22:11,294 --> 00:22:15,223
wasn't ... yeah, I don't know. I don't
think I was -- that semester, had

414
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:20,114
even done anything where I got to like
hit save or compile and see something

415
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:23,503
[chuckles] happen, you know what I
mean? And it- and it was just like --

416
00:22:23,503 --> 00:22:28,753
and I lost my interest, you know?
And I think the -- it seems

417
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:33,104
like you have acknowledged that
in, you know, yourself and use

418
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:35,953
that as — maybe whether it was
consciously or not — use that as

419
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:38,773
like a sort of driving force in-
in finding, you know, your path,

420
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:42,433
and- and like your happiness.
Like, you could have, possibly, and

421
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:45,163
maybe -- I mean, some people, I guess,
could have forced themselves down the

422
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:50,624
line of, you know, the electrical
engineering and gotten a job ... I

423
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:54,614
don't know, soldering things [chuckles] or
something. I dunno [laughs]. But- but-

424
00:22:54,644 --> 00:22:58,064
but, you know, but like you ... I
don't know. It- it's -- I- I just

425
00:22:58,068 --> 00:23:00,104
connect with that. I- I just wanted
to like, kind of highlight that

426
00:23:00,108 --> 00:23:04,423
because it's -- it- it -- finding
what makes you happy in a- in a field

427
00:23:04,423 --> 00:23:06,794
is- is important. Especially com-
field like computer science,

428
00:23:06,794 --> 00:23:11,023
because there are gonna be some
people that ... will get into those

429
00:23:11,054 --> 00:23:13,874
microcontrollers and be totally
hooked, you know? And-

430
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:14,743
Bogdan: Yeah, of course. Some
find it cool [??], right? Yeah.

431
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:17,173
Dan: -some people- some people
not, you know? And ... right. Yeah.

432
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:19,804
No. So, I- I think that's
great.

433
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,638
Bogdan: Yeah, no, for sure. I
mean, I'm not- I'm not- I'm not ...

434
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:26,999
yeah. It's just like -- also, like,
I remember since I was younger

435
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:30,538
from high school, like, people
had a thing for Arduinos, which I

436
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:34,469
think that- I- I think that- I
think that's what -- I think that's

437
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:37,378
why I thought it's gonna be cool.
Cuz like everybody was like, "Oh

438
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:40,888
my god. Arduino. Like, you -- we have
to do this," and things like that. And

439
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:44,699
I'm like, "I do -- okay [chuckles]." I-
I loved it, right? I think it's cool.

440
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:49,328
Like, Raspberry Pi and things like
that is fun. But ... yeah. Yeah. I

441
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:52,058
think, I ... yeah. Like,
there where I agree with you.

442
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:55,568
Like, I need to see immediate
change, and I- I need a reaction

443
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:58,209
from things I'm doing cuz
otherwise, I feel like I spend the

444
00:23:58,209 --> 00:24:00,000
whole day doing nothing. That's
not super-

445
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Dan: Yeah.

446
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,348
Bogdan: -productive [chuckles].

447
00:24:03,348 --> 00:24:08,778
Bekah: So, when you were doing the
research part of things, was that

448
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:14,028
more ... data sciencey or what
were you doing there?

449
00:24:16,048 --> 00:24:19,348
Bogdan: Yeah. Kind of. Yeah. We
had a lot of ... yeah. There was-

450
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:24,088
there- there was data science part,
and again, diving in with little

451
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:27,269
data science knowledge, cuz I
didn't -- yeah, I didn't study

452
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:32,499
that. I had ideas. I- I knew
Python, for example. But I got --

453
00:24:32,503 --> 00:24:37,999
I- I- I got very -- I got- I gotten -- [chuckles]
get very lucky to- to find this amazing

454
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:40,699
person that really, really took
care of everything, like my

455
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:44,219
mentor, and one of my manager,
bosses, whatever. The person that

456
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:47,578
I actually got a job through. And
she was super amazing. And she

457
00:24:47,578 --> 00:24:49,558
found all these cool
opportunities, and all these

458
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:53,578
relations, and connections, and
papers we wrote, and projects we

459
00:24:53,578 --> 00:24:58,798
got in. So, I had the time to- to
learn it on- on the way, right?

460
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:01,979
Like, I didn't have to worry like,
"Oh, what am I gonna do now?" I'm

461
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:04,858
always just like, I knew what I
have to do, but I also knew what-

462
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,644
what I have to learn. So there
was amazing. But then we also

463
00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:13,064
did APIs, for example, which was
my previous job as well. And I

464
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:18,179
think this is one of the things
that ... kind of help them make the

465
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,209
decision to hire me cuz they
were working already on these

466
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:25,078
APIs. But again, related data,
like, they had -- we had a lot of

467
00:25:25,078 --> 00:25:28,169
data. We needed to serve it to
different sources, to different

468
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:31,739
other universities, for example,
create some user interfaces, and

469
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:37,169
stuff like that. So we created
this APIs ... for them.

470
00:25:37,348 --> 00:25:40,199
Which was more engineering, but
then, yeah. The data science part, we

471
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:43,739
did a lot of machine learning, and
analysis, and NLP for the papers

472
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:49,259
we were- we were writing. It's very
[chuckles] different and definitely

473
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:52,078
some- something that I really
enjoy doing, but I- I knew it --

474
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:56,219
the- the- the whole- the whole way
-- and it was almost three years,

475
00:25:56,219 --> 00:25:59,368
right? I knew the whole time, I
don't wanna do that. I really

476
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:02,338
much enjoyed it. And I really
much loved working with all these

477
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:05,909
people, but I- I knew for sure,
it's- it's not something I'm

478
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:09,929
gonna spend my, you know, my next,
whatever, years doing. So it was like --

479
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:14,743
Bekah: Was there- was there like
a moment that you realized that,

480
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:19,094
or it was just kind of like, "I
can do this, but I'm not super

481
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:19,933
interested in it."?

482
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:24,763
Bogdan: Yeah ... We-well [laughs], I
kind of learned on the job, right? So I

483
00:26:24,763 --> 00:26:28,064
didn't have a moment to actually
reflect, but it was keep on

484
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:33,314
coming, keep on coming. I am
talking about moving rectangles

485
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:35,923
again. This is very serious, so
don't- don't take it too

486
00:26:35,923 --> 00:26:40,753
seriously, but it is. And I -- it's not
that [chuckles]. Seriously. But I ... so,

487
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:47,239
look. I like ... I like things to-
to- to look good. It's- it's very

488
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,058
silly, but I like the tools that
I use to look very good.

489
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:55,818
And Jupyter notebooks are not [laughs]. And of course, you
can load it in VSCode, and things like that. But the whole

490
00:26:55,818 --> 00:26:59,778
concept of like staring the
whole day at those notebooks was

491
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:03,769
something ... it was something
weird for me. I was like, it's not

492
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:06,979
supposed to be like that. I don't
know if you ever worked wi-with data,

493
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:11,548
or with people that are doing data
stuff, but those notebooks are

494
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:15,269
getting extremely messy. I don't
know if it's for everybody or it

495
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:19,588
was- it was just for us, it was
insanely messy. Like there's -- there-

496
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:24,328
there's -- there was impossible to, like,
pick up a notebook I wrote, you know,

497
00:27:24,388 --> 00:27:26,878
three weeks ago, and I still
understand it. Like, it was- it was

498
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,489
insane. So I was like, I don't
know for how long I can, like,

499
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:36,223
guessing my, you know, my- my thoughts
[chuckles], you know? So, of course,

500
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:39,463
I mean, there's -- there are ways
to do it better. It's not like I

501
00:27:39,463 --> 00:27:43,723
tried everything. It was just like
... the comfort of like working,

502
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:47,144
and things like that. I think
more. And also, I didn't know,

503
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:50,578
and I still don't know, and I'm not
at all interested in statistics,

504
00:27:50,578 --> 00:27:54,328
which ... of course we can argue if
that's important or not. But

505
00:27:54,328 --> 00:27:57,598
I felt like I should. Like, we are
talking -- we were always talking

506
00:27:57,604 --> 00:28:03,959
about this models, and probab- probabilities,
and numbers, and constants, and things

507
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:06,838
like that, that I never had an
idea about, which I was

508
00:28:06,844 --> 00:28:09,689
trying to, but like, it seemed
like I'm really, really, really

509
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:13,588
like behind all of this. And I
don't have the- the- the passion

510
00:28:13,588 --> 00:28:14,608
to- to learn it.

511
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:19,638
Bekah: So it's ... oh, it sounds
like you kind of knew what you

512
00:28:19,638 --> 00:28:24,048
wanted to be doing and you did
kind of enjoy that research

513
00:28:24,048 --> 00:28:28,068
aspect of things, but you knew
that was not gonna be like the

514
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:33,903
place that you -- your ideal job
or what you wanted to be doing. So,

515
00:28:34,284 --> 00:28:40,463
how did you make that decision to
move from that research position

516
00:28:40,624 --> 00:28:43,503
and do something that you would
rather be doing?

517
00:28:45,078 --> 00:28:50,148
Bogdan: So I- I never really knew what I
wanted to do af- i-i-in- in the time --

518
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:57,364
the -- wh-what -- all I wanted to- to do --
no. All I knew was, so we- we were- we were

519
00:28:57,364 --> 00:29:02,614
doing a lot of programming by the
end of my employment list. So on

520
00:29:02,614 --> 00:29:06,723
the way ... after the last summer
-- so, basically last summer,

521
00:29:06,753 --> 00:29:10,773
cuz I left in February, right? So,
after the last summer, a lot of

522
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:14,868
other -- not a lot. Like, important
people that I was working close

523
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:22,308
with -- seniors, left. So I was
kind of around, trying stuff. And

524
00:29:22,608 --> 00:29:26,088
having another -- other people, like
on the same level with me, and

525
00:29:26,088 --> 00:29:32,118
things like that, it's really became
... not, you know ... productive.

526
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,759
And I'm not- and I'm not saying it's a
bad thing. I think it's a- it's a- it's

527
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:38,148
a great thing for them to kind of
have the- the, you know, this

528
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:40,818
growing experience, and maybe
growing pains, cuz it was still a

529
00:29:40,818 --> 00:29:44,959
very young lab, right? Kind of
understand th-th-that seniorship

530
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:47,628
matters, and things like that. And
you need mentorship, and you need

531
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:50,598
seniors, and things like that. So
there was a thing. So I was- I

532
00:29:50,598 --> 00:29:53,929
was slacking a little bit behind
because I had a- I had a very weird

533
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:59,959
period after I got COVID.
Even a year after, I was still

534
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:02,358
very sick and things like that.
So they were very, very nice and

535
00:30:02,358 --> 00:30:07,278
kind to allow me to- to- to work
as- as- as much as I can, which

536
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:12,409
was [chuckles] not a lot, right?
So I- I- I did the work that I had

537
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:15,169
to do as- as- as much as I can,
and then when I got a little bit

538
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:19,713
better, I started looking for
jobs. And I wasn't sure what I

539
00:30:19,713 --> 00:30:25,384
want to do. I- I- I was ... I think
in -- by the end of the year, I

540
00:30:25,384 --> 00:30:28,878
think it was November or whatever,
I've been to web summit in

541
00:30:28,878 --> 00:30:33,499
Lisbon. And I've seen all
these companies, and all these

542
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:36,919
hot apps, and all these software
engineers doing a lot of cool

543
00:30:36,923 --> 00:30:39,288
things. And I was like, "I wanna
do cool things, but I didn't know

544
00:30:39,294 --> 00:30:43,278
what a cool thing is [chuckles]." But
I just wanted to, you know, I just

545
00:30:43,284 --> 00:30:45,709
wanted to feel like I'm doing
very cool things, which I was

546
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:47,868
doing at the moment, but in a
different way. Not in an academic

547
00:30:47,868 --> 00:30:52,943
[chuckles] way, right? Yeah. And I
just- I just applied to the startups

548
00:30:52,943 --> 00:30:56,394
that I knew there are in Netherlands,
that kind of met there a bunch to

549
00:30:56,394 --> 00:31:00,828
another companies, and a bunch of agencies.
Cuz I have a f- a friend that is very

550
00:31:00,828 --> 00:31:05,209
much into, like, agencies. He also
has this very tiny agency doing,

551
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:08,439
like branding and marketing for
people, and things like that.

552
00:31:08,778 --> 00:31:13,249
And he was living with me at the
moment. And -- but he was away,

553
00:31:13,308 --> 00:31:16,818
and I started to apply for jobs,
and randomly told him like, "Hey,

554
00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:20,538
dude. I applied for this creative
agencies -- creative agency in

555
00:31:20,538 --> 00:31:24,409
Amsterdam. What do you think about it?"
And then the flood gets so [??] --

556
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:28,969
and he showed me, and told me, and sent
me all I could know about [chuckles]

557
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:32,298
agencies in The Netherlands, which
is very cool. Cuz I wasn't sure

558
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:34,848
if I wanted to do that, but it
sta- finally started to make sense.

559
00:31:34,854 --> 00:31:38,088
Like, I need- I need something
very dynamic, and I need to move

560
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:41,959
around. But I also need a
structure which you sometimes,

561
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:45,739
arguably, don't get in startups
and things like that. So

562
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:50,659
yeah, like, an agency seemed like
a- like a- like a good place.

563
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:54,898
But then I realized, ev- all of
that is project dependent or client

564
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:58,288
dependent, right? Like, you really
need to- to match with- with the

565
00:31:58,288 --> 00:32:02,338
client -- the right clients, and,
yeah, to have the ability to-

566
00:32:02,608 --> 00:32:05,249
to be as flexible as I want to be
and things like that, which of

567
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:11,878
course they could offer. So it's
going ... well [chuckles]. Yeah.

568
00:32:11,939 --> 00:32:13,558
Still not sure what I wanna do.
I'm just around with [laughs]

569
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:15,028
programming.

570
00:32:15,693 --> 00:32:16,324
Bekah: Same.

571
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Bogdan: Yeah [laughs].

572
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:22,557
Dan: Oh man. I- I actually
wanted to swing back to sort of

573
00:32:22,557 --> 00:32:24,987
change topics, but, you were
talking about teaching, I

574
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:28,856
think when you were doing your
master's, right? And you made a

575
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:32,027
joke about teaching -- you're
basically teaching people how to

576
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:40,781
Google. But I- I wa- like, I feel like ...
that's ... that it [clear throat] excuse me.

577
00:32:40,781 --> 00:32:43,182
Maybe that- that's not what you expect
from a professor, but like, that

578
00:32:43,182 --> 00:32:45,701
is like the right way to learn [chuckles]
-- that's what we try to teach

579
00:32:45,701 --> 00:32:52,451
everybody. Not profess- like,
whatever. I don't know what you ...

580
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:56,666
amateur teach? I- I don't
know [laughs].

581
00:32:56,922 --> 00:32:57,761
Bogdan: No, no, no. For sure.
I know what you mean. Yeah.

582
00:32:57,807 --> 00:32:59,636
Dan: Like the ... you know? But when
I'm trying to help somebody learn,

583
00:32:59,636 --> 00:33:01,886
you know, one of the- one of the, like,
learning how to Google things and

584
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:04,707
figure things out for yourself is
like one of the biggest skills to

585
00:33:04,707 --> 00:33:08,037
learn when you're becoming a
developer, right? Especially for

586
00:33:08,037 --> 00:33:12,446
the first time. So I just
wondered if you could tell me a

587
00:33:12,446 --> 00:33:14,906
little bit more about like that
experience of teaching in that

588
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:19,346
structured, you know, in a,
like a structured way as a- as a-

589
00:33:19,346 --> 00:33:22,991
as a ... what- what do you call yourself?
A professor? A- a ... I don't know

590
00:33:22,991 --> 00:33:24,221
what the right term, just --

591
00:33:24,432 --> 00:33:25,211
Bogdan: No. Teaching- teaching-
teaching assistant.

592
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:28,241
Dan: Teaching assistant. Yeah. So as a TA,
like -- but like, what -- can you just

593
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:32,382
describe a little bit more about
that from like -- cuz I've watched

594
00:33:32,382 --> 00:33:36,132
and been on both sides of, you
know, learning from sort of

595
00:33:36,136 --> 00:33:39,432
independent online version,
right? But I don't think

596
00:33:39,432 --> 00:33:42,791
we've had anybody on the podcast
who has, like, taught in that --

597
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:47,201
taught computer science in
this structured way.

598
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:48,386
Bogdan: Yeah, it was -- it-
it- it --

599
00:33:48,432 --> 00:33:50,741
Dan: I know I might be misremembering this, Bekah,
but ... I'm pretty sure [laughs] -- so I'd like

600
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:52,362
to hear about it. Could you
just tell me more about that

601
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:52,781
experience?

602
00:33:53,217 --> 00:33:56,067
Bogdan: No, for sure. But also,
like, they take it with a grain of

603
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,186
salt. Like, I've been a -- I was
a TA. Like, I was still a student,

604
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:00,836
right? So I also being --

605
00:34:01,031 --> 00:34:03,102
Dan: Sure, sure. So you- so you
weren't doing the lesson plans

606
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:03,000
and stuff, but-

607
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Bogdan: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

608
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Dan: -still you were -- I- I just
would like to hear about it. Cuz it's-

609
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Bogdan: Yeah [laughs].

610
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,641
Dan: -it's like the- the process of learning this
stuff is endlessly fascinating to me and ... you know?

611
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:15,612
Bogdan: It is. I think it's very
... yeah, I think it's -- I think

612
00:34:15,612 --> 00:34:18,431
education, especially in computer
science is very fascinating

613
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:23,262
because it's so ... it's so, I don't know.
It's ... yeah. Anyways, [laughs] we'll

614
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:26,802
get in. Yeah, I think that ac-
actually helped a lot. Like, being

615
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:29,862
a TA helped a lot because I
don't think people have too many

616
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:33,911
[chuckles] expectations, I think.
I don't know. They didn't. I had

617
00:34:33,911 --> 00:34:38,757
great students, two times, cuz
there were two periods. And

618
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:45,476
it was- i-i-it was interesting cuz the --
that- that- that's why I think it's very

619
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:50,547
fascinating. Like, we had
different people of different,

620
00:34:50,876 --> 00:34:54,237
like, levels, right? Like it happened
-- they were all in the first

621
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:57,657
year, most probably. Well, I think
it was first year. Yeah. But

622
00:34:57,657 --> 00:35:00,657
some of them had some mathematics
experience, some programming,

623
00:35:00,657 --> 00:35:04,947
some none, and things like that,
but they- they all seemed to- to

624
00:35:05,007 --> 00:35:09,632
kind of like get stuck in the same
kind of places, which I think

625
00:35:09,632 --> 00:35:11,521
it's- it's -- I think it's
interesting. Like, I don't- I

626
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:15,572
don't know much about [chuckles]
education. But I think it's very

627
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:19,561
interesting to kind of see how
they deal in different ways

628
00:35:19,802 --> 00:35:25,411
w-with that. And what I used to do
and I thought it was very funny —

629
00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:28,862
not funny in a mean way [laughs] — it's
just funny to- to just observe

630
00:35:28,862 --> 00:35:32,581
it. It's just like, s-see how they
deal with it. And then like, let

631
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:37,302
them deal with the -- in the way of like
-- I was like, "Oh, yeah. Look, your

632
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:41,021
colleague did it that way. Why don't
you like ... go around this way," and

633
00:35:41,021 --> 00:35:44,202
things like that, which I think
it was a nice- it was a nice,

634
00:35:44,202 --> 00:35:47,831
like, not bonding experience, but
kind of in a way of like level it

635
00:35:47,831 --> 00:35:51,521
down, especially cuz for some of-
some of -- it was in my ear as well.

636
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:56,262
Like, for some of us, it was so, so
like intimidating to know that we

637
00:35:56,262 --> 00:35:59,922
had this people in the class that
were, you know, having

638
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:02,231
experienced in programming and
things like that. I don't know

639
00:36:02,231 --> 00:36:06,081
why. Cuz this is -- it's never a
competition, right? But it was

640
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,811
just weird. It was like, "Oh my god.
They know everything and I don't

641
00:36:08,811 --> 00:36:11,871
know nothing [laughs]," and things like
that. And then, yeah, later it

642
00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:15,771
happened for me to be in that
position and, you know, showing

643
00:36:15,771 --> 00:36:20,092
people -- or students, as a TA, like
to ask those stupid question is

644
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:22,882
very important, and to
Google everything is very

645
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:29,021
important. Cuz I also never
understood ... why it was seen so f-

646
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:32,891
it- it was not seen as like, you
know, frowned upon. It's just

647
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:36,552
like a thing of like the- the
stigma of like, "Oh, I need to

648
00:36:36,552 --> 00:36:41,291
know things." It's just like, you don't
know Java ... words or whatever, you-

649
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:45,942
you know how to- to think [laughs], you
know? So, yeah. I think it was very

650
00:36:46,362 --> 00:36:49,001
cul- cultivating for me as well. And
also Googling in front of people

651
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:50,172
is cool cuz, you know, it's like --

652
00:36:51,146 --> 00:36:52,106
Dan: Yeah, yeah. So --

653
00:36:52,181 --> 00:36:55,782
Bogdan: I, especially -- I'm- I'm good at
Googling. So [all laugh] I think, I- I like to

654
00:36:55,782 --> 00:36:56,952
show off my skills as well.

655
00:36:57,056 --> 00:37:00,536
Dan: Oh, and it is a skill, you know? I
mean, like, way -- a-and i-it's that --

656
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:03,836
it's about like crafting the
right, you know, like, figure

657
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:06,356
out what to Google, you know
what I mean, is- is- is hard. And-

658
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:10,016
and that's like -- that's something
I try to do some- some, you

659
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:13,556
know, when people ask questions
is if it's something that was an

660
00:37:13,717 --> 00:37:18,056
e-e-easy like ... Google search
for me, I will try to share what

661
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:19,000
I searched for [chuckles], you know?

662
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Bogdan: Yeah. Sure, sure. Yeah.

663
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,396
Dan: Like- like not -- don't, like, claim that I knew this
off the top of my head, you know, but like, I also wanna

664
00:37:26,396 --> 00:37:29,666
try to, like -- I don't mean to do
that to be like, "You could have

665
00:37:29,672 --> 00:37:31,000
just Googled this," you know- you
know what I mean? Like-

666
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Bogdan: Sure.

667
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,646
Dan: -cuz that's not like -- there's
that- that -- anytime you're using that

668
00:37:34,646 --> 00:37:38,621
'just' word, like the word 'just',
it's probably a bad, like a- like a --

669
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:42,851
you wanna rethink what you're
thinking because the -- I knew

670
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:45,552
the right terms to search for, to
find that answer, you know what I

671
00:37:45,552 --> 00:37:49,032
mean? But not everybody does.
And, you know, you -- that's

672
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:51,612
something you learn over time.
And it's- it's an important

673
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:53,862
skill. With computer science,
a lot of the answers are out

674
00:37:53,862 --> 00:37:57,000
there ... if you can find them,
you know [chuckles]?

675
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Bogdan: Yeah.

676
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,831
Dan: I've also been trying to do that on-
on our- on our stream sometimes is- is just

677
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:06,192
Google things. The same thing,
you know? Cuz we're- we're just

678
00:38:06,192 --> 00:38:09,072
like learning at -- you know, Kirk
and I are doing that TypeScript

679
00:38:09,072 --> 00:38:12,192
Tuesdays and so, I'm learn- Kirk
is mostly teaching, I'm mostly

680
00:38:12,192 --> 00:38:15,282
learning [chuckles]. But it's like ...
yeah, we just didn't know something. So we

681
00:38:15,282 --> 00:38:19,211
looked it up and there's no -- I don't
feel bad about that [chuckles] at all,

682
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:22,032
you know? And- and nor should I, you
know? I- I think that's a great ...

683
00:38:22,061 --> 00:38:25,331
I dunno. That's a great
attitude to have. I- I would

684
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,302
love to see that as a- as a TA,
you know? Cuz I think it's -- it

685
00:38:28,811 --> 00:38:33,041
can be easy to -- when you are ...
when you're teaching or in that

686
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:37,541
position of like ... I dunno, teaching
something [chuckles]. It could be

687
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:41,711
easy to like, wanna ... know the
answers or wanna like -- I, like -- seem

688
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:44,411
like, you know the answers so
that people trust you more or

689
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:47,382
something like — no, not in like a
nefarious way, but just as a ... as

690
00:38:47,387 --> 00:38:50,891
like a ... I don't know. For me.
This is my personal speaking. It-

691
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:53,922
it's like I- I can fall into that
trap. And I- and I try not -- like,

692
00:38:54,661 --> 00:38:58,496
I- I- I -- it takes effort to,
sometimes for me, to like, not do that,

693
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:00,000
you know [chuckles]?

694
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Bogdan: Yeah. [Unintelligible].

695
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Dan: Because I don't, obviously, know
everything and ... I don't know.

696
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Bekah: I think --

697
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,652
Dan: And it's okay, you know?
It's like --

698
00:39:05,652 --> 00:39:09,012
Bekah: So much of it is based on
our education, right? Because

699
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:12,822
like you're tested, and you're
expected to know information,

700
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:16,452
right? You're not expected to
look up information and find the

701
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:21,552
answers. And so then going on
through years of doing that,

702
00:39:21,552 --> 00:39:26,021
there's -- it- it feels like it's
not successful to have to look

703
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:29,081
something up like, "Oh, you
failed. You should already know

704
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:33,072
this." But it's -- that's not the
case, especially with this now.

705
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:37,572
So, you know, it's always how
to find the answer is more

706
00:39:37,572 --> 00:39:42,222
important. And I read a tweet. I
don't know who tweeted it out,

707
00:39:42,222 --> 00:39:45,161
but it was like, the difference
between a junior developer and a

708
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:49,646
senior developer is they're more
effective. Senior developers are

709
00:39:49,646 --> 00:39:51,000
more effective at Googling. You
just get-

710
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Bogdan: It's true. For sure.

711
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,257
Bekah: -faster, you know more words that you
can use, you can narrow it down more quickly.

712
00:39:58,317 --> 00:40:03,641
And- and I think that that- that's ... a
lot of what it is [chuckles], right? Like

713
00:40:03,911 --> 00:40:08,262
knowing what to look for and what
the approach is because you ha- you

714
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:12,612
have to figure it out. And tech
moves too quickly to memorize

715
00:40:12,672 --> 00:40:18,041
everything that you're doing. So
kn-knowing how to Google and knowing

716
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:23,112
that that's what's expected of you,
I -- is really important. It's a --

717
00:40:23,112 --> 00:40:27,461
you are should not be asking for
the answers every time you hit a

718
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:30,942
roadblock. You should be looking
things up and figuring out how to

719
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:33,851
do them. And that's Nick and I --
Nick Taylor and I did a Lunch

720
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:38,262
and Learn ... last week? Where we kind
of talked about like, what do you

721
00:40:38,262 --> 00:40:40,632
do? How do you navigate those
challenges? How do you ask

722
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:44,052
questions? That kind of thing.
Cuz it's important.

723
00:40:44,097 --> 00:40:48,086
Bogdan: Yeah, it is. I- I- I, yeah.
I think that's great, the- the- the

724
00:40:48,086 --> 00:40:51,086
way you put it. Because I find --
so what I think about is

725
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:55,197
[unintelligible] [chuckles] I find, with
all due respect and love for my parents,

726
00:40:55,197 --> 00:40:58,246
for example, that call me every
time their phone doesn't work,

727
00:40:58,246 --> 00:41:00,987
right? And I'm thinking about
this. Cuz it's like, look, what

728
00:41:00,987 --> 00:41:04,632
I'm doing is just goo- I don't know
your phone by heart, you know?

729
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:08,831
You -- they also have Android phone [laughs].
So, I'm like -- no, I'm not saying it is

730
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:11,862
a weird thing. I just like, I
didn't use an Android for eight

731
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:14,501
years now. I'm like -- I'm not
gonna- I'm not gonna know what you do-

732
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:17,262
what you do have to press. I'm just
gonna Google it and things like

733
00:41:17,262 --> 00:41:22,061
that. But then I kind of took
one step back and realized like

734
00:41:22,152 --> 00:41:25,211
what- what happened with me at
least? And I don't know, I'm not

735
00:41:25,211 --> 00:41:28,931
sure for how many other, like, people
Eastern Europeans [chuckles], is that

736
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:32,952
relatable? Not Eastern
Europeans. Everybody that doesn't

737
00:41:33,431 --> 00:41:36,672
speak natively English, I believe.
Like, we didn't -- I didn't have a

738
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:40,797
computer for a very long time,
right? And when I had it f-for the

739
00:41:40,797 --> 00:41:44,007
first time, I was young -- still
young, but like, I didn't know

740
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:47,606
English. But [chuckles] until once I
started to learn English, I realized how

741
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:50,967
much -- how many things you can
Google, and how many YouTube

742
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:55,047
videos you can watch. It was insane
[laughs]. It was like the- the

743
00:41:55,047 --> 00:41:57,597
whole world open. And finally,
I started to Google everything.

744
00:41:57,717 --> 00:42:00,746
Like ... even for my mom, like, I
was like, "Hey, do you need this?"

745
00:42:00,746 --> 00:42:03,146
And no, no, no. Yeah. And
then, I think that's a thing.

746
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,757
Like, I think that's where they-
they- they draw the line,

747
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:09,222
you know? It's just like ...
navigating the internet to- to

748
00:42:09,222 --> 00:42:13,871
finances and things like that. Which
of course, it learn -- i-it's a skill,

749
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:16,722
right? Like, you have to learn it.
They didn't take the time to

750
00:42:16,722 --> 00:42:20,262
do it, so that's okay. I'm gonna
do it for them [laughs]. But yeah,

751
00:42:20,382 --> 00:42:23,081
like, I think that's- that's-
that's, yeah. That's like, yeah.

752
00:42:23,222 --> 00:42:27,282
How- how you're supposed to- to-
to think about things. Like,

753
00:42:27,282 --> 00:42:30,012
am I supposed to know by phone by
heart? No, of course not. Cuz

754
00:42:30,012 --> 00:42:32,681
it has thousands of menus.

755
00:42:34,106 --> 00:42:36,117
Bekah: Well, it's not necessary, you
know? Like the other thing. We need to --

756
00:42:36,461 --> 00:42:39,311
Bogdan: Exactly. Why would you add --
exactly. Yeah. Why would you adding

757
00:42:39,311 --> 00:42:44,757
all of that if you do it once a year
or whatever [chuckles]? Which happened

758
00:42:44,757 --> 00:42:49,257
to me, by the way, about -- talking
about phone. I'm sorry [laughs]. I was-

759
00:42:49,257 --> 00:42:53,606
I was coming back from a concert
the other week. And it was like a

760
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:59,277
three hours train ride, and my phone
just froze. And it was- it was not

761
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:02,277
dead, but it was just like, the
screen was open, but I couldn't

762
00:43:02,277 --> 00:43:06,686
click anything. And I tried to restarted
it the way I know it [chuckles] and

763
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:09,842
things like that. And it didn't
work. And I s- I didn't have anything

764
00:43:09,842 --> 00:43:12,601
on me. Like, all it was just my
phone and my wallet. So I sit on a

765
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:17,461
train for three hours doing nothing.
Which was a new experience [laughs], you

766
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:21,211
know? I never- I never get to do
that. Also in the middle of the

767
00:43:21,211 --> 00:43:23,911
night. But then I got home,
Google it from my laptop, and

768
00:43:23,911 --> 00:43:27,362
there is a second way to restart
your phone, you know? And that

769
00:43:27,362 --> 00:43:31,291
worked actually. And I was like,
"Wow, should I know this? I don't-

770
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,251
I don't think so [laughs]."

771
00:43:32,396 --> 00:43:33,987
Dan: Why didn't you just look it up on
your phone [Dan and Bekah chuckle]?

772
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:38,891
Bogdan: Yeah, exactly. Why, right?
Yeah [laughs]. Exactly. Yeah.

773
00:43:39,356 --> 00:43:39,806
Dan: Yeah.

774
00:43:40,032 --> 00:43:43,422
Bogdan: Yeah. No, but it was a nice three
hours of ... thinking [unintelligible].

775
00:43:43,422 --> 00:43:44,000
Dan: Wow. So did you like-

776
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Bekah: It was tough.

777
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,751
Dan: -did you like, go into alternate dimensions
or something [all laugh]? You do a zen, you know?

778
00:43:49,751 --> 00:43:53,652
Bogdan: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, it
was weird. I wished- I wished

779
00:43:53,652 --> 00:43:56,501
people would just sit in the
same, like kind of train

780
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:59,141
compartment with me, and speak
English. Cuz everybody was

781
00:43:59,141 --> 00:44:01,961
speaking Dutch around me. And I
was like, "Please someone speak

782
00:44:01,961 --> 00:44:05,262
English. So --" I just- I just wanted
to hear it. I didn't [laughs]- I didn't

783
00:44:05,262 --> 00:44:08,262
wanna talk with them. I just wanted
to hear so I haven't to like think

784
00:44:08,262 --> 00:44:10,000
about ... it's weird. I never
get to do that.

785
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Bekah: Do you speak Dutch?

786
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,722
Bogdan: No [laughs]. No, I don't. So that's why.
But yeah, I don't -- I never get to- to- to

787
00:44:16,726 --> 00:44:20,771
think [chuckles] on my own. I always
have music playing in a background or

788
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:22,152
something. It's very weird.

789
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:27,072
Bekah: Yeah. It's interesting how
much time we occupy our brains

790
00:44:27,311 --> 00:44:32,202
constantly. Like there's a- a need
-- I read this book ... "Bored and

791
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:35,652
Brilliant" maybe? Somebody
recommended it to me. And it was

792
00:44:35,652 --> 00:44:39,311
really good. Like, your brain
needs time to be able to process

793
00:44:39,311 --> 00:44:44,751
different things, to be creative, to,
you know, like store knowledge that

794
00:44:44,757 --> 00:44:50,661
you have accumulated. And I think
that we don't do that. I mean, I --

795
00:44:50,961 --> 00:44:54,922
like, I'm in the car, I have a
podcast on. I'm going for a run, I

796
00:44:54,922 --> 00:44:58,282
have a podcast on. I'm in my
house, I have four kids. Nobody

797
00:44:58,282 --> 00:45:02,572
[chuckles] ever stops. Like, I feel
like I might be afraid of silence at

798
00:45:02,722 --> 00:45:06,771
this point. Like, what- what will
happen if I spend 10 minutes

799
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:08,661
being silent? Let alone three
hours. Like --

800
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:12,536
Bogdan: I- I think I am. But I don't
know. I never re- I never- I never

801
00:45:12,536 --> 00:45:15,416
got the time to actually think
about it. I- I bet I am, right?

802
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:19,016
Like, I can -- I should be able
to go on a walk and not listen to

803
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:23,067
music, right? Like, that's- that's
what I was sup- but I can't, and I

804
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:26,277
think it's weird. Like, I- I
don't know. It's a very weird

805
00:45:26,282 --> 00:45:27,297
thing. And I don't wanna ...
I don't know.

806
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:29,036
Dan: Yeah. I have the same thing.
I have- I have [unintelligible] --

807
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,896
Bekah: So none of us up meditating
then, we're not [chuckles], like --

808
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:31,586
Dan: Oh god.

809
00:45:31,766 --> 00:45:33,806
Bogdan: No way. There's no way it's gonna work.
Tr- [chuckles] yeah. Try [unintelligible] --

810
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:39,567
Dan: I ... yeah. No, I have the -- so
I have the AirPods Pro, and so like

811
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:42,416
to push play, you- you squeeze the
thing that sticks down, you know?

812
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:45,972
And the other day I walked outta
my office and I didn't have them

813
00:45:45,972 --> 00:45:48,101
in, but I thought I had them in, and I
squeezed my ear a little [Dan and Bekah laugh]-

814
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:52,481
a little, and I'm like, "Well,
that was- that was really weird."

815
00:45:53,277 --> 00:45:53,817
Bogdan: Wow.

816
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,751
Dan: I'm just so used to having
them in my ears [laughs].

817
00:45:57,597 --> 00:45:57,597
Bogdan: Wow.

818
00:45:57,597 --> 00:45:58,000
Bekah: Are you --

819
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Bogdan: That's embarrassing [laughs].

820
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,001
Bekah: So now --

821
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,072
Dan: Like, yeah. I need to listen
to my podcast for 30 seconds

822
00:46:03,077 --> 00:46:04,302
while I go get water. Like --

823
00:46:05,382 --> 00:46:06,000
Bogdan: Yeah, exactly [laughs].

824
00:46:05,382 --> 00:46:07,481
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. No, it's
true. Yeah.

825
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:10,646
Bogdan: I do that. Yeah. Or on the toilet.
Like, I- I got to going to the toilet. I

826
00:46:10,646 --> 00:46:14,456
can't just like ... peeing [??].
That's weird.

827
00:46:15,387 --> 00:46:19,737
Bekah: Yeah. Have to be occupied [laughs].
I will say it's- it's nice weather

828
00:46:19,737 --> 00:46:22,646
here. Like very spring weather,
and my kids like to swing on the

829
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:26,456
swings, and I like to swing on the
swings, and that is like maybe the

830
00:46:26,456 --> 00:46:31,577
only time that I can just -- I'm
still, like, moving and ... my brother

831
00:46:31,577 --> 00:46:34,067
was telling me ... I can't
remember. I think it was a

832
00:46:34,067 --> 00:46:38,387
neurologist that- that was saying,
"To improve your memory, you

833
00:46:38,387 --> 00:46:42,106
should try thinking in complete
sentences for like 10 minutes a

834
00:46:42,106 --> 00:46:45,376
day," or something. And so [chuckles]
the other day I was like practicing

835
00:46:45,376 --> 00:46:48,942
that as I was swinging on the
swing next to my kid, like, "There

836
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:52,481
is a tree and the leaves on the tree
are very greenly [chuckles]," I didn't

837
00:46:52,481 --> 00:46:55,541
say it out loud. It was just in my head
[Bogdan laughs], and I'm ike, "This is ridiculous."

838
00:46:55,541 --> 00:47:00,581
I never talk in complete sentences, first
of all. But- but also, it was really

839
00:47:00,581 --> 00:47:05,112
hard. I was like, I was shocked
at how much my mind wondered

840
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:09,132
while I was trying to stay
focused. It was like, "Wait a

841
00:47:09,132 --> 00:47:13,211
minute." I've just like, "Where --
how did I get to this to-do list

842
00:47:13,211 --> 00:47:15,791
that I'm rattling off in my head
because I was just talking to

843
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,592
myself about tree leaves," you
know?

844
00:47:19,226 --> 00:47:22,077
Bogdan: That's -- that -- like, yeah.
Exactly. The w- the way the brain

845
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:26,306
just like, worked, when- when you
don't do -- like, my -- so my- my

846
00:47:26,306 --> 00:47:29,396
therapist told me, like, when I
used to have this anxiety things,

847
00:47:29,396 --> 00:47:33,447
like, whatever moments, like, my-
my super plan, which I 100%

848
00:47:33,447 --> 00:47:36,461
thought it- it's working, cuz it
made me feel better, was just

849
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:40,692
like, if I- if I feel weird, I'll
just like straight up, like put on

850
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:44,351
something ... something that I
can hear and go for a walk, for

851
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:47,081
example and things like that. Which
turns out it's not good [laughs].

852
00:47:47,771 --> 00:47:51,431
Cuz, no. Cuz at the end, she
was like, "Why don't you just

853
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:56,067
like ... sit down, and like, think
about what's happening. Or like,

854
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:59,487
let your- your- your mind
understand like what's happening,

855
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:03,117
and why you feel that way, and things
like that." Which ... I'm gonna

856
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:07,436
give it to her [Bogdan and Bekah laugh], in a ways.
It worked for me. In a- in a very weird way. It's

857
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:11,891
just like -- but then you start to,
like -- I start to like, you know,

858
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:16,362
like, as you said, like realize, oh,
that's -- those leaves there, they're

859
00:48:16,362 --> 00:48:19,121
actually very nice [chuckles], you
know, and things like that. Which-

860
00:48:19,152 --> 00:48:22,572
which never happens when- when ...
yeah. I even, yeah. Like I, even

861
00:48:22,577 --> 00:48:26,442
before sleep, I like to- to- to do
this, and to hear something, and

862
00:48:26,447 --> 00:48:31,461
things like that. I had a- I had
a friend coming into my room. And

863
00:48:31,461 --> 00:48:34,072
I was listening to music, and he
was like, "Do you listen music in

864
00:48:34,072 --> 00:48:40,972
your bed?" I was like, "What [laughs]? Of course I do. Why don't you?"
And it [Dan chuckles] turns out not a lot of people do that [chuckles].

865
00:48:42,802 --> 00:48:45,952
Yeah. It's weird. The brain is
weird.

866
00:48:47,411 --> 00:48:47,802
Bekah: Yeah.

867
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:48,282
Dan: The brain is weird.

868
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:51,791
Bekah: I mean, I even -- like, I have
a fan running when I'm sleeping.

869
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:57,251
Because I can't ... take the silence,
ever. Ugh, sleeping in hotels is

870
00:48:57,257 --> 00:48:59,000
like the- the worst. I hate
sleeping in hotels.

871
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Bogdan: I hate it. Yeah.

872
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Bekah: They're so quiet. Or
they're really noisy. We-

873
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Dan: Yes.

874
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,851
Bekah: -stayed in a hotel this weekend. And there
were people out in the hallway until like, 2:00 AM.

875
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:07,751
Dan: Ugh.

876
00:49:07,867 --> 00:49:08,246
Bogdan: Oh, no.

877
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:11,411
Bekah: That wasn't ideal. Cuz ...
well, I couldn't understand what

878
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:14,141
they were saying because it was a different
language [Bogdan chuckles]. So then it

879
00:49:14,141 --> 00:49:14,411
was like less fine.

880
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,302
Bogdan: I'm staying with Dutch
[Bekah chuckles]. Well, I --

881
00:49:16,302 --> 00:49:19,032
Dan: Were they happy? Were they
happy, or they angry, or --

882
00:49:19,032 --> 00:49:20,322
Bekah: I am --

883
00:49:20,322 --> 00:49:21,000
Dan: Medium?

884
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,896
Bekah: I- I'm not sure. I ...
feel like all of the above. But

885
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:28,436
at one point there was like, this
wasn't -- this was during the

886
00:49:28,436 --> 00:49:33,657
day. There were two young boys,
like wondering down the hallway.

887
00:49:33,657 --> 00:49:36,447
And you can tell their mom was
the one that came outta the room,

888
00:49:36,447 --> 00:49:39,536
because like, she had a total mom
face on. Those kids were not

889
00:49:39,536 --> 00:49:42,177
supposed to be wondering in the
hallway. And she walked with

890
00:49:42,177 --> 00:49:46,737
like, "You are in big trouble [chuckles]."
It was like maybe my favorite part of

891
00:49:46,947 --> 00:49:49,376
the entire hotel stay. Like, I feel you.
I've been there [Bekah and Bogdan chuckle].

892
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:55,000
Dan: U-universal- universal language.
[Unintelligible][laughs].

893
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

894
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:54,431
Bogdan: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[laughs].

895
00:49:54,431 --> 00:50:01,902
Yeah. I used to -- I- I- I
used to live on a moderately

896
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:05,231
crowded city -- street, for Maastricht,
I mean, where there were

897
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:07,211
a bunch of bars, and cafes, and
things like that. And every

898
00:50:07,217 --> 00:50:11,742
single night, people would ...
fight. But it would fight in Dutch,

899
00:50:11,771 --> 00:50:15,702
which was so frustrating. Cuz I
was so curious. Like, no. Like,

900
00:50:15,702 --> 00:50:19,782
seriously. They f- they- they were
fighting so mm- first of all, so

901
00:50:19,782 --> 00:50:23,831
long. Like, you know, you- you- you scream
at each other for a few seconds [chuckles]

902
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:25,931
and it go -- but they were
fighting for so long, and every

903
00:50:25,931 --> 00:50:30,521
single night I was so -- that was my main
motivation to learn Dutch [laughs]. Just

904
00:50:30,521 --> 00:50:33,402
to understand what ... what are
they fighting about? What is --

905
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:33,972
Dan: To understand the drama
[chuckles]?

906
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:35,000
Bogdan: Yeah. Like, exactly.
Like [chuckles] --

907
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Dan: All of that.

908
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,262
Bogdan: Yeah. But then I moved. So I don't
have that excitement in my life anymore.

909
00:50:40,077 --> 00:50:43,137
Bekah: I feel like I would be tempted
to record it. And then trying and get

910
00:50:43,137 --> 00:50:43,827
it translated [laughs].

911
00:50:44,322 --> 00:50:46,931
Bogdan: Translate it after [laughs]?
Never do that. Maybe I should [chuckles].

912
00:50:49,061 --> 00:50:51,161
I tried that with the doctor's
office a bunch of times

913
00:50:51,161 --> 00:50:53,981
when they have the number
pressing things, but it didn't

914
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:54,851
work that well.

915
00:50:55,947 --> 00:50:56,817
Bekah: Ugh. That's frustrating.

916
00:50:57,222 --> 00:50:57,851
Bogdan: Robot voices, maybe. I
dunno [chuckles]. Yeah.

917
00:50:59,943 --> 00:51:04,653
Bekah: Okay. So, you've kind
of like, navigated all over this

918
00:51:04,653 --> 00:51:07,954
career path. I feel like you've
done a lot of different things

919
00:51:07,954 --> 00:51:11,914
and have a lot of knowledge.
And it seems like you're on a

920
00:51:11,914 --> 00:51:18,378
path that you're enjoying now. What
advice do you have for anybody

921
00:51:18,378 --> 00:51:21,469
else that's kind of like
navigating where they wanna go? I

922
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:24,708
especially think like, there's so
many people coming into tech

923
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:30,318
right now. And I think that
there's this focus on ... you have

924
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:35,628
to do this one thing. Like, you
have to do wh-whatever program or

925
00:51:35,628 --> 00:51:38,599
whatever self-taught path you
went on, but there are a lot of

926
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:44,434
different jobs in tech, you know?
So, what advice — like, based on

927
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,224
your journey — would you give to
people who are like doing that

928
00:51:47,224 --> 00:51:49,173
exploration and trying to break
in right now?

929
00:51:50,978 --> 00:51:54,369
Bogdan: So, I mean ... without
adding to the gatekeeping, cuz

930
00:51:54,373 --> 00:51:57,818
you know, everybody -- I feel like,
we all have our ways and things

931
00:51:57,818 --> 00:52:00,909
like that. I'm not gatekeeping
it, but I can- I can talk about

932
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:04,958
like what worked and -- which is
very tricky as well. Cuz I was- I

933
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:08,498
was actually talking a few days
ago with someone -- with a person

934
00:52:08,498 --> 00:52:11,708
that also just started — switch
from physics to computer science

935
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:16,454
and now they got an internship.
And I think it's hard. I --

936
00:52:16,454 --> 00:52:18,974
it's hard for me to be in that
position. And also, I think I ask

937
00:52:18,974 --> 00:52:24,014
a question about this the
other day at Virtual Coffee.

938
00:52:24,043 --> 00:52:28,724
Because I- I still feel like,
everything is so overwhelming

939
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:33,313
already, and it's so hard to find
ways to do things. Like, me

940
00:52:33,313 --> 00:52:38,474
chipping in with [laughs] things would
add to that. But I mean, it's- it's-

941
00:52:38,478 --> 00:52:42,853
it's very interesting. So
like my- my- my advice in

942
00:52:42,858 --> 00:52:47,958
that regard was -- what I was
thinking at the moment ... based on

943
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:52,773
my school experience and my jobs
that I had on the way ... is -- and

944
00:52:52,773 --> 00:52:56,884
I'm not sure exactly [chuckles] how valid
it is -- not valid. It's just like, we-

945
00:52:57,034 --> 00:52:59,373
we already have arguments about
this, right? Like, the way -- the

946
00:52:59,373 --> 00:53:02,373
right way to start to- to learn
programming and things like that.

947
00:53:02,373 --> 00:53:05,284
Oh, should you learn ... React,
although you don't know

948
00:53:05,284 --> 00:53:08,403
JavaScript or whatever. But what
I- what I find very interesting

949
00:53:08,403 --> 00:53:12,213
about my- my experience is that I
spent so much time trying to learn

950
00:53:12,813 --> 00:53:16,143
things -- fundamental things, which
of course are very important. I'm

951
00:53:16,143 --> 00:53:20,914
not gonna argue that, will helps us in-
in- in many, many ways to- to do our

952
00:53:20,918 --> 00:53:25,443
day jobs, but I didn't have time
to- to focus, you know, like

953
00:53:25,443 --> 00:53:30,094
profess- not professionally, but
like academically ... on things that

954
00:53:30,099 --> 00:53:35,284
I'm actually using at my job. So,
look. You do need Java- you do-

955
00:53:35,434 --> 00:53:38,403
you do need to know- to know
JavaScript to- to- to work in

956
00:53:38,403 --> 00:53:40,594
React and things like that. But
if you spend too much time on

957
00:53:40,594 --> 00:53:44,224
that, you'll never -- y-y-you'll-
you'll get a little bit later to these

958
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:48,664
things. And y-y-you might, as I did
it with electrical engineering, I-

959
00:53:48,664 --> 00:53:51,784
I- I missed- I missed the
opportunity to get excited about

960
00:53:51,784 --> 00:53:56,974
it. So I feel like, if we would
spend so much time on learning

961
00:53:56,974 --> 00:54:00,949
the basis of- of JavaScript, and this is not
[chuckles] advocating me -- this is not me

962
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:05,298
advocating for people not to [laughs] learn
the basics. I'm just saying like, the

963
00:54:05,298 --> 00:54:10,018
division of time is very important.
So, I think ... do- doing --

964
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:14,748
mainly doing ... I don't know. For
example, frameworks, and then

965
00:54:15,438 --> 00:54:19,458
picking up as a hobby or as a
second thing, learning the

966
00:54:19,518 --> 00:54:24,094
fundamentals that you don't know ...
would accelerate it a little bit

967
00:54:24,423 --> 00:54:27,094
more. In the way of -- cuz at the
end of the day, as- as, you know, as

968
00:54:27,094 --> 00:54:30,903
developers, as engineers, we have
to- to find solutions and to

969
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:34,954
build things, right? And we're
gonna- we're gonna, eventually,

970
00:54:35,264 --> 00:54:39,784
in wha- in some setups, you- you get paid
[chuckles] to- to use the best tools you

971
00:54:39,784 --> 00:54:44,628
have to build the best things you
can build. And ... how you get

972
00:54:44,634 --> 00:54:47,809
there, like the- the tools you use
to get there, I feel like they're

973
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:51,559
more important than the things
that I spent a lot of time

974
00:54:51,739 --> 00:54:55,909
learning in, you know, all these
formal setups, which was great.

975
00:54:55,909 --> 00:54:59,059
I'm not [chuckles] denying that. But I
just thinking out loud. I think that

976
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:05,358
was the things focusing on tools, and
then learning the- the- the basics

977
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:09,619
and fundamentals as- as we go. Cuz
I think that would help us, you

978
00:55:09,623 --> 00:55:14,583
know, get a little bit more creative
[chuckles]. I think. I dunno. I

979
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:18,273
dunno if it makes sense [laughs].
But that's what I was thinking about

980
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:18,724
the other day.

981
00:55:19,548 --> 00:55:22,188
Bekah: No, I think that makes
total sense. And I think that's a

982
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:25,518
great way to end the episode. So,
I wanna thank you, Bogdan, for

983
00:55:25,523 --> 00:55:28,639
being here with us today. We
really enjoyed having this

984
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:29,418
conversation with you.

985
00:55:30,454 --> 00:55:31,000
Bogdan: Thank you. Very --
thank you very much-

986
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Dan: Thanks, Bogdan.

987
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,603
Bogdan: -for having me. And it's very --
yeah. Very nice to- to be here. Thank you.
