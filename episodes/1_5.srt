00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,980
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 1, Episode

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,339
5 of the Virtual Coffee Podcast.
I'm Bekah, and this is

3
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,519
a podcast that features members
of the Virtual Coffee community.

4
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,670
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,484
stages of their coding journey.
And they're here, on this

6
00:00:31,484 --> 00:00:33,298
podcast,

7
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,329
sharing their stories and what
they've learned. And we're here

8
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,689
to share it with you. Here with
me today is my co-host, Dan.

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,979
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. Today,
on this episode, you'll hear

10
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,369
from Rahat Chowdhury and Cameron
Bardell. Rahat is a

11
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:50,640
second-career developer, mental
health advocate, live coding

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,700
streamer, and a rapper. He is
also the founder of a mental

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,939
health startup called Whimser,
which is aimed at providing

14
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:01,140
tools to help keep up your
mental health. Cameron is an iOS

15
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,379
developer in the healthcare
industry from Waterloo, Ontario.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,439
He is also in the final stages
of an undergraduate degree in

17
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,340
physics and computer science. In
this episode, we talk about

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,069
building mental health projects
balancing mental health with

19
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:17,609
careers and life and how mental
health recovery isn't linear.

20
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:20,099
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast

21
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:22,859
like we start every Virtual
Coffee. We introduce ourselves

22
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:27,000
with our name, where we're from,
what we do, and a random check

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,349
in question. Today's question
is, if you had to choose one

24
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:34,109
song for karaoke, what would it
be?

25
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,040
Hey, I'm Bekah. I'm a front-end
developer from a small town in

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,785
Ohio. And if I could sing one
song for karaoke, it would be

27
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:54,090
"No Time Left For You" by The
Guess Who?

28
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,340
Dan: Nice. Hi, I'm Dan. I'm a
front-end developer from

29
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:06,000
Cleveland, Ohio. I would-- if I
could sing any karaoke song, I

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,639
think anything about Cake is,
like, really in my wheelhouse.

31
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,129
Both, you know, I like the music
and his register kind of matches

32
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:17,159
mine. So I think, pretty much
anything by Cake. And I would

33
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,270
just see what they have and pick
one.

34
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,810
Rahat Chowdhury: Hey, I'm Rahat,
a software engineer from New

35
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,650
York. If I had to pick one song
for karaoke, I guess it would be

36
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:30,719
"I Don't Want To Miss A Thing".
Because I am a new dad, and I've

37
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,789
been obsessed with my daughter
for the past month. So yeah.

38
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,710
Dan: That's a good one.

39
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,999
Cameron: That's better than what
I got [laughs]. I'm Cameron.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,379
I'm an iOS developer from
Waterloo, Ontario. And my go-to

41
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,750
karaoke song is "Smile" by Uncle
Cracker.

42
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,400
Dan: Nice.

43
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,520
Bekah: Awesome. Well, thank you
both for being

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,550
here. We're very excited to have
you on today to talk about

45
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,879
mental health tech. Both have
been working on some really cool

46
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,169
projects that we're excited to
talk about. But before we get

47
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:04,500
there, I always like to do a
little bit of the origin story.

48
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,674
And so, can you talk about
that-- maybe, Cameron, if you

49
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:08,818
want to

50
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,449
talk first and tell us how you
got into tech, and then Rahat.

51
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:13,289
That would be awesome.

52
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,449
Cameron Bardell: Sure, yeah. I
was always, like, it's kind of

53
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,199
a techie kid. And then-- but I
didn't do any real programming

54
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,979
until I got to high school. So I
think, it was in about grade 10

55
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,810
when I took my first, you know,
intro to programming course,

56
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,310
which was

57
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,039
all in Python. And my- my
teacher that course—who was a

58
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,229
really good guy, who I still
talk to sometimes—he was my

59
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:37,689
computer science and physics
teacher in high school. And now,

60
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:40,300
I do computer science and
physics. So you can see where

61
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,879
that came from. He just noticed
that I was taking a bit of extra

62
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,484
interest, then he pulled me
aside and said, "Would you like

63
00:03:44,484 --> 00:03:46,089
to find

64
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,120
some extra projects to work on?"
And I said, "Yeah." So, he sent

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,530
me down to the, like, center for
extended learning—I think it

66
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,535
was called there, in high
school. And they were started--

67
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:55,540
got

68
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,550
started with a

69
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,395
project building Flash games and
Action- and ActionScript

70
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:01,240
[laughs].

71
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,319
Educational-- yeah, RAP Flash,
educational games and

72
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,374
ActionScript for students, and
that was my first-- I don't

73
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:09,429
know, the first thing I

74
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,789
ever programmed that anyone else
ever looked at. And, you know,

75
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:14,289
I just took it from there.

76
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,269
Bekah: That's awesome. I always
love those

77
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,240
stories when you have good
teachers who kind of, you know,

78
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,930
notice that in you and- and
they're able to cultivate that.

79
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,540
Cameron: That's a big thing what
he does at that school with me.

80
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,628
He always, like, kinda gets
identifies the kids who

81
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,540
are, you know, do a little extra
just because they're interested

82
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,519
in any tries to take them under
his wing. Just super great.

83
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,730
Bekah: So great. All right.
Rahat.

84
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,629
Rahat: Yeah. So, I got into tech
a little bit later in

85
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:44,379
life, I guess. So, I had a built
up a career kind of in, like,

86
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:47,319
customer support. And I was
managing customer support teams

87
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,734
at different tech startups. And
I got to, like, work with a lot

88
00:04:49,734 --> 00:04:52,149
of

89
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:55,120
the engineers just seeing, like,
different bugs kind of get fixed

90
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,189
whenever a customer would like
complain about things, I guess.

91
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,779
And that's what kind of got me
interested into the whole thing

92
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:05,290
at first. I wanted to see if I
could be the one actually fixing

93
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,329
stuff. So, my wife is really
supportive. She helped me

94
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:14,620
through a lot of things and went
to a bootcamp. And, yeah, now

95
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,579
I'm doing fixing stuff.

96
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:21,819
Bekah: That is awesome. I love
it. And so you

97
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:24,459
both also have different
histories with Virtual Coffee.

98
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:28,930
Cameron, I feel like I've known
you forever. I remember you

99
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,470
first joining Virtual Coffee.
But I always like to ask to

100
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,050
you, how did you find Virtual
Coffee?

101
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,110
Cameron: Yeah. So, someone
retweeted, I think. It

102
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,110
was in June, you guys there in
April, right? Then, somebody

103
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,500
retweeted your invite link in
June. And I think, I just

104
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,540
replied to the tweet asking you
if it was public or if it was,

105
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,430
like, kind of close thing? You
said, "Yeah, it's public. Come

106
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,550
join." So, I did. And I've been
coming ever since then. It was

107
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,740
probably-- it was really, you
know, in the midst of the

108
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,620
pandemic. And, you know, talk to
anyone that it wasn't directly

109
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,550
related to a month, it was a bit
of a savior for me.

110
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,529
Definitely one of the best
things I did in all of 2020.

111
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,800
Bekah: Yeah. And now, you are--
you're growing

112
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:06,779
our iOS, our mobile group of
developers because people see,

113
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,729
and they come for Cameron.

114
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,240
Cameron: Yeah. I was the only
one for a long time [laughs].

115
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,290
I was only one for a few months.
Now, I think,

116
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,589
we're up to four or five. You
know, we're still ... what is

117
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:18,810
that? 2% of all the people who
attend [laughs], but still.

118
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:22,019
Dan: Also a strong member of our
Canadian contingent.

119
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,160
Cameron: Right? Yeah.

120
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,480
Bekah: Yeah.

121
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,699
Cameron: Like, I'm meeting some
niche groups.

122
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:32,279
Bekah: [Laughs] And Rahat, how
did you find Virtual Coffee?

123
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,514
Rahat: I think I've seen it a
couple times on

124
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:36,209
Twitter.

125
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:38,219
And I didn't join at first
because I'm not 100% know what

126
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:47,579
it was? And then, I think it was
Andy, from protege.dev, told

127
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:52,350
me a little bit about it. And
yeah, joined in into one of the

128
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,089
meetups, I guess. And then,
yeah, from there just really

129
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:00,269
loved the environment and vibe.
So, kept going.

130
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,579
Bekah: Yeah, nice. I remember- I
remember that

131
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:05,129
conversation now. Because we
were talking about working on

132
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,180
Epic React.

133
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:06,569
Rahat: Yeah.

134
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,439
Bekah: And we have a channel for
that, which is not

135
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:10,980
that active [laughs].

136
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,309
Rahat: [Laughs] Came for Epic
React, stayed for

137
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,328
everything else.

138
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,180
Bekah: There you go. It's our
new tagline.

139
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,639
Okay, so both of you have
projects using mental health

140
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,970
tech, and I'd love to talk a
little bit more about those. So,

141
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,540
can you just kind of give an
overview about the projects that

142
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,529
you started?

143
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,479
Rahat: Yeah. So, there's a
couple-- two things that I'm

144
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:40,649
mainly working on. One is an
open source project. It's called

145
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:47,040
The Sylar Project. So, that is
sort of, like, a database of

146
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,600
different mental health
resources in the US. What I'm

147
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,110
hoping is to kind of like, get
people to help me add more and

148
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,370
more resources to it. And either
in their own states or cities.

149
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,800
So, there could be, like, more
stuff for people to look up. The

150
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,160
reason I kind of started it is
because, you know, taking that

151
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,240
step into, like, trying to find
help or find resources that will

152
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,620
help you is like a pretty big
one. And I wanted to make it as

153
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,310
easy as possible, like, once you
did make that step to find

154
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,790
something that could be helpful
for you. So, having it all kind

155
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,060
of like in one central place
would be, you know, probably

156
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,250
ideal for that. So yeah, I'm--
eventually I'm going to turn it

157
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,779
into, like, an API that other
developers can, like, build

158
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,308
stuff

159
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:40,559
off of. But for now, yeah, it's
just kind of a list. The US,

160
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,240
hopefully, maybe in more
countries soon. And yeah, the

161
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:49,500
thing is a startup, I'm hoping
to launch very, very soon. It's

162
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,100
called Whimser. And it's all
about cognitive-behavioral

163
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,940
therapy, and kind of like
journaling and voice note

164
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,870
journaling, and kind of getting
reminders of, like, the good

165
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:03,929
things that happened over time
and challenging those negative

166
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:04,320
thoughts and stuffs.

167
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:08,340
Bekah: That's awesome. I love
that. I was

168
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,440
working on this postpartum app.
And I kind of just went into it,

169
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,220
working on it by myself. But I
reached out to a group of moms

170
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,679
and I said, like, "What would
you like to see in something

171
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,370
like this?" And one of the top
responses was resources for my

172
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:29,039
area. And I didn't have anything
about that there. But also, it

173
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:34,139
was really hard to find that
online, too. And so, I certainly

174
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:38,700
think that that's really, really
valuable. Along with, you know,

175
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,669
all of the other things,
anything that can benefit mental

176
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:43,740
health is super important.

177
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,529
Rahat: Yeah, I think there's
like a lot of, I guess,

178
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:49,139
niches in mental health that
aren't really covered in some of

179
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:52,139
the general labs. So, there's
definitely a lot of things that

180
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:54,450
we can do in this space.

181
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,730
Bekah: I feel like I could talk
about it for seven

182
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:03,059
hours. So, try and stay focused
here. Cameron, what about

183
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:03,840
your project?

184
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,629
Cameron: Sure. So, my project
kind of grew out of my

185
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:09,450
own personal journey with mental
health. I was doing lots of

186
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,570
research on how people track
their mental health over time

187
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,929
and how you can do-- there's
various different methods to,

188
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:19,169
like, check trends and mental
health. Whether it's like- like

189
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:20,639
CBT—like Rahat said—or just,
like, doing daily journaling

190
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,109
or--

191
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:26,580
and I found that a lot of these
clinical studies use these super

192
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,500
long surveys that can take up
to, like, half an hour to

193
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,960
complete, and you're supposed to
do them every day. And that's

194
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,690
exhausting. And it was a time
for that. So I dug a little more

195
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,480
into that and found that those
studies who use those-- I would

196
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,039
certainly have their place and
not saying they should be

197
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,909
replaced in anyway. But they can
often get similar results to

198
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,970
these other smaller scale
studies that use really simple

199
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,274
measurement systems. And the one
I found that I really liked

200
00:10:46,274 --> 00:10:47,548
was--

201
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:52,320
so, it's just really simple. All
you do is you get yourself your

202
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,110
mental well-being—whatever is
most important to you—on a

203
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,690
scale of 1 to 10, once in the
morning and once in the

204
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,570
evening, and you do that twice.
So, you do it kind of for your

205
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,604
general overall well-being.
Then, you pick another thing

206
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:02,638
that's

207
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,889
important to you, whether
that's, you know, your sleep or

208
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:08,490
your anxiety or your nutrition,
and you rate that in a scale of

209
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,440
1 to 10 along with your general
wellness. So, you're

210
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,419
basically doing four readings a
day. Two in the morning, two in

211
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:14,234
the afternoon. It's super easy
to do. You-- I-- you know, you

212
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:16,049
open

213
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:18,269
after 10 seconds a day and do
your reading, and then you go

214
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:20,700
about with your day. So I
started building an app for

215
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,299
that. And I've had to kind of
shell that a little bit because

216
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,179
I recently started a new full
time job, hoping to get back to

217
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:29,639
it soon. But, yeah, I think a
lot of the solutions out there

218
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,729
really intensive and
time-consuming. And you're meant

219
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:34,439
to

220
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,350
open the app and kind of spend
some time in there. But I think,

221
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,320
you know, the goal for my app
would be to spend as little time

222
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:40,980
in it as possible.

223
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:45,000
Bekah: Yeah, I like that
approach. Some of

224
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,685
those, you- you look at in it,
it's so complicated. It-- that

225
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:50,370
it-- it's an

226
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,330
automatic, like, I'm done. I'm
not gonna sit here and go

227
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,509
through all of these things. And
watch all of your screens give

228
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,309
me messages and positive things
like I want to feel where I

229
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:01,109
wanna go.

230
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,299
Cameron: It feels like you're
supposed to live in the

231
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:05,730
app, sometimes. Like, they have
common videos to watch and, you

232
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,124
know, like, maybe guided
meditations, or some of them

233
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:08,518
are,

234
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,220
like, gamified, where you can,
like, earn awards and stuff. And

235
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,710
sure, yeah, those work for tons
of people get great reviews and

236
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,359
works a lot. But it doesn't work
for me [laughs]. I want to, you

237
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,008
know, I

238
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:20,009
want to spend as little time
thinking about it. So-- and

239
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,299
there was no solution out there.
So, I built it.

240
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:26,039
Dan: That's awesome. I was going
to say something about

241
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,699
the--

242
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,639
oh, the cognitive therapy. Yeah.
Rahat, you had mentioned that

243
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,624
with your- with your startup
that you're working on, the--

244
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:38,609
that area

245
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,509
of, like, therapy has been very
interesting to me. And at some

246
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:44,474
times, it's been successful but
a lot of it with-- I mean,

247
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:46,439
personally,

248
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,150
when-- I mean, it's just my
personal experience, my problem

249
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,860
with it

250
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,509
is sort of getting myself to do
anything about it. And this is

251
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:57,029
sort of applies to what Cameron
was saying to you. But, like,

252
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,470
the exercises that a therapist
would- would give me would be,

253
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,820
you

254
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,519
know, these things that I have
to both remember how to do-

255
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,509
remember to do them, and then
also, I don't know, do them at

256
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:07,604
the right way or whatever. Or
maybe, there isn't, like, a

257
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:08,699
right

258
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,149
way. But it's like there's full
of doubt, you know, like,

259
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,600
wondering if I'm doing it the
right way or not. So, I was- I

260
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,105
was wondering if there's-- if
you have some plans with

261
00:13:18,105 --> 00:13:20,610
cognitive

262
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,750
therapy, like, specifically
about, you know-- I don't know.

263
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,389
About how to approach, like,
sort of things like that?

264
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,149
Rahat: Yeah. I think, in our
case, probably-- cognitive

265
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:33,299
behavioral therapy is probably
just kind of in the MVP or the

266
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:35,864
beginning stages. What we're
kind of planning to do is, like,

267
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:38,429
have it

268
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,690
be a little bit of a guided sort
of prompt thing, but hopefully,

269
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,929
with not too many prompts—like
Cameron mentioned—which is

270
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:49,289
definitely an issue in a lot of
apps. So, it's kind of like

271
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,929
choose your emotion. You can
write down something, record

272
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:56,984
something, and be done with
that. Or if you want to, like,

273
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:59,039
get

274
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,740
more insight onto things and
challenge some of your thoughts.

275
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,769
It'll then take you on, like,
guided, like, two more questions

276
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,829
of, like, "what's a cognitive",
like, "a cognitive behavioral

277
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:10,859
distortion

278
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,360
that you're facing right now",
gives you some info about what

279
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,080
those are, and asks you to kind
of challenge the thought in some

280
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,915
way. And, you know, if-- and
that- that journey, I think, is

281
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:24,750
more

282
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:30,059
optional. And sort of like, if
you just want to record- record

283
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:33,240
yourself an event, it's kind of
like-- that's an option too.

284
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,900
And if you do want more- more of
that info and more, like, I

285
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,840
guess

286
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:44,100
more deeper CBT stuff, then it's
a little bit guided scope and

287
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,200
more questions on that. Our
eventual hope is that the app

288
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:55,379
kind of becomes a sort of like a
custom journey based on, like,

289
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,450
your work with, like, your
therapist or psychiatrist or

290
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,369
whoever. We're hoping that,
like, health professionals can,

291
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:01,288
like,

292
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:03,584
prescribe a journey for the app
that's tailored towards the

293
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:05,789
user.

294
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,570
Dan: That's really interesting.
Yeah, that-- I hadn't

295
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,030
really thought about-- I mean,
they don't always-- like,

296
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,490
there's

297
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,440
a lot of apps out there. But not
always connected, you know, to,

298
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,955
like, to therapy, right? And
it's kind of, "Okay, therapy is

299
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:22,320
either

300
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,559
not doing it for me," or, you
know, something like that. And

301
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:28,889
people are kind of going on
their own-- to, like, onto the

302
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:29,700
app store, you know?

303
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,909
Rahat: I think CBT definitely
doesn't work for

304
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:37,190
everybody. So, yeah, our goal is
just to, like, while we're

305
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,509
starting there, we just want to
figure out, like, something easy

306
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:45,559
and simple for people to do that
is helpful for them. And just

307
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:48,980
based on stuff that an actual
therapist would recommend for

308
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,690
them to do on their own time.

309
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:51,919
Cameron: Like Rahat said
earlier, there's tons of room in

310
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,524
the space, very-- like, very
individual responses. I mean,

311
00:15:53,524 --> 00:15:55,129
that's the

312
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:56,629
whole problem with mental
health. It's the problem and

313
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:58,159
the solution, I guess, is that
it's so varied for an

314
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,689
individual,

315
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,600
for everyone. So yeah, there's
just tons of different ways to

316
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,174
build tools like this. And
each-- I know, part of figuring

317
00:16:04,174 --> 00:16:05,719
out how

318
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,220
to control your own mental
health is you might have to try

319
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,870
a lot of these different things,
and most of them won't work. And

320
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,235
that's really hard and
frustrating. But, you know, it's

321
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,929
part of the journey.

322
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,409
Bekah: Yeah. And I think, you
know, they're all

323
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,799
valuable. Because everybody
approaches it a different way.

324
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:23,309
And I think that technology is
really changing the face of how

325
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:27,330
we view mental health. I mean,
even openness to talking about

326
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,990
it and having these
conversations. I know, like, in

327
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,889
my mental health journey, it
would not be nearly as

328
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:38,850
productive as it was if I didn't
talk to other people who

329
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,049
I never would have met on, if I
weren't on Twitter or online

330
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:46,830
or whatever, you know? So,
hearing other people's stories

331
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,210
kind of guided my journey and
where I was going, but it looks

332
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:57,360
different for every person. And
the more we learn about it, I

333
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,049
think using technology also
helps us better identify the

334
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:04,140
problems and the solutions that
will work for different people.

335
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:06,868
Cameron: And the good thing
about using technology for

336
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:08,969
that kind of things, it's
impartial. Like, a big part of

337
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:10,364
the reason why I built what I
built is that, like, uncompress

338
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,759
new

339
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,489
things, and graphs, and numbers.
And so, I wanted to see, like,

340
00:17:15,538 --> 00:17:18,509
kind of the true history of- of
what I was feeling. And so I

341
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:20,638
looked, and when I was doing
this research, I found out that

342
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,179
there's a lot of studies that
show that if you ask people how

343
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,788
they're feeling at a certain
time and on a scale of 1 to

344
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:29,818
10 like I said, like, say, they
get a text and they have to say

345
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:32,308
"How do I feel right now?" And-
and you do that multiple times,

346
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:33,448
maybe throughout a day or
throughout the week, and then

347
00:17:33,448 --> 00:17:34,588
you ask them

348
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,528
later on, looking back, how did
you feel on average in total?

349
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:40,078
Those two numbers almost never
lined up. How people say they

350
00:17:40,078 --> 00:17:41,758
feel at the moment is not how
they say they felt later

351
00:17:41,758 --> 00:17:43,438
[laughs]. So,

352
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:45,868
that was one of- of another one
reasons why I made this thing

353
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:48,388
that you have to do. Well, you
don't have to-- you can do it

354
00:17:48,388 --> 00:17:50,548
as many times as you want. But,
you know, ideally twice a day,

355
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:54,179
and you do it right in the
moment really quickly. It's just

356
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,189
really important to have that
kind of self-knowledge, and be

357
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:57,464
able to look back, and see
things trending up or down in

358
00:17:57,464 --> 00:17:58,739
different

359
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:01,439
directions. Like, my app doesn't
offer any kind of therapy or any

360
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:04,648
information other than what you
give it. It's just- it's just a

361
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:05,338
personal record.

362
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:08,578
Dan: Yeah. That's really cool.

363
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,049
Bekah: Yeah, I-- Cameron, I
wanted to talk about

364
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:15,599
something that you said in Slack
the other day, too. I

365
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,920
think it was somewhere near you
is trying to help people feel

366
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,509
connected during the time of the
pandemic. And I'm always, you

367
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:28,170
know, found that community is
the most important part of

368
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,430
growing through mental health
challenges. Can you just talk a

369
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:36,660
little bit about what they were
doing there? Because I found it,

370
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,369
like, this really kind of simple
but beautiful way of

371
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:42,450
connecting people.

372
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,609
Cameron: Yeah, that was a really
interesting project.

373
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:48,420
So, it's called-- I go to
University of Waterloo, which

374
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,529
is, like, common engineering and
science-based school in Ontario.

375
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,680
And so, I just saw on Twitter
that a couple of engineering

376
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,420
students put together this
project, and it's basically a

377
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,049
heat map of the university
campus and where people report

378
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:04,170
they've cried on campus, which
sounds kind of funny. I think

379
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,359
it's really interesting because
their- their stated goal is just

380
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:09,839
to show people, like, when you
get, you know, into kind of

381
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:11,789
worked up emotional state like
that, I think it's really normal

382
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,680
to kind of want to hide
yourself, you know? You want to

383
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,470
make-- you want to go, be alone
somewhere, and you kind of

384
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,049
experienced that on your own.
But, yeah, they just put

385
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:22,829
together this map just to show
that, you know, if you've done

386
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,559
it, if you're struggling with
it, then someone else's too. And

387
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,750
they've got-- it's a heat map,
like I said. And then, there's

388
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,359
also just kind of some people
did more personalized stories.

389
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,430
So, I thought, that was a really
interesting project, especially

390
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,410
during a pandemic and we're all
more isolated than ever.

391
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,459
Bekah: Yeah, that idea of- of
connecting people

392
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:44,250
is- is really important. I think
that, you know, you do sometimes

393
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,019
get in that moment where you
think, like, "Well, I'm the only

394
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,459
one that feels this way." But
just, like, having a simple

395
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:48,899
visual

396
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,710
of, like, "Oh, I cried. But look
at somebody right over there did

397
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,160
too."

398
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,200
Cameron: I'm looking at the map
right now, and I'm like,

399
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,660
"Oh, look at the engineering
building. I've had long nights

400
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,980
there too." [Laughs]

401
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,990
Bekah: Yeah, I think that's
really, really

402
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,610
great. Okay. So, I would love--
you talked a little bit about,

403
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,230
you

404
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,099
know, how you kind of got into
pursuing these. So, it sounds

405
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:14,519
like, for both of you, there's
some type of personal component

406
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,509
to this. And I'd love to know--
or if you are up for talking a

407
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:22,170
little bit more about, like, the
inspiration behind this. And if

408
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,009
you learned anything new about
yourself or, you know, what you

409
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:30,059
were doing through- through this
journey, that would be awesome.

410
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,390
Rahat: Yeah. I think, for me--
so, the idea for this

411
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,399
kind came out of, like, some of
my own personal experiences.

412
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:40,348
Going to

413
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:44,519
therapy, trying to take care of
my own mental health and all

414
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:48,689
that. And, like, the one of the
main things was, like, therapy

415
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:52,859
is

416
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,480
helpful. But it's only 45
minutes, once or twice a month,

417
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,349
or every other week, or
something like that. And there's

418
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:05,430
all this other time in between
where just, like, I-- I'm not

419
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:10,259
sure sometimes, like, I guess,
how to take care of myself for,

420
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:15,990
you know, try to, I guess, make
my mental health better in some

421
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,980
way. So that was like a large
part of the conversation that I

422
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,980
was having with my therapist.
And she would give me, like,

423
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,305
different prompts and stuff.
And, like, sort of like CBT

424
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:27,630
based

425
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:32,549
things to try out on my own is
writing stuff out. And it was

426
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:37,049
pretty helpful. And the thing
that I realized was really

427
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:40,380
helpful for me was, like, when
I-- in those moments, when I was

428
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,400
able to remember back to, like,
a positive thing—kind of related

429
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,279
to whatever I was doing. Like,
if- like, if I was having a

430
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,420
crap day at work. But then,
thinking about another time

431
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,180
where, you know, something went
right at work, that was

432
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,029
sometimes pretty helpful. So,
that was kind of like a lot of

433
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:03,839
the basis for the app itself of,
like, having some positive

434
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,700
reinforcement in those negative
times.

435
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,519
Dan: Yeah, that's really cool. I
have-- I also have trouble

436
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,639
with it. The connection between,
like, different appointments

437
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:13,048
and-

438
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:15,420
and just sort of everything, it
seems to make sense, you know,

439
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,529
when you walk out of an
appointment, and then a week

440
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:21,209
later, you're like, "I don't--
[laughs] I don't know. I don't

441
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:22,889
know what

442
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,945
I'm doing. I don't know," you
know? Like, all the-- all that

443
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:27,000
stuff. I

444
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,660
guess a place where, like,
technology can, you know, like,

445
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,480
really shine, I think, if, you
know, if applied correctly.

446
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,299
Bekah: Cameron, I don't know if
you want to

447
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:37,710
share. You don't have to, but--

448
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,089
Cameron: Yeah, no, totally.
Yeah, part of my, like,

449
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,369
journey with my personal mental
health, I guess, I started

450
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:46,059
struggling with anxiety in my
pre early teens and kind of

451
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:51,039
kept them to myself for a long
time. So, like, I feel like most

452
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,400
of the last several years for me
has been a process of opening

453
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,859
it up to slowly, like, wider and
wider circle of people. So, it

454
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:59,140
started eventually, like, you
know, talking to my parents, and

455
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,640
then they helped me a lot. And
then, you know, from there, I

456
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,140
was

457
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,759
like, "Okay, that worked out
pretty well." And then I, you

458
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,650
know, started talking to a
doctor, and then I do even more.

459
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,839
I said, "Wow. This seems to be a
trend [laughs] if there's

460
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,669
anything." So then, you know,
you

461
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,960
start opening up to a wider
circle of people. So, my

462
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,250
friends,

463
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,250
you know, you guys, eventually.
And now here I am, on a podcast,

464
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,680
talking about it. That's been a
really important part of the

465
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,650
process for me. We have a Slack
channel in- in Virtual Coffee,

466
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,740
where we talk about these sorts
of things. And, you know, people

467
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,079
have been, you know, pretty
open. And, you know, not

468
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:26,979
everyone has to be open and just
something that happens to

469
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:27,879
help

470
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,410
me personally. I would never say
that, like-- I don't even know

471
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,440
how to phrase this. Like, I
would never tell anyone that

472
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,569
they should go and talk about
their experiences because it

473
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:39,099
will definitely help, you know,
it might not [laughs]. Depends.

474
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:40,629
It just

475
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,024
happened to help out for me. And
I only came to that realization

476
00:23:42,024 --> 00:23:46,839
after, like, several years of
struggling. So yeah. That's-

477
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,779
that's kind of been an ongoing
thing for me.

478
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,369
Dan: Yeah, that's actually been
a trend we've noticed with

479
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,559
Virtual Coffee. And not just
with mental health, although

480
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,849
definitely with mental health.
And even just being-- becoming a

481
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:04,619
developer or learning, finding--
you know, finding a job, all of

482
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:06,629
these things that-- over and
over again, we have people that

483
00:24:06,629 --> 00:24:08,639
come

484
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,519
in or just feel alone, you know?
Feel like they're the only

485
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,650
ones are feeling something's
wrong with them that because

486
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,400
they are struggling finding a
job or struggling learning, you

487
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,490
know? Anything. Learning
anything in tech and is or

488
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,080
struggling with, you know,
mental health things and finding

489
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,670
other

490
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,410
people that are also, you know,
going through a lot of the same

491
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,150
things.

492
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,490
Cameron: And I would encourage
you to say like, "You

493
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:31,289
don't even have to say anything

494
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:33,569
when you're in these spaces."
Like, "You can just go and be a

495
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:35,549
lurker until you feel
comfortable." I mean, you'll

496
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:37,500
never feel comfortable sharing
yourself that you can go and see

497
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:39,794
what other people are saying,
you know? Maybe that's something

498
00:24:39,794 --> 00:24:44,039
that

499
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:42,149
could help. Like, that includes,
like, you know, mental health

500
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:46,289
stuff in

501
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:48,630
the job search. And I know
Bekah's been and several other

502
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:50,549
people in the Slack've been
leading the way on, like, a

503
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:53,039
neuro-diversity channel, which
is really great to see. So all

504
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:54,750
those kinds of things. You can-
you can reach out and find these

505
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,420
spaces, and you don't have to be
sure if it's right for you to

506
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,315
share. You can definitely kind
of hang out for a while, and

507
00:24:57,315 --> 00:24:59,880
it's

508
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,805
take your bearings. And maybe
decided that it's not for you,

509
00:24:59,805 --> 00:25:02,190
and

510
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,569
that's okay, too. But, yeah, you
don't have to feel pressured to

511
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,569
say anything.

512
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,349
Rahat: Yeah. I think, a pretty
good other benefit that

513
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:09,599
comes from that is, like, just
knowing that you're not alone,

514
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,730
sort of. There's other people
kind of like going through

515
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,180
similar stuff. I think, there's
definitely just, like, powering

516
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:20,730
as, like, not feeling as alone.
Like, for me, especially when I

517
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,220
start doing talks on it, and
kind of like openly talking

518
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,759
about it. So, like, other people
responding by, like, "Hey,

519
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:28,874
I," you know, "I go through this
kind of similar stuff, too."

520
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:30,659
It's just,

521
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:36,269
like, it was kind-- maybe not--
I don't know. Good is the right

522
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:40,680
word to say, but more like,
just, it doesn't feel as bad

523
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,619
going through it, knowing that
you're not going through it by

524
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:44,220
yourself.

525
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,049
Bekah: For sure.

526
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,920
Cameron: It kinda like-- it kind
of shows how, like, the progress

527
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,309
isn't linear either. Like, it's
normal and honestly in some

528
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:54,039
ways, kind of important to have
back slides. And then- and then

529
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,170
show yourself that you can get
through them, you know? If you

530
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,970
feel like you've made progress,
and then you revert back for a

531
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,470
little bit, that's a normal part
of the process. And you

532
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,690
shouldn't-- you know, something
that I like to say is you

533
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,940
shouldn't feel bad about feeling
bad. Like, you don't have to

534
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,950
beat yourself up over your lack
of progress over thing, you

535
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,960
know, any of these

536
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,329
areas. So again, it's-- the
recovery, like, showing you that

537
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:15,309
you have-- showing yourself that
you have the strength to recover

538
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:17,079
from something like that is
really important as well.

539
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:22,220
Bekah: Yeah, I-- so, my journey
into tech started

540
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,009
with a trauma that I went
through. And so I talked a lot

541
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:29,990
about it. About having anxiety,
depression, PTSD, but, like, one

542
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,559
of the most pivotal moments for
me was when I was in bootcamp.

543
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:39,230
My educational coach—who was
assigned to me—and she said,

544
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,805
"Hey, can I share a story with
you?" I said, "Sure." And she

545
00:26:40,805 --> 00:26:42,380
said,

546
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,309
"I went through trauma too. I
was run over by a semi truck."

547
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,099
And that was the first person I
had ever talked to about

548
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:53,089
trauma. And our traumas were
very, very different. But all of

549
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:55,970
the words that she were saying,
they were the words that had

550
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,599
gone through my head so many
times. And I finally realized

551
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:04,519
that I wasn't alone. So, I had
spent so much time alone in- in

552
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:09,079
that- that- that just moment of
connection was enough to, like,

553
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:14,269
give me hope to keep going. And
that was-- my trauma was four

554
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:18,920
years ago. And I gave a talk
about it the other day. Told the

555
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,759
story many, many times. And I
just started crying, and I don't

556
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:24,709
ever cry. So, it was like on a
screen full of people, just

557
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,659
crying.

558
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,509
Couldn't get it- couldn't get it
together. And it was that

559
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:32,119
feeling of, like, being super
frustrated at myself. Like, why-

560
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,979
why is this happening now? And
the talk, that's recorded.

561
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:35,808
That's

562
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:37,879
gonna be on YouTube, right? And
so, like, I wrote a little post

563
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:39,949
on my

564
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,819
trauma blog about it. And
somebody messaged me, and she

565
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:45,859
said, "This is what I needed to
hear in this moment." Because

566
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:47,899
she

567
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,650
had also gone through a trauma
in a couple of years ago. And

568
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,734
suddenly, she was, like, hit
with that moment, too. And just

569
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:55,788
felt

570
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:59,329
like very frustrated with
herself. And so, it exactly what

571
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:02,390
you're saying, Cameron. It's,
like, it's not linear, right?

572
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:07,759
Like, there's gonna be waves and
somebody once said like, "It

573
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,665
doesn't go away, but it gets
different." And I think that,

574
00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:11,420
you

575
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,660
know, that might be specific to
trauma. But, you know, we find

576
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,690
these moments in our lives,
where we're like, "Man, I really

577
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,410
thought that I was passed this."
And that can be hard. But when

578
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,529
you connect with somebody else,
and you can kind of talk about

579
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:27,440
it together, then you realize,
like, "Okay," you know, like,

580
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,970
"We-- we've got this together."

581
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,759
Cameron: It can be helpful too
if you've been—like

582
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:34,334
you said—you've kind of-- you
hear your own words in your

583
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:35,909
head so much. And

584
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,519
maybe you don't know if it makes
sense. Because these things can

585
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,049
often be really hard to put
words to, because it's not

586
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:43,859
something that necessarily has,
like, a physical analogy for

587
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:46,140
everyone. So, if you can, like,
kind of say these words out

588
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,265
loud, and someone says, "Yeah,
no, that makes sense." That

589
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:48,390
makes

590
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,210
you feel a little less, I don't
know, lost sometimes. So--

591
00:28:54,118 --> 00:28:55,979
Bekah: Yeah. Also, I think, you
know, if we're

592
00:28:55,979 --> 00:29:00,898
talking technology too,
sometimes- sometimes you can

593
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:05,338
deny things to yourself, right?
But if the data is in front of

594
00:29:05,338 --> 00:29:09,028
you, like, "Okay, I've been
tracking my mood for this long,

595
00:29:09,028 --> 00:29:12,268
for the last however much time.
Maybe- maybe I'm not being

596
00:29:12,268 --> 00:29:15,508
honest

597
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:21,388
with myself about how bad I feel
right now--" or good. Maybe you

598
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:22,169
feel good, hopefully [laughs].

599
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,549
Cameron: People aren't good at,
like-- I don't know.

600
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:29,230
Maybe you're not-- it's not that
you're not being honest with

601
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,100
yourself. People just aren't
really that good at

602
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,970
self-evaluation.

603
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,589
It's just how human brains work.
So it's not- it's not

604
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:38,259
necessarily, like, intentional
or otherwise, like, deluding

605
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:40,420
yourself, or lying to yourself,
or whatever you want to call it.

606
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,759
It's just not an easy, normal
thing to do.

607
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,160
Dan: Mm-hmm. Yeah. And that kind
of circles back to some of

608
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,000
the cognitive behavioral therapy
stuff is your brain, like, will

609
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,610
actually actively lie to you
about al of things. Is-- yeah,

610
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:56,220
well,

611
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:58,769
like we said at the beginning,
we could probably all talk about

612
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:01,649
this for [laughs] a long, long,
long time. Kind of moving-

613
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:04,529
moving on.

614
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:08,910
So, you're both pretty busy. You
have a lot of side projects

615
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,690
going on and along with, you
know, career stuff, and family

616
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:17,910
stuff, school. So, we were
wondering how each of you sort

617
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,665
of balance your- your own mental
health, like, with- with work,

618
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:22,560
and with side projects, and
everything else that goes along

619
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,700
with being,

620
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:28,829
you know, a human in the, you
know, in 2021. Rahat, we'll

621
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:31,529
start with you. At a talk—one of
our lightning talks last

622
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:35,220
year—was sort of about some of
this. So, I start with you and

623
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:36,480
see what your thoughts were.

624
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:41,069
Rahat: Yeah. For me, I tend to
forget a lot of times to

625
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:44,670
really stop and just, like, not
work on all the different things

626
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:50,759
I'm working on for a little bit.
So, the way I've recently been

627
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:53,564
managing it is just, like,
trying to remember that, you

628
00:30:53,564 --> 00:30:56,369
know, I

629
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:59,910
have a daughter now. I need some
time for her, I need some time

630
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,160
for myself, I need some time to
just, like, unwind from

631
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,529
everything because there is a
ton of stuff I'm doing right

632
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:08,609
now. And it took-- it takes a
lot of work for me to, like, get

633
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:12,689
past

634
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:18,119
my own, I guess, self-imposed
deadlines on things that don't

635
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:24,900
actually mean anything. And the
way I had sort of tried to

636
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:28,094
accept a little exercise I do
just in my head is, like,

637
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,579
pretend

638
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:30,929
that, like, I'm a stakeholder in
a meeting, and I'm, like,

639
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:32,279
pushing

640
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,494
the state back a little bit,
like, "Hey, we don't need it

641
00:31:33,494 --> 00:31:34,709
till

642
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,880
this time." That's kinda--
that's something that kinda

643
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,050
works for

644
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,390
me a little

645
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:43,890
bit. And then those moments,
I'll try to let go and, like,

646
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:49,140
just take a walk or play some
video games, anything like

647
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:53,250
that, and just try to get away
from what I'm working on. And

648
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,929
just, like, also trying to
remind myself that if I wanna

649
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:56,608
work

650
00:31:56,609 --> 00:32:00,059
quickly through things, then I
need to take a break. Because

651
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:03,480
I've, like, gone through burnout
before, like, not being able to

652
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,950
do something for a couple
months. And just kind of like

653
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,945
getting it down in my head and
it was like, "If I don't stop

654
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:11,940
sometimes, and just,

655
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,920
like, take a breath, I won't be
able to continue doing as much

656
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:18,329
stuff as I hope to do."

657
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,119
Dan: Yeah, totally. I think
that's-- I mean, we've sort of

658
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,679
talked about this before, but I
think that-- that's, like, a

659
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,239
great-

660
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:32,789
a great thing to do consciously,
is sort of try to jam, like, not

661
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:34,680
jam those breaks into your
schedule. But, like, actually

662
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,259
schedule, you know, breaks in
and make sure you're taking care

663
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:40,619
of them. Cameron, do you have
anything, like-- I don't know,

664
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,525
specific thing you do to try to,
you know, take care of

665
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:43,920
yourself

666
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,464
or, you know, getting everything
done. And, you know, side

667
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,008
project thing and all that?

668
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,019
Cameron: Yeah, [unintelligible],
I guess. I'm

669
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:49,679
coming out with a bit of a

670
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:51,779
period where I've, like, been
bouncing around on a lot of

671
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:54,359
different things. Because about
a year ago, for a long time, I

672
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:56,880
was kind of torn between whether
I would do, like, science and

673
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,220
research or just go into tech.
And about a year ago, I finally

674
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,150
decided, "Okay, tech can be the
thing." So at that point, I

675
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,334
started doing, like, a bunch
more freelancing, and did a

676
00:33:04,334 --> 00:33:05,518
couple

677
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,614
internships, and side projects
and stuff. So it was like,

678
00:33:06,614 --> 00:33:07,709
"Okay.

679
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,120
Here's what I need to do again
to get into the tech industry."

680
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,500
And

681
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,599
then, you know, a couple weeks
ago, I just got hired full time.

682
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,690
So then, that period of, like,
doing a whole bunch of stuff and

683
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,059
bouncing around is kind of
settling down now. So, in back,

684
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,099
it's like reevaluating and
focusing on, "Okay, here's the

685
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:23,309
main things I need to do." Like,
"I need to do, like, this much.

686
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:25,799
Well, I need to work, you know,
40 hours a week. And I need to

687
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,579
do this much school, and then I
also need to exercise." So I've

688
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:32,940
been coming out of kind of a
chaotic period and settling into

689
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,710
more of a routine the past few
weeks, which isn't really nice

690
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,480
[laughs].

691
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:40,019
Yeah. But I still think that
that period of working hard was

692
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,534
important because I ended up,
you know, in a place that I

693
00:33:41,534 --> 00:33:43,049
really wanted to

694
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:45,509
get. And yeah, it was hard for a
while. But here I am.

695
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:49,499
Bekah: I think, too, when you
can see, this

696
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:53,308
isn't a forever thing. There--
this is going to end, then it

697
00:33:53,308 --> 00:33:56,638
makes it feel a little bit more
doable. But there's also this,

698
00:33:57,239 --> 00:34:00,479
like, natural tendency in tech.
I think tech just moves so

699
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:04,528
quickly, right? That people feel
this- this need to hustle all

700
00:34:04,528 --> 00:34:07,558
the time. And that's, like-- I
can't stand that word, hustle.

701
00:34:09,628 --> 00:34:13,528
But, like, to continue to keep
doing stuff all the time. And I

702
00:34:13,528 --> 00:34:17,938
find that as much as I don't
like that word, I have a really

703
00:34:17,938 --> 00:34:21,599
hard time turning off my brain
when there's always something to

704
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,163
be done because, you know, like,
tech moves fast and so do

705
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:27,239
people. So [laughs]--

706
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,780
Cameron: Yeah. I really kind of
like-- it's kind of a strong

707
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,960
word, but I kind of detest that
part of Twitter's, like, I don't

708
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,929
know. Silicon Valley-- like, VC
hustle porn kind of like—if

709
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:38,744
you're not working you're losing
money. I don't know. Everyone

710
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,559
should be the

711
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,570
founder kind of thing which is
not true. Not everyone should be

712
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:46,064
a founder. Being a founder kind
of sucks [laughs]. Yeah. And--

713
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:49,558
yeah, I don't

714
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,794
know. I just-- like, what you
said about having a deadline

715
00:34:51,794 --> 00:34:54,029
was-

716
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,484
was really stood out to me
because-- yeah, like, I had--

717
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:56,909
so, when

718
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,280
I made the decision to go into
tech, I had a year and a half

719
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,449
left in my degree. And I was
like, "Okay, so I'm going to

720
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:01,618
work really hard for

721
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:03,780
this next year and a half, and
then, I'm going to be settled

722
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,389
into a career, hopefully." And
having that deadline really

723
00:35:06,389 --> 00:35:08,639
helped. And then, when I got
hired full time, I had four

724
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,219
months left in my undergrad
degree. So just to make the full

725
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:12,689
time work, I stretched that out
into eight months. So, starting,

726
00:35:12,689 --> 00:35:14,159
you

727
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,509
know, in August, I'll be done
with school and just working.

728
00:35:15,509 --> 00:35:16,859
And

729
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,400
then, I feel like-- then, you
know, like I said, even now, I'm

730
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,500
working less hard than I was
three or four months ago. But

731
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,820
even past the summer, I'll be
pretty fully settled in just

732
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,929
having that in mind really
helps.

733
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:31,440
Bekah: Yeah. And I know, Rahat,
too, you have been

734
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,039
working on a book. And at some
point, you tweeted that you were

735
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:37,889
talking about, like, building a
mental health breaks, which I

736
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:42,239
just really loved that idea.
Because we're always focusing

737
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,469
on, like, you've got to learn-
you've got to learn fast.

738
00:35:43,469 --> 00:35:44,699
Bootcamps

739
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:47,940
are moving people through
quickly, everybody's looking for

740
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,739
jobs. And that idea of, like,
"Okay, you can learn, but let's

741
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:56,099
pause and take care of you." And
I just found that concept

742
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,349
really, really fascinating. Are
you-- is that make it-- does

743
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:00,599
it-- did

744
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:01,776
it make a place in-- does it
have a place-- oh my gosh. Does

745
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:02,953
that

746
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:06,570
have-- did-- I can't do it
[laughs].

747
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:10,559
Dan: [Laughs] Is that in your
book?

748
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,509
Rahat: [Laughs] Yeah. So, I've
definitely built it into

749
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:16,678
the chapters

750
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,794
I've been writing recently.
Like, at the end, depending on,

751
00:36:18,794 --> 00:36:20,909
like,

752
00:36:20,909 --> 00:36:24,329
what subject I cover in that
specific chapter, like, there's

753
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:27,869
one where talking about, like,
trying to find other people

754
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:30,239
similar-- like, in the same
journey as you are going into

755
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,099
tech and seeing, like, you know,
if you can band together to work

756
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:41,340
on some stuff. And at the end, I
kind of like-- I want to have,

757
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,619
like, a sort of, like, a norm-
kind of like an alert box type

758
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,074
thing at the end of, like,
"Hey," you know, "reaching out

759
00:36:45,074 --> 00:36:46,529
to people

760
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:51,900
can be hard. Talking to people
is pretty hard. Especially, if

761
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,849
you're like me, have some social
anxiety and stuff. And, you

762
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:00,659
know, if you've talked to a
couple people, great. You don't

763
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:03,900
have to keep doing it. Take a
break, just remember to take

764
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,340
care of yourself." Stuff like
that. And that-- there's a

765
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,780
little,

766
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:08,369
like, alerts, like, at the end
of each chapter like that, based

767
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:09,929
on

768
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:12,599
whatever we covered. It's just,
like, it's awesome that you're

769
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,869
doing this, but you should also
be taking care of yourself as

770
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:16,170
well.

771
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,380
Dan: That's really cool.

772
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:21,789
Cameron: Now that I remember
what Bekah said--

773
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:22,879
sorry, just to jump in quick.
Bekah said something that stood

774
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:23,969
out to me.

775
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:25,199
I guess, it's-- like, these
bootcamps and online-- different

776
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,429
online, you know,

777
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,785
learning platforms, whether it's
Udemy or, like, something

778
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:29,940
self-directed

779
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,219
like that, they kind of try to
push you through—like

780
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:34,619
you said—and finish quickly. And
that's-- they present it in

781
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,019
ways if that's good for you and
it's not as good to them. Then,

782
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:38,639
they can get more people in
[laughs] and charge more people

783
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:40,259
more money.

784
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,420
So yeah, of course, they have to
present that in a way that makes

785
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,170
it seem like it's for you, but
it's not.

786
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:47,070
Dan: Yeah, it seem-- that's
actually-- that's an interesting

787
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,369
point. And in the bootcamps,
from what I've heard, it seems

788
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:53,130
like they're either in a, like,
kind of class, like, they're--

789
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:56,159
where people are pushing and
pushing. Or it's either that,

790
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:58,394
or you're in the self-guided
path. And it—from what I've

791
00:37:58,394 --> 00:38:00,629
heard and

792
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,789
I don't have full experience
with this—but from what I've

793
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:06,119
heard, it's sort of like very
much on your own in a point, you

794
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,909
know? And so, you can go, try to
go faster, or you go slow, or

795
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:10,109
you lost, or whatever. But
you're sort of like drifting off

796
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:11,309
on

797
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:13,574
your own. I think, yeah,
getting- getting some- some of

798
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:15,839
that

799
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,690
thought into learning, like,
learning materials and learning,

800
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:24,869
you know, courses and programs,
it seems very important. A lot-

801
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:28,590
a lot of people struggling in
bootcamps—from what I've

802
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,420
learned over the last- over the
last year.

803
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,254
Rahat: Yeah. I think that's
definitely, like, a culture

804
00:38:33,254 --> 00:38:34,199
and a

805
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:39,360
lot of bootcamps that needs to
change. Because, yeah, we're

806
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,189
just kind of pushing and
pushing, and not reminding

807
00:38:41,189 --> 00:38:43,018
people to just

808
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:46,110
take a break. Like, I also do--
I'm a TA at a bootcamp,

809
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:49,170
part-time.

810
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,530
And, like, one of my students
was asking me like,

811
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,735
"How do I get better at
JavaScript? How do I, like, do

812
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:56,460
more stuff to,

813
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,139
you know, keep- keep building? I
tried to work on things every

814
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:06,449
single day, for X amount of
hours." And I'm just like, "Take

815
00:39:06,449 --> 00:39:07,709
a break sometimes and just let
the information kind of sink

816
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:08,969
in."

817
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,880
Because sometimes, you just need
to walk away from it to, like,

818
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,505
let yourself absorb it.
Sometimes, just, like, walking

819
00:39:14,505 --> 00:39:16,710
away

820
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,869
is, like, one of the best things
you can do to, like, solve a

821
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:22,019
problem. Like, there's countless
sign, I think, a lot of people

822
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:24,599
talking about it of, like, you
know, you're going through

823
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,179
trying to fix a bug, you don't
know what's going on. You walk

824
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:28,769
away, you come back, and you
know what's going on now because

825
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:30,359
you

826
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,750
need to refresh or you need to
just, like, step away sometimes.

827
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:35,550
Dan: Absolutely.

828
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,230
Cameron: Yeah. Motivation is,
like, a finite resource

829
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:37,769
[laughs].

830
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,780
Dan: Yeah, yeah. I feel like
that- that go take a walk is- is

831
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,829
gotta be, like, when people are
having a, you know, when people

832
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:49,079
are like, "I can't figure this
thing out," you know? It's like

833
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,239
when you're doing tech support,
you need the first question is,

834
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:52,694
"When did you turn it off and
turn it back on again," right?

835
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:54,149
And so,

836
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,869
when you do, like, bug support,
you're like, "Okay. Did you- did

837
00:39:57,869 --> 00:39:59,670
you take a walk? Have you
stepped away from the computer

838
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,710
yet? [Laughs] Step away from the
computer and come back. And then

839
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,750
let's

840
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,010
see if you're still having the
same problem [laughs]."

841
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:09,360
Bekah: It's so hard to-- I
think, in bootcamps,

842
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:12,659
there's that sense of loneliness
and lack of community,

843
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:16,949
especially for online bootcamps
with self-paced students that

844
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:20,760
don't prioritize community. And
then you- you find that problem.

845
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,169
So, you can take a walk, and
come back, and have nobody to

846
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,578
ask,

847
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:26,519
right? And so, that's, like,
bootcamps come with built-in

848
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,439
loneliness, like-- I don't know,
that needs to be [laughs]

849
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:30,900
advertised or something.

850
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:35,099
Cameron: Yeah. Meg-- in our
Slack at VC, Meg was talking

851
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,779
about that a lot. How she's
doing the self-guided bootcamp.

852
00:40:36,779 --> 00:40:38,459
And that she can't

853
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,800
do it as fast as some of her
peers because she's working at

854
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,090
the same time. So she's kind of
fell behind, like, the people

855
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,380
she

856
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,929
started with, just for lack of
time. And then, I think that

857
00:40:45,929 --> 00:40:48,239
contributed to some of your
dissatisfaction.

858
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,429
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. She's one
of the people I was

859
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:52,979
thinking about. Marie was--
while she was on the podcast a

860
00:40:52,979 --> 00:40:55,439
couple

861
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,300
episodes ago, but was talking
about-- she did a-- like the

862
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,090
scheduled one, right? But they
didn't have a lot of support.

863
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,340
And she was struggling. And so,
she basically strong armchair

864
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,080
class into doing study groups.
And they all found it-- you

865
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,820
know,

866
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,170
I mean, they all found it very
valuable, you know? But it was

867
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,250
not a program thing, you know?
It was- it was Marie, doing it,

868
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,500
because she wanted the support.
And it turned out other people,

869
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,610
you know, found it valuable too.

870
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:22,184
Cameron: It's the same way I
pass, like, undergrad.

871
00:41:22,184 --> 00:41:23,459
[Laughs] Just

872
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,849
having groups of people to study
with-- you know, that went

873
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:28,769
away for a lot of people in the
pandemic. And I can't imagine

874
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:31,079
what it would have been like as
the first year you're going into

875
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,459
do that, you know? And the only
way I passed, you know, second

876
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:33,839
year

877
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,249
calculus is because I was doing
it with a group of friends

878
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:36,658
[laughs]. So

879
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:38,309
yeah, I definitely feel bad for
those people.

880
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,750
Bekah: I was talking to a mom
recently, and I

881
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,265
don't remember she's going
through a bootcamp or a

882
00:41:44,265 --> 00:41:45,780
self-taught.

883
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:53,519
She's doing, like, a guided--
can't talk today [laughs]. Can't

884
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:58,829
remember if she is self-taught
or doing a bootcamp. But one of

885
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:00,599
the things she was saying was,
"It's just so hard to find

886
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,369
time,"

887
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,579
you know? A lot of moms are at
home with kids right now

888
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:08,909
because of the pandemic, and
there's no childcare. And so

889
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:12,599
she's saying, "Yeah," you know,
like, "I guide my students do

890
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,284
their schoolwork all day, and
then I stay up from, like,

891
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:17,969
twelve

892
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,099
thirty until three thirty, and
then I've got to get up at

893
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:22,198
seven," you know? And

894
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:26,760
it's like, "Okay. Let-- let's
break this down a little bit and

895
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,969
figure out something that's-
that's doable and maintainable,

896
00:42:29,969 --> 00:42:32,549
and that allows you to get
rest." Because a rested brain is

897
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:35,129
going

898
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:38,550
to absorb the material more.
But, you know, there's this

899
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:44,039
pressure to continue to go all
the time, despite everything

900
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:48,000
else. And you, I don't know, you
can't really strong-arm your way

901
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,260
through-- well, I was gonna say
through- through lack of sleep,

902
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,955
but parenthood that kind of
makes you do that. So maybe you

903
00:42:53,955 --> 00:42:55,650
can [laughs]--

904
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,664
Dan: [Laughs] Anyway, that also,
you know, confirms that

905
00:42:58,664 --> 00:42:59,879
it's not a good

906
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,530
idea by the end of the choices
you're making after four weeks

907
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:11,159
of not sleeping. It's good stuff
though [laughs].

908
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:18,000
Bekah: So, I've been doing,
like, a deep dive into

909
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:22,980
deep learning and mental health.
And I've been, like, very, very

910
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,300
fascinated by all of the
different ways that they are

911
00:43:27,329 --> 00:43:31,110
approaching mental health with
technology and how I think

912
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:38,309
that's gonna provide more
individualistic care for- for

913
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:42,360
people, and address, like, I
think, you know, really

914
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,010
understanding what mental health
looks like. And so I think that

915
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:49,829
that's really exciting. But I
also feel like, you know,

916
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:53,039
there's this- this tendency,
like, "I'm so excited about this

917
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,480
thing" but you're gonna have to
wait forever for it to come out

918
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,660
and to apply- to apply it to
your own life. But I think that,

919
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,840
you

920
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,159
know, all of these little things
that bring us hope can be really

921
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,800
useful. I don't know if there's
anything that you found that

922
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,255
you're like, "Yes, this is
really helpful," whether it's

923
00:44:12,255 --> 00:44:13,710
for you,

924
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:18,840
or someone you know, or for your
projects in terms of tech and

925
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,699
mental health, but I'd love to
hear about it.

926
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:24,630
Cameron: I don't have anything--
you know, anything,

927
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,820
like, deep learning or AI or
anything like that. I did take

928
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,650
some of my own trend data and
kind of feed it into a

929
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,989
prediction engine in a
classification engine, just to

930
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:32,399
see if I can find, you know,
anything. I didn't find anything

931
00:44:32,399 --> 00:44:33,809
that's

932
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:34,799
useful, mostly because my data
is, like, pretty one

933
00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:35,789
dimensional.

934
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,280
But yeah, I don't-- nothing that
I've used personally comes right

935
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,780
to mind. But like you said, you
know, we're kind of using our

936
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,300
own experiences to look at these
things. And you said, well,

937
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:47,309
maybe it'll take a long time for
these to come out and be

938
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:50,519
available to use ourselves but--
or we could use our experiences

939
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:52,589
to build them for, you know, the
next group of people. And they

940
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:54,659
can improve

941
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:56,699
upon what we build. I think
that's kind of the dream of the

942
00:44:56,699 --> 00:44:58,679
tech industry is that things
keep improving. So, [laughs]

943
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,659
hopefully. We'll

944
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:01,260
see how it goes.

945
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:05,159
Rahat: Yeah, deep learning stuff
is cool. We

946
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:08,668
actually, like, one component of
our app is, like, the whole

947
00:45:08,668 --> 00:45:11,938
reminder of something, you know,
relevant to what you're going

948
00:45:11,938 --> 00:45:18,809
through right now. And we're
building this with, like, AWS

949
00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:23,369
Amplify, which gives us access
to a couple cool like machine

950
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:28,048
learning stuff that they have
kind of built-in. And right now,

951
00:45:28,048 --> 00:45:30,929
we're kind of like trying to
figure out the best way to kind

952
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:35,338
of compare one entry that you're
not having a good day on

953
00:45:35,338 --> 00:45:40,259
to something that's, like,
relevant, but you did have a

954
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:44,278
good day on to remind you of
stuff. So, while we're kind of

955
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:48,869
like using that—I guess API for
now—what we kind of want to do

956
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:52,438
eventually is probably build
something of our own based on,

957
00:45:52,438 --> 00:45:57,509
like, what our users are
actually going through. So we

958
00:45:57,509 --> 00:46:00,208
have someone on board who's kind
of like leading that a little

959
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:07,139
bit. And, yeah, I think there's
a lot of room to do some cool

960
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,148
stuff with deep learning and
mental health.

961
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:15,329
Dan: That's pretty interesting.
I know I keep

962
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:18,659
coming back to the cognitive
therapy stuff. But, like, yet--

963
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,650
like, adding that little aspect
into it. And you're saying,

964
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:26,699
like, for example, you're, like,
you're really upset because you

965
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:29,460
feel like you can't do a thing
or something. And then the app

966
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,349
can be like, well, here--
actually, here's proof that you

967
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:32,879
have done [laughs] a similar
thing, you know, like, six times

968
00:46:32,879 --> 00:46:34,409
in the

969
00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:37,800
past, like, since we've started,
you know, working together, or

970
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,629
something like that, that could
be really-- I don't know. Really

971
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:41,429
valuable.

972
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,300
Rahat: Yeah, definitely.

973
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,980
Bekah: Always-- you know, like,
after I finally

974
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:54,570
felt like I was a-- had my
trauma under control, I always

975
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:58,199
would talk to people about this
idea of, like, having this

976
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,619
experience in your back pocket,
like, "Look, I was able to make

977
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:06,269
it through this. And it was
really challenging for a period

978
00:47:06,269 --> 00:47:09,929
of time. But I've developed
these tools or, like, I know

979
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,719
that I need community, or I know
that this is going to be a

980
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:17,309
trigger for me to predict some
of those things." But at the

981
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:21,750
beginning of the pandemic, I
found myself, again, frustrated

982
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:26,670
with myself because I thought,
you know, so much of what I feel

983
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,389
like I'm going through, like, I
lost my job, my kids were at

984
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:34,469
home, and I was supervising
their schooling. And I just felt

985
00:47:34,469 --> 00:47:37,559
like really isolated and alone.
I'm like, "I have navigated

986
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:39,209
through this before. But I'm
crying every single night."

987
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:40,859
Like,

988
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:45,809
"What- what-- why- why can't I
make it through this?" And- and,

989
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:47,789
like, ultimately, what I
remembered was, "Hey, community

990
00:47:47,789 --> 00:47:49,769
plays

991
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:52,829
a really big role in that,
right?" And so that's- that's

992
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:55,710
how Virtual Coffee was started.
Because I was like, "Hey, anyone

993
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:59,760
want to get together? Because I
feel really lonely." But then,

994
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:05,670
also, recognizing that I wasn't
the only one going through the

995
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:08,789
experience of the pandemic and
the effects of it. Like,

996
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:13,409
everybody was experiencing it.
And that's very different from

997
00:48:13,409 --> 00:48:18,150
navigating your own situation.
And so, you know, I think—for

998
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,869
me at least—I have this tendency
to be really frustrated

999
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:27,119
with myself when I think, like,
I should have the skills or the

1000
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,940
tools or whatever to make it
through this. But also, not

1001
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:35,159
every experience is the same.
And that's gonna vary from time

1002
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:39,480
to time. So there's learning new
things, and there's growing as a

1003
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,769
person. And I think that, you
know, being able to share those

1004
00:48:43,769 --> 00:48:45,119
things and the first couple
virtual coffees, that's what

1005
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,409
they were. It was like, "I'm
frustrated, there's a pandemic,

1006
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,480
and I'm very sad about it right
now." But that's what creates

1007
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,619
that, like, closeness and that
ability for vulnerability and,

1008
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:01,469
you know, for- for other people
to be able to share their

1009
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:02,460
stories as well.

1010
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:04,559
Dan: Word! [Laughs]

1011
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:09,899
Bekah: [Laughs] Sorry. I feel
like I did a monologue. You

1012
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,619
can cut that.

1013
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:13,050
Cameron: No, don't cut that.

1014
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:14,429
Rahat: Yeah, that was awesome.

1015
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:15,929
Dan: No, I think it was great. I
just didn't have

1016
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:16,889
anything really to add.

1017
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:17,940
Rahat: And not to add. Yeah.
[Laughs]

1018
00:49:23,909 --> 00:49:28,739
Dan: Okay. So, wrapping up. I
guess just the last question

1019
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:33,599
that is a little more general.
We, in Virtual Coffee, talk a

1020
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,840
lot about, you know, finding
teams and, you know, find a job

1021
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,440
and stuff like that. So when
you're thinking about either

1022
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,159
joining a company or creating a
team to work on a project, what

1023
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:46,784
is- what is, like, a
characteristic, what-- just-

1024
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:49,409
just, like, pick one,

1025
00:49:49,409 --> 00:49:53,460
but what is one characteristic
that you value in people- in

1026
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,789
people you work with? We'll
start with Rahat.

1027
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,750
Rahat: Yeah, I mean, I've been
recently applying for

1028
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,349
jobs and stuffs. So, one thing
I've been kind of like asking a

1029
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:07,289
lot about is, like, how the
culture is in terms of, like,

1030
00:50:07,289 --> 00:50:11,010
pair programming. I love, like,
learning things from, like, my

1031
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:15,989
experience steps. So if there's,
like, a environment for that,

1032
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:20,369
that's definitely something
super important to me. I've had

1033
00:50:20,369 --> 00:50:21,434
a couple of companies tell me
straight up that, "Yeah, we

1034
00:50:21,434 --> 00:50:22,499
don't

1035
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,924
really have time for that."
Like, "Hmm, probably don't want

1036
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:25,348
to continue

1037
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:28,724
with you then." So, yeah. I
mean, I feel like that kind of,

1038
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:32,099
like,

1039
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:36,179
shows you a little bit about
how, you know, senior devs kind

1040
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:41,039
of like support the more junior
ones. And I guess the overall

1041
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:46,650
team dynamic of, like, having
that willingness to just, like,

1042
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:49,530
hop on a call or something with
somebody and help them through a

1043
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:50,070
problem.

1044
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,268
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. I found
with pair programming, too,

1045
00:50:54,269 --> 00:50:56,114
it's- it's sometimes-- it's a
top down issue, right? You know?

1046
00:50:56,114 --> 00:50:57,959
So-

1047
00:50:57,989 --> 00:51:00,224
so, like, you could have a
senior developer be willing--

1048
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,459
or, you

1049
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,380
know, willing to talk and
willing to do stuff like that.

1050
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,659
But when you phrase it as, like,
pair programming, then

1051
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:08,114
management gets jumpy because
two people, like-- in their

1052
00:51:08,114 --> 00:51:09,569
mind, two people are

1053
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:13,530
working on the same problem or
whatever. So, yeah. I think

1054
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,360
that's- that's really important
to think about when you're

1055
00:51:15,869 --> 00:51:18,179
finding people to work with.
Cameron, what about you?

1056
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,730
Cameron: Yeah, that was a good
one. One thing I noticed,

1057
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:23,190
I was doing a bunch of
interviewing. I interviewed at a

1058
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:25,380
lot of places even-- something
like that. I was pretty sure I

1059
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,900
would take a job just to kind of
find out what the tech industry

1060
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,090
was like because I didn't really
know. And one thing I

1061
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,699
noticed was-- that kind of stood
out to me with some places don't

1062
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:34,559
ever talk about, like, the
products they're building. And

1063
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:35,789
if you [laughs] can't really
tell if they care about what

1064
00:51:35,789 --> 00:51:37,019
they're

1065
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:40,590
building or if they want to be
good. And yeah, I just

1066
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:43,289
really wanted to build something
where, like, everybody wanted to

1067
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,440
actually make it good. You know,
even if it was something that

1068
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,614
would have just be an internal
tool or, you know, something

1069
00:51:48,614 --> 00:51:50,218
that's in

1070
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:52,409
kind of like a boring industry,
like, I still want to make

1071
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:54,869
something that's nice to use,
and looks good, and supports

1072
00:51:54,869 --> 00:51:58,380
accessibility, and all these
things. See? I kind of-- I was

1073
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:03,119
definitely more willing to talk
to people who seem to care and

1074
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,449
know a lot about the product and
want to continually improve it

1075
00:52:06,449 --> 00:52:08,909
instead of just, I don't know,
make it good enough.

1076
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,050
Dan: Yeah, I think that's- I
think that's great. I feel like

1077
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:16,469
that's usually a good sign that,
like, people are invested in it

1078
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,690
too. And don't have a lot of
turnover, you know, if you have

1079
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:20,249
a new- new people that are
coming and going all the time,

1080
00:52:20,249 --> 00:52:21,808
then you can't,

1081
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:23,849
like, build any connection to
it, right? So--

1082
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,174
Cameron: Yeah. It's kinda
surprising you. Especially

1083
00:52:25,174 --> 00:52:26,448
a lot of the startups

1084
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:27,664
was working at-- I thought they
were all, like, deeply care

1085
00:52:27,664 --> 00:52:28,879
about,

1086
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,219
like, the thing that they're
building, but they didn't.

1087
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,899
Dan: They deep- deeply? Yeah.
Maybe deeply care about

1088
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,038
the project, but--

1089
00:52:35,449 --> 00:52:36,079
Cameron: Maybe they deeply care
about the money they

1090
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:36,709
were making? Yeah [laughs].

1091
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,739
Bekah: Awesome. Thanks for being
here. We really

1092
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:45,739
enjoyed having this
conversation. But before we

1093
00:52:45,739 --> 00:52:49,340
leave, can you let us know if
there's anything you're up to?

1094
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,199
Or how our listeners can find
you?

1095
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:53,780
Cameron: Sure, yeah. You can
always-- you can find me at

1096
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,050
Virtual Coffee, obviously, twice
a week. You can find me on

1097
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:00,260
Twitter, @CameronBardell. And
that's where you can see me

1098
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,780
doing most of my stuff, kind of.
I don't have a lot of time for

1099
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,030
doing, like, open source work
right now. But I hope to get

1100
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:07,250
started back up in the next few
months. So yeah.

1101
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,940
Rahat: Yeah. You can also find
me on Virtual Coffee.

1102
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:14,659
I usually come to the afternoon
meetings. And, yeah, I'm on

1103
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:19,340
Twitter, @Rahatcodes. And if
you're into open source and

1104
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,449
stuff, definitely looking for
some contributors to my mental

1105
00:53:20,449 --> 00:53:23,869
health project. So, definitely
check that out.

1106
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:25,519
Bekah: Awesome.

1107
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:26,989
