00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,391
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 6, Episode 5

2
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:10,691
of the

2
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:16,100
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,821
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:22,640
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:25,850
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,431
stories, and what they've learned.
And we are here to share it with

7
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:30,830
you here with me. Today is my
cohost, Dan.

8
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:39,831
Dan Ott: Waddup, Bek? [Bekah
laughs] How is it going today?

9
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:43,191
Bekah: Just never know- never
know what -- how you're going to

10
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:49,070
deliver that. It is- is going
amazingly fantastic today.

11
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:53,000
Dan: That is impressive.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,300
Bekah: Yep.

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,625
Dan: That's good. Cuz today we had

12
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,295
an amazingly fantastic guest,
Chad Stewart.

13
00:00:58,731 --> 00:00:59,810
Bekah: Who is also awesome.

14
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:02,000
Dan: He's a software -- he is
also awesome. Yeah. We -- that's

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
obvious because he is on our
podcast. So-

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,200
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,855
Dan: -like, you know, we just
assumed-

16
00:01:04,445 --> 00:01:05,676
Bekah: Yeah. It was implied.

17
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:06,500
Dan: -at this point. Yeah.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:06,800
Bekah: Yeah.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,275
Dan: But yeah, he's a --
Chad's a software

18
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:13,865
engineer from Kingston, Jamaica.
And, yeah, we had a good time

19
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,135
talking to him. And he talked a
lot about his experience with

20
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:22,700
open source and also his ... I
don't know what you call-

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,135
Bekah: Project?

21
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:25,000
Dan: -he's got a newsletter --
his sort of project. Yeah.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,536
Called Tech

22
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:29,700
is Hiring. And ... I don't know.
He told us a lot about- a lot

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,305
about that and

23
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:32,585
how- how he got into that. And,
you know, how it works and stuff

24
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:33,066
is- is very cool.

25
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:36,066
Bekah: Yeah. I love how
organically it started. You know,

26
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:40,626
he saw a need for something that
in the wider tech industry. And

27
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:43,715
then somebody mentioned to him
like, "Hey, what do you think

28
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:48,006
about doing something more with
this?" And he just went with that.

29
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:50,825
And I think that's a really great
way to find inspiration and

30
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:52,475
energy from the things that
you're doing.

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,290
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. I mean,
it's always good to talk to Chad.

32
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,355
He's- he's very funny. He's- he's
one of our main contributors to

33
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:04,000
our humor channel [Bekah and Dan
chuckle] in- in- in our Slack.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,575
And yeah, it- it was

34
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:09,725
fascinating hearing about his-
his experience with all that

35
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:11,705
stuff. And with, the- the Open
Sauced. That was the other --

36
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:14,000
that's the big project that he
volunteers with --

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,316
contributes with.

37
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:18,485
And he talked a lot about
how you don't have to be writing

38
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:23,015
code to contribute to an open
source project. And I -- both

39
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:25,000
agree with that [chuckles] very
much and- and appreciate the-

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,366
the way he talked about his
experiences with that.

41
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:31,985
Bekah: Yeah. And we start
this episode of podcast like

42
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,866
we start every Virtual Coffee. We
introduce ourselves with our

43
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:37,776
name, where we're from, what we
do, and a random check-in

44
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:49,097
question. We hope you enjoy this
episode. Our random check-in

45
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:52,787
question is, if you could have any
animal for a pet, what would it

46
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:52,997
be?

47
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:54,187
Chad Stewart: Cheetah.

48
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:56,956
Bekah: [Chuckles] Not yet.

49
00:02:57,676 --> 00:02:57,977
Chad: [Dan laughs] Oh.

50
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:00,887
Bekah: And how is it not a
penguin? That's what I wanna

51
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:01,037
know.

52
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:05,796
Chad: I like cheetahs. It'd
be cheetah or a peregrine falcon.

53
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:07,157
Those are my favorite animals.

54
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:08,602
Dan: Mm.

54
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:12,592
Bekah: All right. My name is
Bekah. I am a technical community

55
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,372
builder from a small town in
Ohio. And if I could have any

56
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:24,382
animal for a pet ... I really
like red pandas and ring-tailed

57
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:29,662
lemurs. So those are on the top
of the list, But a falcon seems

58
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:33,532
like it would be pretty cool.
I've already got a skinny pig. So

59
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:37,252
I feel like half of my dreams
have been fulfilled already.

60
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:41,373
Dan: Yeah, that thing is
horrifying [chuckles].

61
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:42,979
Bekah: No, cute. It's adorable.

62
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:45,334
Dan: It's not -- the -- they're
supposed to have fur [laughs].

63
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:47,000
Bekah: No.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500
Dan: It's like it has a --
something --

65
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,700
Bekah: It doesn't- it doesn't
have fur.

66
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,000
Dan: Well, I know it doesn't. 

64
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:51,000
Bekah: It's a tiny hippopotamus.
So if you're not-

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,500
Dan: [Chuckles] It's not.

66
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,818
Bekah: -familiar with what a
skinny pig

65
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:56,299
is, it is a hairless Guinea pig
that looks like a tiny hippo.

66
00:03:57,859 --> 00:03:59,700
Super cute. Google it.

67
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,000
Dan: [Laughs] It's- it's --

68
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,000
Bekah: It is so cute, Dan.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,500
Dan: It's really weird.

70
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,588
Bekah: Stop it. Stop hating on
my pet.

68
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:05,824
Dan: I mean, this is from a
person who likes the hairless

69
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:06,153
cats too. So [unintelligible].

70
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:07,188
Bekah: Love hairless cats.
They're amazing.

71
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:09,183
Dan: They're like the most
horrifying thing in the world.

72
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:10,938
Bekah: No, they're not. They're
so great. Especially when they're

73
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:12,889
angry looking, they're just like
great.

74
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:22,300
Dan: That ... [laughs] I don't
know. Okay. Hi, I'm Dan. I am a

75
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,814
developer of computer

75
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:31,353
things [laughs]. I live in
Cleveland, Ohio. Yeah. So are we

76
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:33,064
sticking with real world animals?

77
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,403
Bekah: No. If you want a mini
dragon, you can have one.

78
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:39,783
Dan: A mini dragon? I was gonna
say the dragon guy from "The

79
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:42,274
Neverending Story", although he
is like a little --

80
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:43,500
Chad: Falkor?

81
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,264
Bekah: Falkooor.

81
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:48,588
Dan: Yeah, Falkor. I was
gonna say, what's the word

82
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:52,000
for like, when you -- when a
person like a- a being can,

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,238
like, talk, and think and stuff?

84
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:55,434
Bekah: An anthropomorphism?

85
00:04:55,579 --> 00:05:00,000
Dan: No, no, no. Like a- like a
conscious or, you know, like he

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,769
has -- he's a

86
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:04,309
little too much of a human --
not a human, but like a thinking

87
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:05,358
thing to be, like have a pet --

88
00:05:05,374 --> 00:05:07,274
Bekah: Yeah. He's an
anthropomorphized

89
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,000
[unintelligible] --

89
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,978
Dan: I- I know. But I'm saying,
like- I'm saying, like, since --

90
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:11,869
Chad: It seems it got a taxpayer
to me. To know [inaudible].

91
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:13,500
Dan: [Laughs] It's a word --
there's a word, for what I'm

92
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:13,819
looking for.

92
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:16,900
And I- I- I can't think of the
word. But what I mean is like,

93
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,163
I would

93
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:19,803
feel bad keeping him as a pet
because he has like too much of

94
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:22,834
his own, you know, consciousness.
You know what I mean? Like, he

95
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:25,504
like talks and he is like his own
thing. So I don't think he'd

96
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:27,454
wanna be a pet. And that would
make me sad.

97
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,598
Bekah: Well, like what about dogs
that run away all the time? Did

98
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:31,608
they really wanna be pet? Should
they be free too?

99
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:38,700
Dan: I mean, I don't know
[chuckles]. I mean, that's a

100
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,004
good question.

100
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:42,153
Should any pets be pets, you
know? Yeah. Yeah.

101
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:43,699
Bekah: I -- it's one of those
moral conundrums.

102
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:46,700
Dan: I mean, if you truly love
it, then set it free and it'll-

00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,500
Bekah: They comes back [laughs]?

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,994
Dan: -come back or something?
How does that go [laughs]?

104
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:50,000
Bekah: If they comes back, it's
yours.

105
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,000
Dan: Alright.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,769
Bekah: And that's how you know.

105
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:53,800
That is lyrics in a Christina
Aguilera's song.

106
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,000
Dan: Mm.

106
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,199
Bekah: I refrain from singing it
for you.

107
00:05:57,363 --> 00:06:02,043
Dan: Ah, oh, man. All right.
Anyway, that's my answer. I'm-

108
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:04,300
I'm going -- i-if we have to
stick with real world, I'd say

109
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:04,613
sloth though.

109
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:06,000
Sloths are really cool. And, you
know-

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,700
Bekah: Oh, yeah.

111
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,983
Dan: -and I'd like -- I'd
totally

110
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:09,800
like just chill in the backyard
with the sloth. If it's-

111
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,000
Bekah: I was --

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,874
Dan: -real world- real world
animal. That's- that's my answer.

112
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:16,353
Bekah: I was in Costa Rica when I
was like 19 or 20, and that was a

113
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:19,153
highlight to get -- to see the
three toed and the two toed

114
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:19,483
sloths.

115
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:20,524
Dan: [Whispers] Oh, yeah. Nice.

116
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:23,014
Bekah: Welcome, Chad [chuckles].

117
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:24,423
Dan: [Laughs] Yeah. Go ahead,
Chad.

118
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:28,983
Chad: Oh, yeah. So I-I'm Chad
Stewart. I'm a software

119
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:28,983
engineer in --

119
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:32,524
cu-currently in Kingston,
Jamaica, mostly do front-end

120
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:37,084
engineering stuff. Right now
though, hopefully

121
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:40,264
transitioning to doing more
full-stack stuff. And I guess I

122
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:42,634
answered this earlier, but it
would be either a cheetah or

123
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:46,564
peregrine falcon. Those are my
favorite animals. They're fast. I

124
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:51,423
like fast animals. I don't know.
Yeah. And I like birds

125
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:56,074
which Bekah might have --
Bekah alluded too earlier

126
00:06:56,074 --> 00:06:58,894
with a different type of bird.
But yeah [chuckles].

127
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,738
Dan: [Chuckles] Did you ever
read -- either of you ever read

128
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:04,418
"My Side of the Mountain"?

129
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:05,728
Bekah: Yes.

130
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:06,783
Chad: I- I did not.

131
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,454
Dan: You read that, Chad? So it's
a -- it's like a- it's like a young

132
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:12,603
adult book, I think. But it- it's
about a kid who runs away and

133
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,574
goes and lives in the woods, like
with- with nothing, you know? And

134
00:07:15,574 --> 00:07:19,144
teaches himself how to so-sort of
forage, and hunt, and fish or

135
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:24,004
whatever. And he eventually like
goes and get -- like, steals a

136
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:27,514
falcon baby from a nest and- and
then, like, raises it and trains

137
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,524
it. And be -- it becomes his,
like, friend and stuff. It's

138
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:34,300
really cool. Anyway, that- that
sounds cool. It would be- it

139
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,788
would be really cool

139
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,968
to have a falcon as- as a pet.
And like, could just like hang

140
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:41,509
out with you on your shoulder?
Is that what -- do you think

141
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:43,098
you'd do shoulder or just do
your arm thing? I dunno if

142
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:44,000
on arm is possible.

142
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:46,264
Chad: Depends on the falcon.
I'm, you know, considering the

143
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:49,324
talents, it would probably not
necessarily rest on your shoulder

144
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:50,824
and rest in your shoulder, you
know what I mean?

145
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,158
Dan: [Laughs] Right, right.
[Unintelligible] little --

146
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,918
Bekah: Like a very leather
shoulder pad or something.

147
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,000
Dan: Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Little contraption for him to

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,024
hang out on. Feel like

148
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:01,173
you'd wanna like, hang, you know?
Keep you -- keep him with you when-

149
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:03,274
when he's not -- like, when he's
not cruising around.

150
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:07,488
Bekah: If I am ever famous and I
go to an award show, I'm gonna

151
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:11,569
come with a falcon on my
shoulder. I just decided it.

152
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:11,733
Seems like the [unintelligible].

153
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:13,564
Dan: You're keynoting a conference.
You should do it there.

154
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:17,298
Bekah: [Laughs] I don't think I
have enough time to train a

155
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:17,500
falcon.

156
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:17,700
Dan: Mm.

157
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,759
Bekah: I've got, like, three
weeks.

156
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:21,274
Dan: That's not enough time.

157
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:22,668
Bekah: I don't know.

158
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:25,249
Dan: Well, yeah. This episode
will come out after that anyway.

159
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:29,478
So, next time you're the
keynote speaker at a conference,

160
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,000
that'll be -- you just put that
in the -- on the plan [laughs].

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,300
Bekah: That'll be my thing.

162
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:34,500
Dan: Yeah.

163
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,083
Bekah: Kirk says my thing is
crying while I give

162
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,203
talks. And that is the thing I
would like to not be doing. I

163
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:43,000
would rather be the- the Falcon
shoulder person [Bekah and Dan

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,504
laugh]. Welcome, Chad. This

164
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:54,288
is- this is the normal intro for
us. And it is a Friday that

165
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:55,700
we are recording on. So-

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,300
Dan: Yeah.

167
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,129
Bekah: -brains don't work on
Fridays.

166
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:00,700
Everybody knows that. So
[laughs] you're gonna have to

167
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,879
bear with us today.

167
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:06,109
But we will -- we'll give you
the mic now. So you don't have to

168
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:09,349
listen to me talk anymore. We
always love to hear your origin

169
00:09:09,354 --> 00:09:12,708
story. How did you come into tech
and get to this point in your

170
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:13,249
tech journey?

171
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:19,594
Chad: Yeah, so, I guess I
give a kind of quick synopsis of-

172
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:26,614
of what I did. So, I moved to
the United States for some

173
00:09:26,614 --> 00:09:30,528
time. To be honest, to- to go
to art school because I wanted to

174
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:34,849
be a- a game developer and I -- but
I couldn't draw very well at the

175
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:38,599
time. So I ended up into another
program, which effectively was

176
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:42,168
web design. Whatever this -- it
was The Art Institute of Fort

177
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:45,438
Lauderdale. And it was whatever
they had kinda called web design.

178
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:49,009
And I did that for some time,
graduated, and then found I

179
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:52,800
didn't necessarily like web
design directly. Or at least,

180
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,479
what it was

180
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:58,698
at the time. And so I ended up
going back to another school.

181
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:01,700
I'm pretty sure the South
Floridians would kind of

00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,269
know the schools

182
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,389
that I'm talking about. Well,
people know Art Institute. But

183
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,259
for the South Floridians, I went
back to NSU, Nova

184
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:13,788
Southeastern University, got a- a
software engineering degree from

185
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:19,908
there. And then did some work,
ended up returning home, and

186
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:24,469
have been kinda working around
ever since. During the

187
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:29,734
pandemic, I was unemployed. And
that's how I came across, you

188
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:33,933
know, Bekah, and Dan, and Virtual
Coffee when they were- when

189
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,443
they were hosting -- well, they're
still hosting [laughs]. They're still

190
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:41,553
hosting Zoom- Zoom calls. But
that's how I came across them.

191
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:48,423
And I've mostly been kinda
active on Twitter. So I s- I,

192
00:10:48,423 --> 00:10:53,076
you know, I met- I met Dan and-
a-a-and Bekah during 2020, um,

193
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:59,614
2020, 2021. I decided to
start an organization called

194
00:10:59,614 --> 00:11:04,984
Tech is Hiring. Te- pretty
much what I do is I retweet job

195
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:10,984
opportunities as I come across
them on Twitter. And I re- re --

196
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:15,484
I also retweet people
looking for- for opportunities.

197
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:20,764
And so I've been doing that for
about -- for- for a little bit

198
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:25,500
over a year now. And... yeah.
Like -- that's pretty much it.

199
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:25,923
We- we do have --

199
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:31,563
we have some presence on
LinkedIn, but mostly still on

200
00:11:31,563 --> 00:11:36,274
Twitter. Have a newsletter,
been doing the newsletter thing.

201
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:38,403
Haven't missed a week. I'm
actually pretty happy about that.

202
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:43,879
But have- have been doing a
newsletter for a couple of

203
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:47,568
months now. I think over six
months now. And yeah, that's

204
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:51,769
pretty much -- yeah. I'm working
now, you know, thankfully. And

205
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:56,089
my opportunities are increasing
because of the amount of work

206
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,239
that I've been doing, and people
I've been reaching out to, and so

207
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:03,828
on and so forth. But yeah.
Yeah, it's pretty much me right

208
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:04,009
now.

209
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:08,193
Bekah: That's awesome. And we're
gonna dive into Tech is Hiring a

210
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:11,464
little bit more. But before we
jump into that, I know that

211
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,313
you've been doing, you know, a
lot of different community things

212
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:17,494
and some of that's been open
source work. Do you wanna talk

213
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:21,813
about what you've been doing with
open source and how you've

214
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:22,984
been a contributor as well?

215
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:28,833
Chad: Ah, yes. Ah, yes. So, I
recently started open source

216
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:33,394
doing more open source work.
Funny enough, I started with

217
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:37,653
the- with the open source
project that I had started with,

218
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:42,874
which is Open Sauced by
Brian Douglas — at Bdougie

219
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:49,024
on- on Twitter. And he,
honestly, he approached me to ask

220
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:53,793
me to- to- to contribute
to his project. And I did.

221
00:12:53,823 --> 00:13:01,234
But I didn't stay initially,
mostly because of just all other

222
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:06,798
stuff that I kinda had going
on at the time. But he, again,

223
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:12,678
approached me later- he, again,
approached me later that year —

224
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:16,369
really late in the year —
mostly because of Tech is Hiring.

225
00:13:16,668 --> 00:13:19,700
And then he, you know, he wants
to brought -- wanted me to- to

226
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,178
come on -- to-to-to

226
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:26,328
contribute more- more
again, and that's what I've been

227
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:31,249
kinda doing for the last
couple of months. And, you know,

228
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:36,918
his- his project is pretty much
about kind of having -- it- it

229
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:40,668
being a platform of- of people
you know, transitioning into

230
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:45,558
contributing for open source.
It's in a bit of, I don't

231
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:51,739
wanna call it limbo, but if the
kind of scope is evolving at this

232
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:55,548
point. So, you know, we're-
we're all kind of trying to

233
00:13:55,548 --> 00:14:03,318
figure the OT, recently left
GitHub to- to work on- on open

234
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:09,129
source full time. And so, you
know, as he does that, and he's

235
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:13,359
putting a lot more like of his
full, you know, effort into it,

236
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:17,739
he's been- he's been kinda
expanding on that. And I've really

237
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:21,038
been helping here and there.
So like, for instance, one of the

238
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:24,369
things that I did — I'm pretty
kind of happy about this — is

239
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:27,698
that the- the- the onboarding
experience for open source was-

240
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:33,229
was a little bit disjointed and,
you know, he had managed to- to-

241
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:37,249
to get some designs, and to
just kinda change the

242
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:40,969
onboarding experience. And that
was like one of the first major

243
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:47,688
things that had helped him with,
when I started contrib- contributing

244
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:52,609
more often. And, you know, been
doing it for -- I've been working

245
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,599
on the project ever since. It --
there's two projects. There's

246
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:01,009
Open Sauced the- the- the app --
the- the- the regular app. And

247
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:05,089
then you have Hot Open Sauced,
which is like a-a-a-another --

248
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:10,399
not a child app, but just that
a-app alongside of it. I

249
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:12,889
haven't been working with Hot
Open Sauced, but yeah, that's

250
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:18,379
pretty much what I've been doing.
And, you know, you interact with

251
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:23,149
the community. You know, you get
to talk to -- you- you- you talk to

252
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:27,288
people here and there, like --
so, it's kinda interesting because

253
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:31,609
he has a- he has a Discord, which
I- I interact with a- a few times,

254
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:34,849
but to be honest, a lot of the
interactions kinda come- come

255
00:15:34,849 --> 00:15:38,749
through his stream. I feel
like a lot of people just kinda

256
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:41,658
come there. And then there's also
times where he'll have like a

257
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:45,769
call on his Discord. And, you
know, that's where you- you have

258
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:48,408
some really interesting
conversations, you know, about

259
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:51,619
the project and about kinda how
it's evolving. But just generally

260
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:55,339
about software engineering. I
think that's like in terms of-

261
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,369
of -- in terms of open source,
that's the thing that I kinda

262
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:03,000
want to -- I- I- I really think
is the most important is, you're

263
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,349
kind of

263
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:07,219
access to information that you
wouldn't regularly have, or not

264
00:16:07,219 --> 00:16:10,788
even necessarily access. Because
if you've heard these terms,

265
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:14,778
you've heard a lot of the
technologies and stuff, you

266
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:17,629
prob- you can Google it. Or,
you know, they're- they're that

267
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:22,308
open. But, like, the likelihood
of you coming across that as

268
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:25,578
somebody who's just not in the
know, you know, is very

269
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:28,759
difficult. And I think that's,
like, the- the key thing that-

270
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:33,484
that open source has been
helping me with is just coming

271
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:38,104
across these technologies, and
these people and, you know, just

272
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:41,524
getting to know them, you know?
Even if it's still more of a

273
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,124
passive la- not passive. But as
a pe- I don't know the person

274
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:47,313
directly, or I don't know -- I
haven't interacted with the

275
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:52,413
technology, but just having them
as like in your Rolodex of things

276
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:55,293
that you could leverage, you
know, is extraordinarily important.

277
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:59,433
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. I love
that. And I love Brian Douglas

278
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:02,764
too. He's pretty awesome. I --
actually, he's gonna be doing

279
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:07,263
a lunch and learn at Virtual
Coffee, which is super

280
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:11,253
exciting. We're gonna talk about
open source, and Open Sauced, and

281
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:15,963
Hacktoberfest. So that'll be coming
up in September. I'm really glad

282
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:21,588
to have him getting us in
the- in the mind frame of

283
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:26,298
prepping to do some open source
contribution. Because that's -- I --

284
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:29,719
the beginning of -- kind of of
the Virtual Coffee origin story

285
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:33,558
maybe. It's not the first
thing that we did, but it

286
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:38,148
was the first time I felt like
Virtual Coffee was gonna be an

287
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:42,888
organization that outlasts the
pandemic. I thought for a

288
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:45,989
long time that it was like, "Hey,
we're gonna get together." And

289
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:49,949
everybody's feeling isolated. And
then we did Hacktoberfest, our

290
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:53,909
first Hacktoberfest initiative.
And everybody was just so excited

291
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:57,989
about it and contributing. And we
had maintainers, and contributors,

292
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:02,314
and lots of mentorship, and
support, and it was, you know,

293
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:02,614
it was fun,

293
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:07,233
but really gratifying to see
people contributing and learning

294
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:10,023
and growing through that
experience. And, you know, it can

295
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:13,173
be- it can be scary to get
involved and do your first

296
00:18:13,173 --> 00:18:16,923
contribution. Even if you've
been in tech, we had a number of

297
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:19,324
people who have been in tech for
a while, and have never done an

298
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:22,624
open source contribution. So, you
know, what advice do you have for

299
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:26,344
folks who are m-maybe a little bit
nervous about entering that open

300
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:27,394
source experience?

301
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:32,808
Chad: That's a- that's a
really interesting question.

302
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:41,568
Hmm. What advice would I give? So,
I would say, find the community,

303
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:48,304
you know? Like, the -- so, the-
the- the open source projects

304
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:54,094
that I would definitely look-
look to, are open source

305
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:58,953
projects that are very much not
just about the- the- the

306
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:03,483
contributions, but, you know, like
the- the -- whatever you kind of

307
00:19:03,513 --> 00:19:07,294
deliver, whatever you merge, you
know? But significantly more

308
00:19:07,294 --> 00:19:12,798
about the community of people.
And just kind of the culture

309
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,909
around the- the- the open source
project. Like -- that's really

310
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:21,469
important, you know? Like, there
are a lot of -- there, you know,

311
00:19:21,469 --> 00:19:27,048
people give the advice of- of,
you know, contribute to, like you-

312
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:30,378
you -- their tools that you use all
the time like React, and so on

313
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:34,503
and so forth, you know? You want
to contribute to those. And, you

314
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:37,263
know, some of them are hit and
miss, but a lot of the times

315
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:44,493
they're so big that they -- they're
really hard to get into, you

316
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:48,753
know? Like, I- I wanted to -- I, you
know, I heard the- the whole thing.

317
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:51,094
It's like, "You should- you should
contribute to open source. It's

318
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:54,394
great." And so, I was just like, "Okay,
I'll contribute to open source,"

319
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,824
you know? "Which- which product then
I'm going to try?" "You wanna try

320
00:19:56,824 --> 00:20:00,213
to contribute to React. There's a
bunch of good first issues there."

321
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:03,000
And I was just like, "What?" [Chad
and Bekah laugh] You know what I

322
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,804
mean? Like, I couldn't

322
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,013
understand anything that they
were asking. And this was like a

323
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:11,614
couple of years back. And I, you
know, I tried it a few times and

324
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:14,703
I was just like, "I'm gonna go do
something else," you know what I

325
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:17,493
mean? So it's like really
important to kinda have that

326
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:21,663
community, like have- have those
people being very welcoming, you

327
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:26,068
know? Having the Discord. Like, a
lot of the- the secondary stuff to

328
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:31,259
the- to the- to the actual
working code and tools is- is

329
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:35,638
really important. The second
thing, and I'm- I'm really happy,

330
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:40,709
I remember this. But the second thing
is that you don't necessarily

331
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:44,673
have to contribute code, you
know? It's not just about code.

332
00:20:44,673 --> 00:20:48,183
There's a lot of other things
that you can contribute, and that

333
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:51,993
would be a contra- contribution to
open source. Like, contributing

334
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:59,824
documentation, you know? Like, I
know Brian have -- for- for open

335
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:04,683
source, he has a triage team for-
for triaging issues. I believe

336
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:13,384
that's like ... you know, find you
-- taking -- I'm sorry if I'm -- I-

337
00:21:13,384 --> 00:21:17,223
I- I hope I'm getting this right.
But, like, you- you take it -- when-

338
00:21:17,223 --> 00:21:20,523
when there's issues, you know, you
kinda scope them out so that

339
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:24,153
there's something that somebody
can easily take on. And I believe

340
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:29,763
he got that idea from the Node --
from Node. Which Node's, from my

341
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:33,300
understanding -- no, in fact, for
the longest time, I really wanted

00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:33,693
to join the

342
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:38,433
open source community for Node
because they seemed so welcoming,

343
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:43,233
you know? They seemed to have all
of this kind of infrastructure in

344
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:48,328
place for a new person to come in
and really be able to

345
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:52,618
contribute, you know? Like, I
don't remember exactly everything

346
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:55,048
that they have now, but like, they
have, you know, they have stuff

347
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:58,019
on YouTube, they have them week --
they have weekly meetings on

348
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:02,638
YouTube, you know? Like, they have,
like, this whole community around

349
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:07,499
joining them. And so -- and -- I'll try
not to- to go into the community thing

350
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:11,929
again, but like, there are a lot
of things that you can do to contribute,

351
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:15,048
you know? Like, you can contribute
documentation, like for- for- for

352
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:18,618
the Node project. Like, I believe
you can do something like just

353
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:21,288
kinda help managing the
meetings that they have because

354
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:25,878
they regularly have meetings. But
there are a lot of outside things,

355
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:30,499
outside of like literally writing
the code that needs to go into

356
00:22:30,503 --> 00:22:35,209
the project that can go- that can
go in there. And people have

357
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:40,413
literally gotten opportunities from
contributing to open source-

358
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:44,854
open source projects in these
auxiliary ways, you know? And so,

359
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:47,778
I would -- so the thing that I
would definitely stress is

360
00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:50,989
community, you know? Like,
community is extraordinarily

361
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:55,219
important, you know? Having
people to have your back, you

362
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:58,578
know, when you're contributing is
really important. To be quite

363
00:22:58,584 --> 00:23:02,628
honest, I would say that it's
much more important to- to- to

364
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:05,358
build and maintain those
relationships than it is to

365
00:23:05,358 --> 00:23:09,064
contribute the code. In my opinion.
But it's much more important

366
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:11,884
to have those relationships. In
fact, I would say that's the most

367
00:23:11,884 --> 00:23:16,804
important thing about open source.
And that it's not just about

368
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:21,153
contributing code. You don't need
to contribute code. It's- it's

369
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:25,173
about you can contribute in- in
your own way. Just reach out. And

370
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:28,953
there might be things that- that,
you know, that the- the- the

371
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,854
maintainer needs. And, you know,
you may be able to help- help

372
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:36,903
there. But just -- I guess, to kind
of sum up at the very least the

373
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:39,933
last part is just be very open
minded on how you- how you'd like

374
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:42,903
to contribute to the community,
you know? Like, you don't

375
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:45,153
necessarily have to contribute
something that, you know, gets

376
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:49,209
merged into a pull request. Well, yeah.
But just be very open minded on

377
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:52,749
how you'd contribute to the community
-- to- to- to that community

378
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:57,398
and focus on community, you know?
Even if it's a small community,

379
00:23:57,398 --> 00:24:01,598
just focus on the relationships
that you're building with- with

380
00:24:01,598 --> 00:24:04,689
these people. It's not just
about, you know, you write

381
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:08,108
something and then merge
requests and then you, you know,

382
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:11,378
you go off somewhere, you know?
It's about building those

383
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:12,500
relationships, you know?

384
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:12,700
Bekah: Yeah.

385
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,269
Chad: That's- that's what I
would say. Sorry

384
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:15,509
for cutting you out.

385
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:18,903
Bekah: No, no, no. I love that. I
love focusing -- especially for

386
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:22,084
first time contributors on that
interaction on the community

387
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:26,433
building of things, because
getting into open source can be

388
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:30,574
really nerve-wracking or seem
really hard to do, but you're

389
00:24:30,574 --> 00:24:33,544
right. If you find that right
community, it makes it a lot

390
00:24:33,548 --> 00:24:36,394
easier for you and you are
building those relationships.

391
00:24:36,723 --> 00:24:41,588
And, you know, if we look at even
some of the larger open source

392
00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:45,759
projects, sometimes- sometimes
there's a need for smaller

393
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,929
contributions or sometimes their
first time contributor issues are

394
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:52,929
exactly like what you were
talking about. Like, "I have no

395
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:56,499
idea what you're talking about.
This is not for me." And then

396
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:59,753
that's okay, you know? There are
other opportunities out there.

397
00:24:59,993 --> 00:25:02,693
And this is one of my pet peeves
where people are like, this is

398
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:05,513
not in the spirit of Hacktoberfest.
And they wanna say like,

399
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:09,713
"Oh, you can't make a contribution
that looks like this or that. Just

400
00:25:09,713 --> 00:25:15,338
changes one thing." And I- I
think that maybe that's how you

401
00:25:15,338 --> 00:25:19,568
feel about your project, but that
doesn't necessarily apply to

402
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:22,568
other people's projects. There
are a lot of projects out there

403
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:26,709
that are community run, that are
people who are trying to

404
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:30,269
collaborate, and work together, and
support other people. So there

405
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:34,118
are lots of different projects.
There's different approaches to

406
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:38,318
open source contribution. And
finding that community that's

407
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:41,138
going to support you is going to
help you to make that

408
00:25:41,548 --> 00:25:41,949
contribution.

409
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:46,078
Chad: Absolutely. Absolutely. I
agree. And I'd like to touch on a

410
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:50,068
little bit about, you know, there
are a lot of kind of community

411
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:56,209
run projects. I've been there. So,
[chuckles] this is- this is kind of funny.

412
00:25:56,269 --> 00:26:00,588
I went through -- just looking
up a lot of interview prep stuff.

413
00:26:00,594 --> 00:26:04,398
Cuz to be quite honest, I did a
lot of that within the last -- not

414
00:26:04,403 --> 00:26:08,148
within the last couple of months,
but years prior, I was doing

415
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:14,374
a lot of interview prep. And there
are so many kind of, you know,

416
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:18,334
thing -- I don't know if they're
necessarily open source projects,

417
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:21,723
but they're projects that, you
know, have a GitHub that's, you know,

418
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:25,894
open to the world. And, you know,
like, as far as I know, it's not

419
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:30,003
a paid product, you know? I think
it's -- yeah. I don't think it's

420
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:33,334
a paid product. Like, for
instance, there's- there's the

421
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:36,483
algorithms, which is something
that I just recently found out

422
00:26:36,753 --> 00:26:41,568
about, which is literally a
project of a bunch of kinda data

423
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:46,788
structures and algorithms that
you would see in interviews.

424
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:50,689
And it's like a huge kinda log
of them in different languages.

425
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:54,169
You know what I mean? And as far
as I know, that's not a paid

426
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:57,108
product. It's just out there, you
know? And like, I was bookmarking

427
00:26:57,108 --> 00:27:00,019
a bunch of these things. But
there's that- there's that. Like,

428
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:04,489
there's the- the- the -- what you
call it? The tech interview

429
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:09,739
handbook, which kind of gives you
like a real -- you know, it's a

430
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:13,429
great breakdown of how
interviewing is, how you study,

431
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:16,939
you know? What you -- what people
are- are looking. Funny enough.

432
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:21,499
The thing that I -- that draw me
to that was, you know, what, you

433
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:25,159
know, there -- it described like
how people are- are kind of

434
00:27:25,163 --> 00:27:28,788
looking- looking at you, at,
like, big tech interview -- the

435
00:27:28,788 --> 00:27:31,368
point I'm making is all of those
things, when you look at them on

436
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:35,300
GitHub, they're really just like
marked on files, you know? I

437
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:35,778
think they are. But

437
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:38,449
they're- they're not like
anything crazy, you know? You're

438
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:42,979
not like using Redux to- to
display all of this information,

439
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:47,884
you know what I mean? But those
projects like that have hundreds of

440
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:51,903
contributors. And you know, like,
you can contribute to that

441
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:55,233
project. Say- say for instance,
you've done a massive amount of

442
00:27:55,233 --> 00:27:58,384
interviewing — to- to kind of stay
in context — the ma- massive

443
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:02,223
amount of interviewing and you
feel like there's an issue here.

444
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:06,084
Issue with some of the
information here. You could most

445
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,953
definitely reach out or- or- or
apply a change. And I- I mean, even

446
00:28:09,953 --> 00:28:11,993
then, it's like, all of this is
kinda talking about

447
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:15,624
information, right? So, you know,
say there's like typos or it's

448
00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:19,163
just not as clear, you can
definitely just, you know, clear

449
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:24,604
up that information or reach out to
whoever. And- and like, that isn't

450
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:28,834
necessarily code in the se- in- in
the sense that most people think

451
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:31,804
of open source projects. When
people think of open s- or

452
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:35,523
contributing to open source
projects, they think about adding

453
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:42,213
a feature or refactoring. Very
much like code, you know? Very

454
00:28:42,213 --> 00:28:47,493
much like that very particular
use case. When there's -- like I

455
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:52,114
said, there's a whole breadth of
things that you can- you can- you

456
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:56,284
can do. And I mean, we're- we're
-- even- even this conversation,

457
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:59,919
we're kinda talking about the --
at least, the- the way I'm kind of

458
00:28:59,923 --> 00:29:03,038
thinking about it is like, if
you're doing open source, you're

459
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:06,308
literally on GitHub, you
literally go to the project, and

460
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:09,489
then it's just like, however,
right? But, you know, if you're --

461
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,209
if the- the open source project
has a community, you know, you

462
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:17,378
may not necessarily even be on
GitHub, you know? Like, you could

463
00:29:17,384 --> 00:29:20,528
be- you could be a part of their
Discord, and you could be, like,

464
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:23,558
moderating their Discord, and
something like that, you know?

465
00:29:23,648 --> 00:29:26,648
Like, that's still contr-
contributing, you know what I

466
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:32,239
mean? So, like, I just -- I guess
I just wanted to- to- to, again,

467
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:36,558
reemphasize that there's a lot of
things that you can do to

468
00:29:36,564 --> 00:29:40,909
contribute to community, you
know? Like it's, again, it's not

469
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:44,500
just writing co- I wanna say
JavaScripts of that [Bekah

00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:44,739
giggles]. It's not

470
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:47,778
just writing JavaScript, you know
what I mean? It's just not

471
00:29:47,808 --> 00:29:51,949
writing code. Like, there's a lot
of ways you can- you can

472
00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:56,584
contribute and it's just keeping that
open mind of the- the- the, you know,

473
00:29:56,733 --> 00:30:00,000
the- the needs of the- the- the
maintainer.

474
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,300
Bekah: Yeah.

474
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,294
Chad: That's pretty much it.

475
00:30:01,443 --> 00:30:05,163
Dan: Yeah, I love that. You know,
and- and Virtual Coffee [chuckles] for

476
00:30:05,163 --> 00:30:08,344
example, right? And we have lots
of volunteers that are -- that help

477
00:30:08,344 --> 00:30:11,733
our community. But also like
our- our site is open source. And,

478
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:14,884
I don't know, like 80% of the
files are just content, you know?

479
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:19,114
I mean, they're just -- and it -- I
suppose it's code technically or

480
00:30:19,114 --> 00:30:21,663
something [chuckles], you know? But
it's -- like, the- the valuable parts of

481
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:25,683
it are the- are the words, right?
Are the content, you know? And ...

482
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:28,953
I- I mean, I love that advice. I
think it's great and very

483
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,933
important to keep in mind. And
also, it's like -- sometimes,

484
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:33,963
especially when you get into docs
and stuff like that is, sometimes

485
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:38,074
really hard for maintainers to
keep up to date or to make, you

486
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:41,824
know, like to catch all the
edge cases and things like that.

487
00:30:41,854 --> 00:30:45,094
Ayu from Virtual Coffee is
really good at this shit. You

488
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:48,243
know, how many times have you
done, like some install -- followed

489
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:50,884
the README, right? Done some
install thing, and it didn't work.

490
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:53,733
And you had to like Google around
and try a couple different things

491
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:56,554
to get something to work, right?
And then, what I do most of the

492
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,983
time is just, "Okay, cool. I got it
working. I'll just move on," [chuckles]

493
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:01,923
you know? But how val- how much,
like, it would be a very easy and

494
00:31:01,923 --> 00:31:06,993
valuable contribution to that-
that project to just go back and add

495
00:31:07,054 --> 00:31:09,574
like a- a pull request that just
adds a little note in the README

496
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:12,453
that says, "Hey, if you run into
this error, try this fix," you

497
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:16,413
know what I mean? And I
think that's the kind of thing

498
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:19,983
that a lot of people maybe don't
consider right away. But it --

499
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:21,000
I don't know. Can be --

500
00:31:20,808 --> 00:31:23,058
Bekah: Kinda like that error that
I have running the Virtual Coffee

501
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:25,098
site that I still haven't
[chuckles] done anything about?

502
00:31:25,413 --> 00:31:27,064
Dan: Right. Well, that's a whole
different ... yeah, issue -- situation.

503
00:31:27,378 --> 00:31:28,939
Bekah: No, that's a Netlify CLI
issue actually.

504
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:32,044
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. But- but- but it
is the same thing. I mean, like

505
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:35,433
it's- it's the same thing. Like,
okay. Like, maybe that is something we

506
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:38,013
need to add. Cuz other people --
most people don't have the Netlify

507
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:42,423
CLI installed, like, to start and
-- but you already did. And so

508
00:31:42,423 --> 00:31:46,354
there's something going on and
maybe there's some note we need

509
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:49,564
to add or some parameter to add
to the install steps, you know? I

510
00:31:49,564 --> 00:31:51,000
don't know. I don't know what it
is, but like, even-

511
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,300
Bekah: Yeah [chuckles].

512
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:51,723
Dan: -just bringing

511
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:54,273
it up in issue, like, even
honestly, writing an issue is

512
00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:55,000
contributing to an open source.

513
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:55,800
Bekah: Yes.

514
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,084
Dan: Like, not fixing it, not-
not

513
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:02,929
knowing the solution, but just
like logging a problem. It can be

514
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:06,108
a very valuable contribution to 
[chuckles] an open source project

515
00:32:06,108 --> 00:32:09,138
because, most likely the maintainer
doesn't know about it, you know?

516
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:13,759
Our maintainers don't know about
it. Like the -- or they do and

517
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:20,209
they forgot or [chuckles], you
know, anything. And I- I- I --

518
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:22,548
yeah, I don't know. I- I think
everything you said is- is right.

519
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:26,689
And I- I think it's great. I
love that also. I just talk a

520
00:32:26,689 --> 00:32:30,078
little bit more. I love that idea
about helping- helping

521
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:33,618
maintainers in areas outside of
GitHub even, and how valuable

522
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,398
that can be. I think- I think
that's another thing that people

523
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:40,128
don't maybe always think about.
But asking maintainers if they

524
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:44,388
need help outside of writing
code, it can be nice and it

525
00:32:44,388 --> 00:32:47,179
can be nice- nice to, like, have
somebody to reach out- reach out

526
00:32:47,183 --> 00:32:50,269
[chuckles] to you too, you know, sometimes.
Say, "Hey, do you need any help

527
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:52,548
with this?" Even if- even if
they say no, it's- it's like a

528
00:32:52,548 --> 00:32:54,798
nice ... I don't know. Nice
gesture.

529
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,200 
Chad: Yeah --

529
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:55,894
Bekah: Yeah, I --

530
00:32:56,443 --> 00:32:56,923
Chad: Oh, go ahead, go ahead, go
ahead.

531
00:32:57,034 --> 00:33:00,183
Bekah: Sorry. I- I gave a talk
on ... I think it was called do

532
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:03,604
you need community? And it was
from the perspective of if

533
00:33:03,604 --> 00:33:07,354
you're maybe getting into code,
or if you are in tech and you

534
00:33:07,354 --> 00:33:10,864
don't have a community, what- what
would be the reasons and the

535
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:14,223
benefits. And part of that, I
talked about getting involved in

536
00:33:14,223 --> 00:33:17,703
organizations. And sometimes
people say like, "Hey, do you need

537
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:20,374
any help?" And there's so much
overwhelmed sometimes as a

538
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:22,683
maintainer that it's like, "Yeah,
but I don't even know where to

539
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:26,673
start," right? And so being more
specific like, "Hey, do you need

540
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:29,253
any help? I'm really good at
building chat bots. And I think

541
00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:32,104
this could be really beneficial."
Like, giving that specific thing

542
00:33:32,104 --> 00:33:37,298
or, "Hey, I like to post on social
media. Can I write some tweets

543
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:41,288
for you?" And you know, you're not
getting a green box for that. And

544
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:45,098
I know that it can be really hard
to feel like, "Oh, there -- I

545
00:33:45,098 --> 00:33:47,739
haven't accomplished anything,"
but you've supported a community

546
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:51,608
of people that- that is
supporting other people. So, and

547
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:54,999
I- I think the -- one of the things
I like too about Virtual Coffee,

548
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:58,838
our members page just keeps
evolving into something better

549
00:33:58,838 --> 00:34:02,499
and better because we have our
members who have to create a pull

550
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:07,209
request to get their profile on
our mem- members page. But then

551
00:34:07,568 --> 00:34:12,759
last year, the issue was you can
add your social links. And

552
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,478
we've updated it with all of our
active volunteers. So, you know,

553
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:20,943
like finding ways to also
support the people who are

554
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:24,094
supporting your project in other
ways is incredibly important as

555
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:24,483
well.

556
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:29,938
Chad: I agree. I agree. And,
I also want to kind of reiterate

557
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:34,588
that, like, you know, you- you --
for- for the people who are

558
00:34:34,588 --> 00:34:38,429
actually contributing code, they --
a lot of those people do that to

559
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:39,700
improve their skills, right?

560
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:39,900
Bekah: Mm.

561
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,909
Chad: To come across problems
that they

560
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:44,608
generally wouldn't come across or
be more difficult for them to

561
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:51,873
come across o-on their own, right?
But I think the most important

562
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:57,934
part of open source as a
contributor is to -- is that

563
00:34:57,934 --> 00:35:01,744
interaction. The interaction with
people, you know what I mean? And

564
00:35:01,748 --> 00:35:05,434
so definitely being -- having
something where it's like, okay,

565
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:08,373
you reach out to the maintainers.
It's like, "Hey, I can do this,"

566
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:11,344
you know? Like you were saying,
you know? "I can- I can do tweets,"

567
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:16,099
and so on and so forth. Like, that
interaction is so valuable. And

568
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:20,958
the con- that consistency of
interaction is so valuable. Like,

569
00:35:21,168 --> 00:35:23,958
you'd be surprised, you'd be-
you'd be maintaining a project,

570
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:26,539
and there's just somebody who,
you know, you- you know them- you

571
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:30,893
know them casually and then they
turn out to be -- well, 50% of the

572
00:35:30,893 --> 00:35:35,333
time, they turn on to be, you
know, your- your next employer

573
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,123
because they're now op- offering
you an opportunity. I- I was

574
00:35:38,123 --> 00:35:41,184
watching a video recently, you
know, I'm just going to be -- I was

575
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:45,300
watching a video from Open Sauced
recently, where -- I don't

00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,284
remember who he

576
00:35:46,284 --> 00:35:51,923
was or who Brian was talking to,
but he was talking about how

577
00:35:51,923 --> 00:35:56,603
we had an open source project and
like, it became more and more of a-

578
00:35:57,844 --> 00:36:01,414
of a -- I don't remember exactly
the- the- the circumstances. But

579
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:05,673
he -- and he started hiring a lot
of people because he had somebody

580
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:08,224
who was -- he had started hiring --
not a lot of people. He started

581
00:36:08,224 --> 00:36:12,603
hiring from his contributors
because his contributors were

582
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:15,903
very consistent, they were
excellent, you know, in what the --

583
00:36:15,903 --> 00:36:18,903
in their contributions. And he
just -- he was just like, "Hey, you

584
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:21,153
want to, you want a full time
job?" And they were like, "Yeah,

585
00:36:21,153 --> 00:36:26,599
sure." And that's how they found
their next opportunitiy, you know?

586
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:32,119
And so, it's really about those
relationships, you know? As a

587
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:35,268
contributor. As a- as a
maintainer, you know, like, that's

588
00:36:35,268 --> 00:36:38,329
a -- I don't want to talk about
that too much cuz that's just

589
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:41,659
not -- I don't have the experience
there. But as a contributor, it's

590
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:45,259
about building those
relationships. And, like, it's just

591
00:36:45,259 --> 00:36:49,809
a different avenue of- of
building those relationships with

592
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:53,228
people. And then, you know,
showing that, you know, like -- I

593
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:56,588
guess going back to- to coding,
showing that, you know, you can

594
00:36:56,588 --> 00:37:00,039
code — that's like one of the big
issues, the big problems with-

595
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:03,878
with junior developers trying to
get positions — is that ... effectively

596
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:06,849
they have to prove that they-
they know how to code and they

597
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,998
can just be like, "Hey, look at my
contribution to this open source

598
00:37:09,998 --> 00:37:13,119
project that got, you know, that
got merged and is being used in

599
00:37:13,123 --> 00:37:16,864
the project right now and has my name
on it," you know? "I can code," [laughs] you

600
00:37:16,864 --> 00:37:23,103
know what I mean? Like, so -- like,
it's just, yeah. It's just -- it's

601
00:37:23,103 --> 00:37:25,143
about building those
relationships. Those

602
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:30,634
relationships will- will
definitely take you far. A-at least

603
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:33,753
in my- in my opinion, that's like
one of the biggest things for-

604
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:33,903
for- for --

605
00:37:34,324 --> 00:37:37,083
Dan: Yeah. A-and- and not just proving
you can code, but proving that you have

606
00:37:37,143 --> 00:37:40,443
drive, and can operate on your own,
and things like that as well.

607
00:37:41,313 --> 00:37:45,273
A-and you're interested in it and,
you know, I- I- I think- I think that

608
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:51,739
sort of ... I don't know. A- a- a
full [chuckles], you know, I don't wanna say

609
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:54,949
like, all- all the green squares are
green, but like, you know- you

610
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:57,228
know, a full, like, GitHub profile
where you have a lot of

611
00:37:57,228 --> 00:38:01,309
contributions to some things
can go a really long way. To

612
00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:05,088
showing that, y-you know, even if
you're not, like, write -- like you

613
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:08,809
said, like, rewriting the React
code base, you know? [Laughs] Like, it-

614
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:11,119
it doesn't have to be like that,
obviously, e-e-especially when you're

615
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,778
starting out. But just like
connecting with people and- and- and

616
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:19,009
contributing in -- I don't know. I-
I, yeah. I agree. It's can be a

617
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:21,259
very valuable tool; open
source contributions.

618
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:26,764
Bekah: I know a woman who really
wanted to work with a pretty

619
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:31,293
notable tech organization, but
their interview process was

620
00:38:31,293 --> 00:38:35,884
notoriously hard. And she knew she
would not be able to pass the

621
00:38:35,884 --> 00:38:40,853
interview process. And, you know,
didn't have time to devote hours

622
00:38:41,103 --> 00:38:44,733
and months of her life to studying
for it. And so, she started

623
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:49,114
contributing to their open source
project. And sure enough, she got

624
00:38:49,114 --> 00:38:52,143
hired without having to go
through that interview process

625
00:38:52,143 --> 00:38:54,994
because she was familiar with the
code base, they knew that her

626
00:38:54,994 --> 00:38:59,074
work was good, and that she could-
could be a part of the team

627
00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:01,623
because of that community
collaboration that she already

628
00:39:01,623 --> 00:39:05,193
had. So, I mean, not everybody's
gonna let you navigate

629
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:08,344
around the interview process. But
it was really, really great

630
00:39:08,344 --> 00:39:12,494
strategy for, you know, not only
learning more it yourself, but like

631
00:39:12,494 --> 00:39:16,333
you're saying, finding new
avenues to job opportunities.

632
00:39:17,744 --> 00:39:21,164
Chad: Agreed. Agreed. I actually
was, I don't necessarily have a

633
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:25,034
direct story, but I've definitely
heard of other people who've had

634
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:29,623
similar experiences, who -- they-
they contributed to- to- to large

635
00:39:29,623 --> 00:39:34,184
open source projects for pretty
well-known companies, and, you

636
00:39:34,184 --> 00:39:37,818
know, no interview processes like,
"We- we see that you co- we see

637
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:40,909
that you can code. We, you know,
we want you to work on this

638
00:39:40,909 --> 00:39:44,418
thing," you know? So they just
brought them on board, you know?

639
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:47,688
It wasn't that -- it wasn't a big,
crazy thing, you know? They

640
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:51,528
didn't have to study for- for-
for months like you said, you

641
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:56,809
know? Definitely like -- and from
my understanding, that is- that

642
00:39:56,809 --> 00:40:03,289
is not uncommon, you know? Like,
it's not an uncommon circumstance

643
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:07,818
at all, you know? So, definitely -- I
definitely, again, you know, it's

644
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:11,719
about those relationships. It's
about, you know, it's about

645
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,259
building those relationships
with- with- with those- with

646
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:19,369
those people, you know? And even
with other contributors as well,

647
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:23,778
you know? Like, how- how many
people have- have kind of come-

648
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:26,688
come to Virtual Coffee and have
become friends with each other

649
00:40:27,173 --> 00:40:31,509
because of kind of their- their-
their meeting at Virtual Coffee

650
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:34,989
or doing work with vir- Virtual
Coffee, you know what I mean? So

651
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:38,739
it's definitely about building
those relationships. Again, in my

652
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:39,068
opinion.

653
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:41,929
Bekah: Yeah. Well, and I think too,
one of the great things about

654
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:44,599
contributing to open source is
also learning how to take

655
00:40:44,603 --> 00:40:48,708
feedback. Because oftentimes, you
know, you've got a PR and it's

656
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:51,259
not going to be perfect. So
you'll be getting some feedback.

657
00:40:51,528 --> 00:40:54,289
Do you have any experience with
that? And, you know, like, has

658
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:57,108
that helped you develop as a
developer [laughs]?

659
00:40:58,233 --> 00:41:01,353
Chad: It has definitely not
helped me develop as a developer

660
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:04,000
because that'd -- no, I'm just
[Chad and Bekah laugh]. Yeah,

661
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,103
I've gotten -- I've

661
00:41:05,103 --> 00:41:09,543
definitely gotten feedback.
Like, one of the kinda key

662
00:41:09,543 --> 00:41:12,873
things about just being
coachable, you know? And again,

663
00:41:12,963 --> 00:41:18,934
like, because it's a learning
experience, you know? Like, I

664
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:22,804
don't wanna say -- well, because
it's a learning experience, you

665
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:25,000
should really be happy for
feedback, you know?

666
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,300
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

667
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,673
Chad: Like, you

666
00:41:26,673 --> 00:41:28,923
don't want somebody to be giving
you feedback where they're like,

667
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:29,700
"[Mimicking angry tone] Argh,
argh, argh," you know? and

00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,134
they're just kinda yelling down.
Like, nobody

668
00:41:32,134 --> 00:41:35,403
wants that, you know what I mean?
But if it's like, "Hey, I would

669
00:41:35,403 --> 00:41:39,963
structure it this way." Like, that's
like the key thing about, you

670
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:44,434
know, contributions, right? Like, ab-
about open source, right? Like, I

671
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:47,164
don't wanna say it's judgment
free again, you know, it depends

672
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:52,954
on who's giving you the feedback,
but it's- it's- it's somewhat

673
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:56,523
non-committal in that sense -- in a
sense, you know? Like, you don't

674
00:41:56,554 --> 00:42:00,333
have to give your contribution.
You absolutely don't have to.

675
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:04,384
It's not life or death. You know
what I mean? So, a lot of the

676
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:09,423
times, like, you can give your --
you can give a contribution and

677
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:13,893
they give you feedback. And that
feedback is just gold. You know

678
00:42:13,893 --> 00:42:16,833
what I mean? It's just like,
there's stuff that they talk

679
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:20,914
about, that they -- that you didn't
know, or even necessarily they

680
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:24,934
give you feedback and you push
back on the feedback and say,

681
00:42:24,934 --> 00:42:28,173
"Hey, this is my -- this is the
reason why --," like, all of that-

682
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:31,998
that interaction is extremely
important. That's what you're

683
00:42:31,998 --> 00:42:37,608
gonna be doing on the job, you
know? Like, code review is going

684
00:42:37,608 --> 00:42:41,298
to happen [laughs]. It, like, well, I
don't wanna say it's going to happen.

685
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:44,748
There are some companies --
anyways. But, like, the likelihood

686
00:42:44,748 --> 00:42:49,998
of that is so high. Like, that is
just an interaction that you have

687
00:42:49,998 --> 00:42:54,619
to go through, you know? And not
only that, like, the amount of

688
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:58,489
information that you can get from
somebody saying, you know, "I

689
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:00,800
don't think is -- this is the
best way of doing it. I think

690
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,219
this is -- a- a

690
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:08,179
better way is this," is like,
especially when it's -- it can

691
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:12,498
potentially be difficult or just
hard to- to- to get

692
00:43:12,498 --> 00:43:15,559
information and to be able to
leverage it immediately. Like,

693
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:18,978
you know, you can go to a
tutorial and you can learn a

694
00:43:18,978 --> 00:43:22,458
bunch of things, but a lot of the
times, if it doesn't apply to

695
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:26,179
whatever you're doing right now,
you know, it doesn't stick unless

696
00:43:26,184 --> 00:43:31,128
you keep doing it over and over.
But, like, getting that feedback,

697
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:34,804
you know, on something that
you're working on, and then

698
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:38,914
leveraging it, and then, you know,
like saying, "Okay, I've applied

699
00:43:38,914 --> 00:43:41,853
it," or, "I don't- I don't
necessarily agree with your

700
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:45,903
feedback." Like, that is such an
important thing. Even if you

701
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:48,634
don't agree with it, it might be
something whereas, you know,

702
00:43:48,634 --> 00:43:51,123
might be another tool in your
toolbox. You know what I mean?

703
00:43:51,123 --> 00:43:57,378
So, like, it's- it's kind -- it's still
kind of sticky because, again, you

704
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,958
know, some people are a little
bit more harsh with their

705
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:03,259
feedback or it's not even
necessarily harsh, but their

706
00:44:03,259 --> 00:44:08,539
feedback doesn't kind of mesh
with how your culturally kind of

707
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:13,878
built to accept feedback, you
know? But, like, for the most part,

708
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:17,509
like, all of that stuff can potentially
be gold to you, especially as a-

709
00:44:17,778 --> 00:44:21,528
as a new person, still learning,
you know? If, like, them telling

710
00:44:21,528 --> 00:44:24,168
you, "Hey, I don't think this is
necessarily the best way," you

711
00:44:24,168 --> 00:44:28,684
know? Like, all of that is great stuff,
you know? That stuff that you

712
00:44:28,684 --> 00:44:32,943
can- you can put- you can put
away and then, like, potentially

713
00:44:32,943 --> 00:44:36,273
work on later. Like, even if, say,
your contribution doesn't get

714
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:40,054
accepted for whatever reason, you
know? Like, that information for

715
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:44,463
you is really, really good when
you're learning, you know? And it

716
00:44:44,463 --> 00:44:48,454
really just kind of like, I would
say in terms of navigating code-

717
00:44:48,514 --> 00:44:52,773
code -- I don't wanna say -- well,
getting feedback. It really just

718
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:56,789
kinda understanding the person
and how they're giving feedback.

719
00:44:57,148 --> 00:45:01,318
And if they're giving, like,
feedback that is not particularly

720
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:04,500
great or is demeaning, you know?
Let's get up and walk away.

721
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:04,700
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

721
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:08,000
Chad: Again, you're not committed,
you know? Like, if they're going

722
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,668
to be that

722
00:45:08,668 --> 00:45:11,699
person, you know, that- that's
not somebody you want to be

723
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:16,534
associated with, you know, in any
form of kinda long term anything, you

724
00:45:16,534 --> 00:45:19,864
know? But generally, like, you
know, people are very friendly.

725
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:22,474
Like, people [chuckles] want you
to come back. Like, some people

726
00:45:22,474 --> 00:45:25,023
desperately want you to come
back, you know? It's like, you

727
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:28,503
know, "I'm working on this by myself
[chuckles]," or, "I'm working on this

728
00:45:28,503 --> 00:45:31,773
with a small group of people, you
know? More people who are working

729
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:34,773
with me, you know, the better,"
you know what I mean? So it's in

730
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:41,298
their -- it's -- they're incentivized
to- to- to kinda keep you

731
00:45:41,298 --> 00:45:45,289
coming back, you know what I
mean? That's -- and there's also

732
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:48,708
like -- and this is a part of -- kind
of the community aspect of- of open

733
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:52,759
source or a particular open
source project. Like, how to kind

734
00:45:52,759 --> 00:46:00,168
of contribute and like having a-
having a system kind of around

735
00:46:00,168 --> 00:46:04,893
contribution in the sense of, you
know, code style, you know, tools

736
00:46:04,893 --> 00:46:08,134
that you- you- you are using and
stuff like that. Being very

737
00:46:08,134 --> 00:46:13,083
structured in that way, it really
kind of lets people know how to-

738
00:46:13,594 --> 00:46:17,583
how to approach the project. You
know what I mean? So that's also

739
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:21,634
a good thing to kind of look for.
It does- it doesn't necessarily- it

740
00:46:21,634 --> 00:46:24,813
doesn't necessarily address
feedback directly, you know? But

741
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:28,114
it kinda addressed what- what
your expectations of the feedback

742
00:46:28,114 --> 00:46:32,704
will- will- will be, you know?
But, yeah. Like, I -- yeah [unintelligible] --

743
00:46:32,898 --> 00:46:36,000
Dan: So, as a- as a contributor
-- like a potential contri-

744
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,648
contributor to a

744
00:46:36,648 --> 00:46:39,108
project, what- what are your
steps? Like, what do you do

745
00:46:39,108 --> 00:46:43,998
before- before you, like, file
a pull request? Like, what do you --

746
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:46,728
like, I assume you maybe read the
README. What- what else -- what other

747
00:46:46,728 --> 00:46:50,784
kinda steps do you take, like, to
make sure that you're doing what the-

748
00:46:50,784 --> 00:46:52,563
what the maintainers want you
to do, you know?

749
00:46:53,253 --> 00:46:57,184
Chad: To be fair, so, I've mostly
been working with Open Sauced. And

750
00:46:57,184 --> 00:47:01,233
they've had -- they have a very
good, you know, kind of contributors

751
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:06,603
doc, you know? And so they kind
of put the systems in place so

752
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:10,204
that you don't necessarily -- so
that you don't mess up, you know,

753
00:47:10,264 --> 00:47:13,293
in a sense, right? So there's
like a lot of kind of guardrails

754
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:17,884
and hand-holding that the- that
the system will do, you know? But,

755
00:47:18,244 --> 00:47:22,083
like -- again, you know, you can
say, for instance, there isn't

756
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:28,023
really any contri- any, like, docs
on contributing. Generally, that's

757
00:47:28,023 --> 00:47:31,173
the first place to start, you
know? Docs on contri- just

758
00:47:31,173 --> 00:47:35,313
the- the- the kinda docs on the
infrastructure, right? Like, on

759
00:47:35,494 --> 00:47:39,333
how you contribute. Just start
there, you know? Before- before

760
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:42,603
anything else. Because a- a- a
good, well-maintained open source

761
00:47:42,603 --> 00:47:46,668
project will at least have docs-
docs to- to- to tell you how to

762
00:47:46,673 --> 00:47:49,699
contribute. If they don't
necessarily have docs, you may,

763
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:53,119
you know, may reach out to the
maintainer and ask questions. You

764
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,599
may file an issue, ask questions.
By the way, if they don't have con-

765
00:47:56,869 --> 00:48:01,699
docs on contributing, that's a
really good contribution [laughs], you

766
00:48:01,704 --> 00:48:06,978
know? Like -- but it's just really --
just getting clarification, how-

767
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:09,378
however you can. Like, that
doesn't necessarily mean you

768
00:48:09,378 --> 00:48:12,978
don't -- you can't just work on
the- on the pull request

769
00:48:12,983 --> 00:48:16,849
immediately. But, you know, like,
just getting clarification on how

770
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:21,349
they kind of want the- the- the pull
request set up. Like, and like I

771
00:48:21,353 --> 00:48:24,318
said. Get that clarification
however you can either they have

772
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:29,043
docs written or you just reach out
to people di-directly, you know? You

773
00:48:29,043 --> 00:48:32,523
may even kind of go back to- to-
to previous pull requests and-

774
00:48:32,793 --> 00:48:36,543
and take a look at that. But I
would definitely say if they

775
00:48:36,543 --> 00:48:40,023
don't have docs, just reach out
to the maintainer and- and- and start

776
00:48:40,023 --> 00:48:44,043
there. I don't have the most
amount of experience here

777
00:48:44,043 --> 00:48:47,704
because, you know, like my open
source -- the project that I work

778
00:48:47,704 --> 00:48:52,414
with mostly have a lot of these
kind of things in place. But, you

779
00:48:52,414 --> 00:48:54,393
know, just getting that
clarification. Like, that's-

780
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:56,074
that's the best way I would
submit them. Just get that

781
00:48:56,074 --> 00:49:00,813
clarification first, because it
would kinda- it would kinda suck

782
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:03,423
where you do all of this work. It
may even take you like a couple

783
00:49:03,423 --> 00:49:06,123
of days. You do all of this work,
and then you make a pull request.

784
00:49:06,423 --> 00:49:10,324
And then they- they- they
deny the pull request for

785
00:49:10,324 --> 00:49:13,474
something simple that you could
have easily sorted out day one,

786
00:49:13,923 --> 00:49:17,628
you know? And, you know, nobody
wants their pull request

787
00:49:17,628 --> 00:49:20,778
rejected, you know what I mean?
So it's like, it- it's just like

788
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:23,059
at the very least you can just do
those things if you don't -- if

789
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:26,358
you're not necessarily a hundred
percent clear, you know? That's- that's --

790
00:49:27,693 --> 00:49:32,134
Bekah: Yeah. I love that. And- and I
mean, so you- you said you contribute to

791
00:49:32,134 --> 00:49:34,864
Open Sauced and they've got a
great process. So if you wanna

792
00:49:34,864 --> 00:49:37,384
get started, and you wanna know
what a good project looks like

793
00:49:37,384 --> 00:49:40,684
so you can identify other ones,
then go to Open Sauced and look at

794
00:49:40,893 --> 00:49:44,239
what they have there. Because
that's a good way to start. And I

795
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:47,599
know, you know, we've got a
pretty thorough contributing

796
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,438
guidelines doc on our Virtual
Coffee site as well. And, you

797
00:49:51,438 --> 00:49:53,568
know, sometimes there's
discussions — not everybody has

798
00:49:53,568 --> 00:49:57,139
discussions enabled — but I really
like discussions for being able

799
00:49:57,139 --> 00:50:00,378
to have community members ask
questions about things and to

800
00:50:00,384 --> 00:50:03,978
learn more. And then also,
discussions allows us to see,

801
00:50:04,188 --> 00:50:07,429
"Okay, yeah. Maybe we're missing
something here or we could add

802
00:50:07,429 --> 00:50:10,554
this. Now, here's an issue." And "Hey,
since you brought it up, do you

803
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:14,693
want to be the one to make the
pull request for that

804
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:19,673
project?" So, it is- it is step one
is -- well, maybe it's not step

805
00:50:19,673 --> 00:50:23,333
one. But a good step is
identifying what good projects

806
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:26,693
look like so you can see them
at other places.

807
00:50:27,768 --> 00:50:28,548
Chad: Definitely agree.

00:50:28,548 --> 00:50:28,700
Bekah: Now-

808
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,184
Dan: I'm sorry, I'm kinda --

808
00:50:29,184 --> 00:50:32,764
Bekah: -I'm -- I kinda wanna
pivot a little bit before we end

809
00:50:32,793 --> 00:50:35,974
the podcast episode and talk more
about Tech is Hiring. Because, you

810
00:50:35,974 --> 00:50:38,583
know, all the things that we've
talked about, along with open

811
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:42,184
source, I think contribute to
this idea of Tech is Hiring, the

812
00:50:42,184 --> 00:50:47,523
idea of community, of connection,
of navigating through a problem

813
00:50:47,528 --> 00:50:52,833
that you identified. So what kind
of started your inspiration for

814
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:53,704
Tech is Hiring?

815
00:50:54,893 --> 00:51:00,114
Chad: Well, it started really
with my own job search. I- I

816
00:51:00,114 --> 00:51:03,204
don't even know how I came across
this. But I realized that, you

817
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:05,844
know, you could just make a tweet
and say, "Hey, I'm looking for a

818
00:51:05,844 --> 00:51:09,204
role." And people retweet it. Like,
people are very -- at the very

819
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:12,963
least in- in- in the tech industry,
or on tech Twitter, people

820
00:51:13,074 --> 00:51:19,518
are very open about, you know, helping
people find new roles. And so,

821
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:22,849
you know, I was doing that a few
times, like, in my own job search.

822
00:51:23,148 --> 00:51:26,268
And then I think one day I was
retweeting and I was just

823
00:51:26,268 --> 00:51:30,498
realized, you know, if you don't
have a good network and -- yeah, if

824
00:51:30,498 --> 00:51:33,798
you don't have a good network,
you know, l-l-likelihood of you-

825
00:51:33,878 --> 00:51:39,333
you -- the likelihood of your
tweet going viral in a sense it --

826
00:51:39,393 --> 00:51:43,833
that would help you is- is- is
pretty low. And so, you know, my

827
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:46,384
first thought was like, "Hey, do
we have like a hashtag or

828
00:51:46,384 --> 00:51:52,143
something that we can, you know,
that we can ... like, post our

829
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:54,963
tweet to? So at the very least,
you know, it's in one centralized

830
00:51:54,963 --> 00:51:58,759
place?" And people were like, "No."
And I was just like, "Okay." And

831
00:51:58,759 --> 00:52:01,188
somebody had reached out and they
were little like, "Oh, so you're

832
00:52:01,188 --> 00:52:03,619
gonna make a hashtag, right?" And
I was like, "I guess I am now."

833
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:05,500
[laughs]. So I ended up like-

834
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:05,700
Bekah: Nice.

835
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,498
Chad: -it- it -- yeah [laughs].
I ended up taking like a couple of

834
00:52:09,498 --> 00:52:13,159
days, just kind of trying to come
up with a name. And then, you

835
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:16,458
know, I just made a quick post
and I was just like, "Hey, this

836
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:20,239
hashtag, you know, post to it if
you- if you wanted to -- if you

837
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:25,773
want to- to- to share your tweet."
And, like, I pretty much did

838
00:52:25,773 --> 00:52:30,574
that. And initially, when I- when
I made the first tweet, I didn't --

839
00:52:30,574 --> 00:52:35,193
I obviously didn't expect anybody
to like be jumping, you know, out

840
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:38,344
to the woodwork to kinda tweet to
it. So I just went out to my way

841
00:52:38,349 --> 00:52:42,648
to go find tweets, you know? So
for people to share, to just kind

842
00:52:42,653 --> 00:52:46,998
of encourage and to build that
kind of backlog, right? Of places --

843
00:52:47,028 --> 00:52:51,199
of- of- of resources and, you
know, it just kind of grew from

844
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:56,719
there. So like, I started
adding tweets every day, you

845
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:00,108
know -- every weekday I should say.
I started adding tweets every

846
00:53:00,108 --> 00:53:02,869
day, you know? Just took- took a
couple of minutes all to my day. In

847
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:05,088
fact, I'm probably gonna do that
right after I get off of this.

848
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:10,338
But took a couple of minutes
just went through all, you

849
00:53:10,338 --> 00:53:14,659
know, went and looked for- for
people looking for jobs or had

850
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:17,358
jobs to share. And I would just
ask them if I could add it to

851
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:21,739
Tech is Hiring. And I've just been
doing that. And, you know, at the

852
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:26,478
end of last year, I started doing
spaces around- around Tech is

853
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:29,958
Hiring when- when spaces, you
know, became a feature that was

854
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:35,298
open to the public. I started
doing that. And there's a --

855
00:53:35,304 --> 00:53:38,728
there's definitely a lot of
people who just kinda like,

856
00:53:39,028 --> 00:53:42,239
there's a lot of -- kind of -- I
don't wanna say there's a lot of

857
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:46,079
information that people tend to
lack, you know? Like, even --

858
00:53:46,168 --> 00:53:49,409
especially there's a lot of job
changes, right? So they may have

859
00:53:49,414 --> 00:53:54,418
existed in an industry for
periods of time. Maybe years,

860
00:53:54,418 --> 00:53:57,719
decades, right? And they're
transitioning into the tech

861
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:02,338
industry. And, like, a simple thing
as how to structure your resume

862
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:06,289
is- is something that they may not
necessarily know. You know what I

863
00:54:06,295 --> 00:54:09,918
mean? And it's actually fairly
difficult. It's not as difficult

864
00:54:09,918 --> 00:54:13,278
now because there's significantly
more resources, but it's fairly

865
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:17,268
different -- difficult to find out
how to structure your resume in a

866
00:54:17,268 --> 00:54:21,739
good way. And so, you know, I was
just like, you know, that's also

867
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:26,764
resources that people could have,
you know? Like, people have, you know,

868
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:30,213
hiring or just kind of job search
or just those kind of

869
00:54:30,213 --> 00:54:35,583
conversations on- on spaces. And
I'll share that, you know, when-

870
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:38,103
whenever I can. It's like, "Hey,
do mind if I add this to Tech is

871
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:42,244
Hiring," you know? And I guess
it just kinda evolved from there.

872
00:54:42,244 --> 00:54:46,083
I eventually started a newsletter
to kind of do the same thing,

873
00:54:46,414 --> 00:54:50,103
whereas like I have -- I'll
effectively curate the tweets

874
00:54:50,103 --> 00:54:56,778
that I see. And then I'll just, you know,
take five of the -- five people who are

875
00:54:56,778 --> 00:55:01,429
looking for jobs and then 10 jobs
during that week. And then any

876
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:05,389
additional, like, an- an additional
information, like, say for

877
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:08,148
instance, there was like a really
good thread about, you know,

878
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:13,128
again, let's keep it in context,
talking about resumes, you

879
00:55:13,128 --> 00:55:16,548
know? Like, I'll- I'll- I'll share
that anything that's a part of

880
00:55:16,548 --> 00:55:20,719
the hashtag. So I won't, like, go
searching for stuff. But anything

881
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:23,539
that's a part of the hashtag, you
know, that got retweeted by -- with

882
00:55:23,543 --> 00:55:27,378
the hashtag, I'll- I'll add that
to the newsletter, and so on and

883
00:55:27,378 --> 00:55:32,119
so forth. And, you know, it's
really just kind of been about --

884
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:37,773
just trying to be, like, make
it -- make that -- make the whole

885
00:55:37,773 --> 00:55:41,704
thing about either job searching
or transitioning, just job

886
00:55:41,704 --> 00:55:47,253
related stuff, make it easier,
you know? Especially -- so, like

887
00:55:47,259 --> 00:55:52,579
the- the- the thing about Twitter
is like when you go on LinkedIn

888
00:55:52,608 --> 00:55:57,289
or when you apply for a job in
any- in any- in any, I guess,

889
00:55:57,318 --> 00:56:02,358
standard way, right? You- you
upload your- your- your resume

890
00:56:02,364 --> 00:56:05,719
and so on and so forth. It's very
likely that you won't necessarily

891
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:08,358
get seen by a human for whatever
reason. I'm not even gonna get

892
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:10,969
into that. But for whatever
reason, you may not necessarily

893
00:56:10,974 --> 00:56:14,929
get seen by a human, you know? Or
-- I don't wanna say that. For

894
00:56:14,929 --> 00:56:17,719
whatever reason, you won't
interact with a human, I should say,

895
00:56:18,123 --> 00:56:21,333
you know? You may get some
automated email saying you were

896
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:26,884
rejected or you may not even get
to reply at all, right? But, you

897
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:30,994
know, for Tech is Hiring because
most of the times I'm retweeting

898
00:56:30,994 --> 00:56:34,684
tweets that somebody else made,
you know, a lot of the times that

899
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:37,925
person — and a lot of the times
it's a person --

900
00:56:38,014 --> 00:56:42,244
legitimate person. That person is
now kind of your- your

901
00:56:42,244 --> 00:56:46,563
interaction, the- the -- your point
of contact for that company. So say,

902
00:56:46,563 --> 00:56:49,563
for instance, let's- let's go
with AWS. A lot of people

903
00:56:49,563 --> 00:56:52,204
actually, when they -- when
they're- when they're sharing

904
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:55,414
job, they'll say, "Hey," you know,
like, in it's -- in particular cases,

905
00:56:55,414 --> 00:57:00,153
they'll say "I'll- I'll definitely ..."
not -- what's -- not sponsors. The

906
00:57:00,273 --> 00:57:04,369
-- what's the phrase? When they
recommend -- they- they'll

907
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:10,219
recommend you, you know? And so
you have that, excuse me, you

908
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:15,648
have that point of contact
with the organization, you know,

909
00:57:15,648 --> 00:57:20,418
and like, for- for- for getting
hired. Like, having somebody

910
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:24,164
recommend you, you know?
Especially like a big person

911
00:57:24,193 --> 00:57:28,603
recommending you is a huge deal,
you know? And for, like --

912
00:57:28,603 --> 00:57:32,293
especially for- for younger
engineers, they don't necessarily

913
00:57:32,293 --> 00:57:35,173
have that network to have
somebody recommend them for a

914
00:57:35,173 --> 00:57:39,673
job. You know what I mean? And
so, you know, when somebody posts

915
00:57:39,673 --> 00:57:43,873
that, you know, their job is
looking for a- a position and

916
00:57:44,304 --> 00:57:47,384
somebody sees that, they can go
and just reach out to them. They

917
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:53,028
can send them a DM or they can
send them a reply. And, like, that-

918
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:57,108
that interaction is significantly
better. That even if you're qual-

919
00:57:57,168 --> 00:57:59,418
I mean, to be fair, if you're
qualified for the job, you're

920
00:57:59,418 --> 00:58:02,869
qualified for the job. But just
having that kind of point of

921
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:05,809
contact, you know? Maybe it's not
the job for you, but you don't

922
00:58:05,809 --> 00:58:07,489
know that, you know? You're not
gonna know that until you

923
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:10,728
interview. So you can sit down
and talk with them, you know?

924
00:58:10,733 --> 00:58:15,259
Like, just having that point of
contact is so important, you

925
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:19,338
know? So, like, that's kind of the
real value of Tech is Hiring

926
00:58:19,338 --> 00:58:22,909
currently is. It's not even
necessarily the resources that

927
00:58:22,914 --> 00:58:27,858
get shared. It's the resources and
the people who actually share

928
00:58:27,864 --> 00:58:31,128
them and your ability to interact
with them, you know? That's

929
00:58:31,128 --> 00:58:34,398
really the- the- the main thing
about Tech is Hiring.

930
00:58:35,074 --> 00:58:37,114
