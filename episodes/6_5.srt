00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,691
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to

00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:16,100
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,821
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:22,640
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:25,850
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,431
stories and what they've learned.
And we are here to share it with

7
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:30,830
you here with me. Today is my
co-host.

8
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:39,831
Dan: What up Beck? How is it
going today?

9
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:43,191
Bekah: Just never know, never
know what, how you're going to

10
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:49,070
deliver that. Um, it is, is going
amazingly fantastic today.

11
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:55,625
Dan: that is impressive. Um,
That's good. Cuz uh, today we had

12
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,295
an amazingly fantastic guest, uh,
Chad Stewart.

13
00:00:58,731 --> 00:00:59,810
Bekah: Who is also awesome.

14
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:02,975
Dan: He is also awesome. Yeah, we
that's obvious because he is on

15
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:04,445
our podcast. So like,

16
00:01:04,445 --> 00:01:05,676
Bekah: Yeah, it was implied.

17
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:09,275
Dan: at this point. Yeah. Uh, but
yeah, he's a Chad's software

18
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:13,865
engineer from Kingston, Jamaica,
and um, yeah, we had a good time

19
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,135
talking to him and he talked a
lot about his experience with

20
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:23,135
open source and um, also his. I
don't know what you call it. He's

21
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:25,536
got a newsletter in his surf
project. Yeah. Called, uh, Tech

22
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:30,305
is Hiring. And, um, I, he told us
a lot about, a lot about that and

23
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:32,585
how, how he got into that. And
you know, how it works and stuff

24
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:33,066
is, is very.

25
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:36,066
Bekah: Yeah, I love how
organically it started. You know,

26
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:40,626
he saw a need for something that
in the wider tech industry. And

27
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:43,715
then somebody mentioned to him
like, Hey, what do you think

28
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:48,006
about doing something more with
this? And he just went with that.

29
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:50,825
And I think that's a really great
way to find inspiration and

30
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:52,475
energy from the things that
you're doing.

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,290
Dan: Absolutely. Um, I mean, it's
always good to talk to Chad. He's

32
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,355
he's very funny. He's, he's one
of our, uh, main contributors to

33
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:06,575
our humor channel in, in, in our
slack. Um, and yeah, it was

34
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:09,725
fascinating hearing about his,
uh, his experience with all that

35
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:11,705
stuff. And with, uh, the Open
Sauced, that was the other,

36
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:14,316
that's the big project that he
volunteers with contributes with.

37
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:18,485
And, um, he talked a lot about
how you don't have to be writing

38
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:23,015
code to contribute to an open
source project. And I both agree

39
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:26,316
with that. very much and, and
appreciate the, the way he talked

40
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:27,366
about his experiences.

41
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:31,985
Bekah: Yeah. Uh, and we start
this episode of the podcast. Like

42
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,866
we start every Virtual Coffee. We
introduce ourselves with our

43
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:37,776
name, where we're from, what we
do and a random checking

44
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:49,097
question. We hope you enjoy this
episode. Our random check-in

45
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:52,787
question is if you could have any
animal for a pet, what would it

46
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:52,997
be?

47
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:54,187
Chad: Uh, Cheetah.

48
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:56,956
Bekah: not yet.

49
00:02:57,676 --> 00:02:57,977
Chad: Oh,

50
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:00,887
Bekah: And how is it not a
penguin? That's what I wanna

51
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:01,037
know.

52
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:05,796
Chad: uh, I like Cheetahs. It'd
be Cheetah or a Peregrine Falcon.

53
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:07,157
Those are my favorite animals.

54
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:12,592
Bekah: All right. Um, my name is
Bekah. I am a technical community

55
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,372
builder from a small town in
Ohio. And if I could have any

56
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:24,382
animal for a pet, I really like,
um, red pandas and ring-tailed

57
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:29,662
lemurs. So those are on the top
of the list, but a Falcon seems

58
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:33,532
like it would be pretty cool.
I've already got a skinny pig. So

59
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:37,252
I feel like half of my dreams
have been fulfilled already.

60
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:41,373
Dan: Um, yeah, that thing is
horrifying.

61
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:42,979
Bekah: cute. It's adorable.

62
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:45,334
Dan: It's not, they're supposed
to have fur

63
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:49,758
Bekah: uh, it doesn't, it doesn't
have fur. It's a tiny

64
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:52,818
hippopotamus. So if you're not
familiar with what a skinny pig

65
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:56,299
is, it is a hairless Guinea pig
that looks like a tiny hippo.

66
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:02,899
Super cute. Google. It, it is so
cute. Dan, stop it. Stop hating

67
00:04:02,903 --> 00:04:03,588
on my pet

68
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:05,824
Dan: I mean, this is from a
person who likes the hairless

69
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:06,153
cats

70
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:07,188
Bekah: love hairless

71
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:09,183
Dan: they're like the most
horrifying thing in the world,

72
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:10,938
Bekah: No, they're not. They're
so great. Especially when they're

73
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:12,889
angry looking, they're just like
great.

74
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:24,814
Dan: that um, okay. Hi, I'm Dan.
I am a developer of. Computer

75
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:31,353
things. uh, I live in Cleveland,
Ohio. Um, yeah. So are we

76
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:33,064
sticking with real world animals?

77
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,403
Bekah: if you want a mini dragon,
you can have one.

78
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:39,783
Dan: A mini dragon? I was gonna
say the dragon guy from The Never

79
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:42,274
Ending Story, although he is like
a little

80
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:44,264
Chad: File core. Falkor.

81
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:48,588
Dan: yeah. Falkor, uh, I was
gonna say, um, What's the word

82
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:52,548
for like, when you, when a person
like a, a being can like talk and

83
00:04:52,548 --> 00:04:53,238
think and stuff.

84
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:55,434
Bekah: Amorphism.

85
00:04:55,579 --> 00:05:00,769
Dan: no. Like a, like a conscious
or, you know, like he has, he's a

86
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:04,309
little too much of a human, not a
human, but like a thinking thing

87
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:05,358
to be like, have a,

88
00:05:05,374 --> 00:05:07,274
Bekah: he's an anthropomorphized

89
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,978
Dan: but I'm saying, like, I'm
saying, like, since

90
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:11,869
Chad: a taxpayer to me, to be
honest with

91
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:13,819
Dan: there's a word, there's a
word for what I'm looking for.

92
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:17,163
And I, I can't think of the word,
but. What I mean is like, I would

93
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:19,803
feel bad keeping him as a pet
because he has like too much of

94
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:22,834
his own, you know, consciousness,
you know what I mean? Like he

95
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:25,504
like talks and he is like his own
thing. So I don't think he'd

96
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:27,454
wanna be a pet. And that would
make me sad. Um,

97
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,598
Bekah: Well, like what about dogs
that run away all the time? Did

98
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:31,608
they really wanna be pet? Should
they be free too?

99
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:39,004
Dan: I mean, I don't know. uh, I
mean, that's a good question.

100
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:42,153
Should any pets be pets? You
know? Yeah. Yeah.

101
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:43,699
Bekah: one of those moral
conundrums.

102
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:47,644
Dan: if you truly love it, then
set it free and it'll come back

103
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:48,994
or something. how does that go?

104
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:51,769
Bekah: if it comes back, it's
yours and that's how you know

105
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:56,149
that is lyrics in a Christine
Aguilar song. I refrain from

106
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:57,199
singing it for you.

107
00:05:57,363 --> 00:06:02,043
Dan: uh, oh man. All right. Um,
anyway, that's my answer. I'm I'm

108
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:04,613
going, if we have to stick with
real world, I'd say sloth though

109
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:07,983
sloths are really cool and you
know, I'd, I'd like, I'd totally

110
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:11,434
like just chill in the backyard
with the. If it's real world real

111
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:12,874
world animal. That's that's my
answer.

112
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:16,353
Bekah: I was in Costa Rica when I
was like 19 or 20, and that was a

113
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:19,153
highlight to get, to see the
three toed and the two toed

114
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:19,483
sloths.

115
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:20,524
Dan: Oh yeah. Nice.

116
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:23,014
Bekah: just welcome, Chad.

117
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:24,423
Dan: yeah, go ahead, Chad.

118
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:28,983
Chad: Yeah. So I'm Chad Stewart.
I'm a software engineer, um, in,

119
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:32,524
currently in Kingston, Jamaica,
uh, mostly do front end

120
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:37,084
engineering stuff. Um, right now
though, I'm hopefully

121
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:40,264
transitioning to doing more full
stack stuff. And I guess I

122
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:42,634
answered this earlier, but it
would be either a Cheetah or

123
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:46,564
Peregrine Falcon. Those are my
favorite animals. They're fast. I

124
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:51,423
like fast animals. I don't know.
Yeah. And I like birds. um,

125
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:56,074
which, uh, Bekah might have,
Bekah alluded to earlier, um,

126
00:06:56,074 --> 00:06:58,894
with a different type of bird.
Um, but

127
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,738
Dan: Yeah. Did you ever read, uh,
either of you ever read, um, My

128
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:04,418
Side of the Mountain.

129
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:05,728
Bekah: Yes.

130
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:06,783
Chad: I, I

131
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,454
Dan: you read that Chad? So it's
a, it's like a, it's like a young

132
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:12,603
adult book, I think, but it it's
about a kid who runs away and

133
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,574
goes and lives in the woods, like
with, with nothing, you know, and

134
00:07:15,574 --> 00:07:19,144
teaches himself how to sort of
forage and hunt and fish or

135
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:24,004
whatever. And he eventually like
goes and get like steals a Falcon

136
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:27,514
baby, uh, from a nest and, and
then like raises it and trains

137
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,524
it. And it becomes his like
friend and stuff. It's really

138
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:34,788
cool. Um, That sounds cool. It
would be, it would be really cool

139
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,968
to have a Falcon as a pet and
like, could just like, hang out

140
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:41,509
with you on your shoulder. Is
that, what do you think you'd do

141
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:43,098
shoulder or just your arm thing?
I

142
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:46,264
Chad: Uh, depends on the Falcon.
I'm, you know, considering the

143
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:49,324
talent, it would probably not
necessarily rest on your shoulder

144
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:50,824
and rest in your shoulder. You
know

145
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,158
Dan: right, right.

146
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,918
Bekah: Like a very leather
shoulder pad or something.

147
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:58,024
Dan: Yeah. Little contraption
for, to hang out on. Feel like

148
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:01,173
you'd wanna like, hang, you know,
keep you, keep him with you when,

149
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:03,274
uh, when he is not like, when he
is not cruising around,

150
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:07,488
Bekah: If I am ever famous and I
go to an award show, I'm gonna

151
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:11,569
come with a Falcon on my
shoulder. Just decided it seems

152
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:11,689
like

153
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:13,564
Dan: you're keying a conference,
you should do it there.

154
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:17,298
Bekah: I don't think I have
enough time to, uh, train a

155
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:19,759
Falcon. I've got like three
weeks.

156
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:21,274
Dan: that's not enough time.

157
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:22,668
Bekah: I don't know.

158
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:25,249
Dan: Well, yeah, this episode
will come out after that. Anyway.

159
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:29,478
So, uh, next time you're the
keynote speaker at a conference.

160
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,639
That'll be you just put that.

161
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:37,083
Bekah: be my thing. Kirk says my
thing is crying while I give

162
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,203
talks. And that is the thing I
would like to not be doing. I

163
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:48,504
would rather be the, the Falcon
shoulder person. welcome. This

164
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:54,288
is, this is the normal intro for
us. Um, And it is a Friday that

165
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:58,129
we are recording on. So, um,
brains don't work on Fridays. Uh,

166
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:01,879
everybody knows that. So you're
gonna have to bear with us today.

167
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:06,109
Um, but we will, we'll give you
the mic now, so you don't have to

168
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:09,349
listen to me talk anymore. We
always love to hear your origin

169
00:09:09,354 --> 00:09:12,708
story. How did you come into tech
and get to this point in your

170
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:13,249
tech journey?

171
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:19,594
Chad: Uh, yeah, so, um, I guess I
give a kind of quick synopsis of,

172
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:26,614
of what I did. Uh, so I moved to
the United States, um, for some

173
00:09:26,614 --> 00:09:30,528
time, uh, To be honest, to, to go
to art school because I wanted to

174
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:34,849
be a, a game developer and I, but
I couldn't draw very well at the

175
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:38,599
time. So I ended up into another
program, which effectively was

176
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:42,168
web design. Um, whatever the, it
was the art Institute of Fort

177
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:45,438
Lauderdale, it was whatever they
had kind of called web design.

178
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:49,009
And I did that for some time
graduated and then phoned. I

179
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:53,479
didn't necessarily like web
design. Or at least what it was

180
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:58,698
at the time. And so I ended up
going back to another school. Uh,

181
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:02,269
I'm pretty sure the south IANS
would kind of know the schools

182
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,389
that I'm talking about. Well,
people know art Institute, but,

183
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,259
um, for the south IANS, uh, I
went back to NSU, Nova

184
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:13,788
Southeastern university, got a, a
software engineering degree from

185
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:19,908
there. And then did some work
ended up returning home, um, and

186
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:24,469
have been kind of working around
ever since. Um, during the

187
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:29,734
pandemic I was unemployed. And
that's how I came across, you

188
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:33,933
know, Bekah and Dan and Virtual
Coffee, um, when they were, when

189
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,443
they were hosting, well, they're
still hosting. Um, they're still

190
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:41,553
hosting zoom, um, zoom calls, but
that's how I came across them.

191
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:48,423
And I've mostly been kind of
active on Twitter. Um, so I, I,

192
00:10:48,423 --> 00:10:53,076
you know, I met, I met Dan and,
and Bekah during 2020, um, 20,

193
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:59,614
20, 20, 21. Um, I decided. To
start an organization, uh, call

194
00:10:59,614 --> 00:11:04,984
Tech is Hiring, um, tech pretty
much. What I do is I retweet job

195
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:10,984
opportunities as I come across
them on Twitter. Um, and I re re

196
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:15,484
I also retweet, um, people
looking for, for opportunities.

197
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:20,764
And so. I've been doing that for
about, for, for a little bit over

198
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:25,923
a year now. And yeah, like that's
pretty much it. We, we do have,

199
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:31,563
we, uh, have some presence on
LinkedIn, but mostly still on

200
00:11:31,563 --> 00:11:36,274
Twitter, have a newsletter, uh,
been doing the newsletter thing.

201
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:38,403
Haven't missed a week. I'm
actually pretty happy about that.

202
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:43,879
But, uh, have, have been doing a
newsletter for. Uh, couple of

203
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:47,568
months now, I think over six
months now. And yeah, that's

204
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:51,769
pretty much me. I'm, I'm working
now, you know, thankfully and my

205
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:56,089
opportunities are increasing
because of the amount of work

206
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,239
that I've been doing and people
I've been reaching out to and so

207
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:03,828
on and so forth. But yeah. Um,
yeah, it's pretty much me right

208
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:04,009
now.

209
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:08,193
Bekah: That's awesome. And we're
gonna dive into Tech is Hiring a

210
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:11,464
little bit more, but before we
jump into that, I know that

211
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,313
you've been doing, you know, a
lot of different community things

212
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:17,494
and some of that's been open
source work. Do you wanna talk

213
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:21,813
about what you've been doing with
open source and how you've, uh,

214
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:22,984
been a contributor as well?

215
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:28,833
Chad: Uh, yes. Uh, yes. So, um, I
recently started open source

216
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:33,394
doing more open source work. Um,
uh, funny enough, I started with

217
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:37,653
the. The, um, the open source
project that I had started with,

218
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:42,874
um, which is open source by, uh,
Brian Douglas, um, at B Dougie

219
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:49,024
on, on Twitter. Um, and he
honestly, he approached me to ask

220
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:53,793
me to, to, to, to, to contribute
to his project. And I did. Um,

221
00:12:53,823 --> 00:13:01,234
but I didn't stay initially
mostly because of just all other

222
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:06,798
stuff that I kind of had going
on. At the time. Um, but he again

223
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:12,678
approached me later. Um, he again
approached me later that year,

224
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:16,369
uh, really late in the year,
mostly because of Tech is Hiring.

225
00:13:16,668 --> 00:13:20,178
And then he, you know, he wants
to wanted me to, to come on to,

226
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:26,328
to contribute more, um, More
again, and that's what I've been

227
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:31,249
kind of doing, um, for the last
couple of months. And you know,

228
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:36,918
his, his project is pretty much
about kind of having it, it being

229
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:40,668
a platform of, of people, you
know, transitioning into

230
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:45,558
contributing for open source. Um,
it's in a bit of, uh, I don't

231
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:51,739
wanna call it limbo, but if the
kind of scope is Evolv. At this

232
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:55,548
point. Um, so, you know, we're,
we're all kind of trying to

233
00:13:55,548 --> 00:14:03,318
figure it OT recently, uh, left
GitHub to, to work on, on open

234
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:09,129
source fulltime. And so. You
know, as he does that, and he's

235
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:13,359
putting a lot more like of his
full, you know, effort into it.

236
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:17,739
He's been, uh, he's been kind of
expanding on that and I've really

237
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:21,038
been helping, uh, here and there.
So like for instance, one of the

238
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:24,369
things that I did, I'm pretty
kind of happy about this is that

239
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:27,698
the, the, the onboarding
experience for open source was.

240
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:33,229
Was a little bit disjointed and,
you know, he had managed to, to,

241
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:37,249
to get some designs, um, and to
just kind of change the

242
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:40,969
onboarding experience. And that
was like one of the first major

243
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:47,688
things that had helped him with,
um, when I started contributing

244
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:52,609
more often and, you know, been
doing it. For I've been working

245
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,599
on the project ever since. Uh, it
there's two projects. There's

246
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:01,009
open source, the, the, the app,
the, the, the regular app. And

247
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:05,089
then you have hot open source,
which is like a, a, a, a, a,

248
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:10,399
another, not a child app, but
just that app alongside of it, I

249
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:12,889
haven't been working with hot
open sauce, but yeah, that's

250
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:18,379
pretty much what I've been doing.
And, you know, you interact with

251
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:23,149
the community, you know, you get
to talk to you, you, you talk to

252
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:27,288
people here and there, like, so
it is kind of interesting because

253
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:31,609
he has a, he has a discord, which
I, I interact with a few times,

254
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:34,849
but. To be honest, a lot of the
interactions kind of come, come

255
00:15:34,849 --> 00:15:38,749
through his stream. Uh, I feel
like a lot of people just kind of

256
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:41,658
come there. And then there's also
times where he'll have like a

257
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:45,769
call on his discord and, you
know, that's where you, you have

258
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:48,408
some really interesting
conversations, you know, about

259
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:51,619
the project and about kind of how
it's evolving, but just generally

260
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:55,339
about software engineering. I
think that's like in terms of,

261
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,369
um, in terms of open source,
that's the thing that I kind of

262
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:03,349
want. I I really think is the
most important is your kind of

263
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:07,219
access to information that you
wouldn't regularly have, or not

264
00:16:07,219 --> 00:16:10,788
even necessarily access, because
if you've heard these terms,

265
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:14,778
you've heard a lot of the.
Technologies and stuff. You

266
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:17,629
probably, you can Google them or,
you know, they're, they're that

267
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:22,308
open, but like the likelihood of
you coming across that as

268
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:25,578
somebody who's just not in the
know, you know, is very

269
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:28,759
difficult. And I think that's
like the, the key thing that,

270
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:33,484
that open source has been. Um,
helping me with is just coming

271
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:38,104
across these technologies and
these people and, you know, just

272
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:41,524
getting to know them, you know,
even if it's still more of a

273
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,124
passive LA, not passive, but as
a, I don't know the person

274
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:47,313
directly, or I don't know, I
haven't interacted with the

275
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:52,413
technology, but just having them
as like in your Rolodex of things

276
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:55,293
that you could leverage, you
know, is extraordinarily.

277
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:59,433
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. I love
that. And I love Brian Douglas

278
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:02,764
too. He's pretty awesome. I
actually, uh, he's gonna be doing

279
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:07,263
a lunch and learn at Virtual
Coffee, um, which is super

280
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:11,253
exciting. We're gonna talk about
open source and open sauce and

281
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:15,963
Octoberfest. So that'll be coming
up in September. I'm really glad

282
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:21,588
to. Um, have him getting us in
the, in the mind frame of

283
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:26,298
prepping to do some open source
contribution because that's I,

284
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:29,719
the beginning kind of, of the
Virtual Coffee, origin story,

285
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:33,558
maybe. Um, it's not the first
thing that we did, but, uh, it

286
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:38,148
was the first time I felt like
Virtual Coffee was gonna be an

287
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:42,888
organization that outlasts the
pandemic. Um, I thought for a

288
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:45,989
long time that it was like, Hey,
we're. Get together and

289
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:49,949
everybody's feeling isolated. And
then we did Oktoberfest, our

290
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:53,909
first Octoberfest initiative, and
everybody was just so excited

291
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:57,989
about it and contributing. And we
had maintainers and contributors

292
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:02,614
and lots of mentorship and
support, and it was. It was fun,

293
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:07,233
but really gratifying to see
people contributing and learning

294
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:10,023
and growing through that
experience. And, you know, it can

295
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:13,173
be, it can be scary to get
involved and do your first

296
00:18:13,173 --> 00:18:16,923
contribution. Um, even if you've
been in tech, we had a number of

297
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:19,324
people who have been in tech for
a while, and I've never done an

298
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:22,624
open source contribution. So, you
know, what advice do you have for

299
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:26,344
folks who are maybe a little bit
nervous about entering that open

300
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:27,394
source experience?

301
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:32,808
Chad: Uh, that's a, that's a
really interesting question. Um,

302
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:41,568
Hmm. What advice would I give? So
I would say, um, find community,

303
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:48,304
you know, like that. So the, the,
the. The open source projects

304
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:54,094
that I would definitely look,
look to, um, are open source

305
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:58,953
projects that are very much not
just about the, the, the

306
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:03,483
contributions, but you know, like
the, the, whatever you kind of

307
00:19:03,513 --> 00:19:07,294
deliver, whatever you merge, you
know, but significantly more

308
00:19:07,294 --> 00:19:12,798
about the community of people.
Um, and just kind of the culture

309
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,909
around the, the, the open source
project, like that's really

310
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:21,469
important, you know, like there
are a lot of there, you know,

311
00:19:21,469 --> 00:19:27,048
people give the advice of, of,
you know, contribute to like you,

312
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:30,378
you, their tools that you use all
the time, like react and so on

313
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:34,503
and so forth, you know, you want
to contribute to those and. You

314
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:37,263
know, some of them are hit and
miss, but a lot of the times

315
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:44,493
they're so big that they they're
really hard to get into, you

316
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:48,753
know, like I, I wanted to, I, you
know, I heard the whole thing.

317
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:51,094
It's like, you should, you should
contribute to open source. It's

318
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:54,394
great. And so I was like, okay,
I'll contribute to open source.

319
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,824
You know, which, which product
I'm going to try, I'm gonna try

320
00:19:56,824 --> 00:20:00,213
to contribute to react. There's a
bunch of good first issues there.

321
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:04,804
And I was just. What you know
what I mean? Like, I couldn't

322
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,013
understand anything that they
were asking, and this was like a

323
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:11,614
couple of years back and I, you
know, I tried it a few times and

324
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:14,703
I was just like, I'm gonna go do
something else. You know what I

325
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:17,493
mean? So it's like really
important to kind of have that

326
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:21,663
community, like have, have those
people being very welcoming, you

327
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:26,068
know, having the discord, like a
lot of. The secondary stuff to

328
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:31,259
the, to the, to the actual
working code and tools is, is

329
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:35,638
really important. Um, the second
thing, and I'm, I'm really happy.

330
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:40,709
I remember this. The second thing
is that you don't necessarily

331
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:44,673
have to contribute code. You
know, it's not just about code,

332
00:20:44,673 --> 00:20:48,183
there's a lot of other things
that you can contribute, and that

333
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:51,993
would be a contribution to open
source, like contributing, uh,

334
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:59,824
documentation, you know, like I
know, uh, uh, Brian for, for open

335
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:04,683
source, he has a triage team for,
for triaging issues. I believe

336
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:13,384
that's, um, like. You know, find
you taking, I'm sorry if I'm, I

337
00:21:13,384 --> 00:21:17,223
hope I'm getting this right. But
like you, you take when, when

338
00:21:17,223 --> 00:21:20,523
there's issues, you know, you
kind of scope them out so that

339
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:24,153
there's something that somebody
can easily take on. And I believe

340
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:29,763
he got that idea from the node,
from node, which nodes, from my

341
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:33,693
understanding. For the longest
time, I really wanted to join the

342
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:38,433
open source community for node
because they seemed so welcoming.

343
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:43,233
You know, they seemed to have all
of this kind of infrastructure in

344
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:48,328
place for a new person to come in
and. Really be able to

345
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:52,618
contribute, you know, like I
don't remember exactly everything

346
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:55,048
that they have now, but like they
have, you know, they have stuff

347
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:58,019
on YouTube. They have them weak,
they have weekly meetings on

348
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:02,638
YouTube, you know, like they have
like this whole community around

349
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:07,499
joining them. And so I'll try not
to go into the community thing

350
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:11,929
again, but like, there are a lot
of things that you can do to. You

351
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:15,048
know, like you can contribute
documentation, like for, for, for

352
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:18,618
the no project. Like, I believe
you can do something like just

353
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:21,288
kind of help managing the
meetings that they have because

354
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:25,878
they regularly have meetings, but
there are a lot of outside things

355
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:30,499
outside of like literally writing
the code that needs to go into

356
00:22:30,503 --> 00:22:35,209
the project that can go, that can
go in there and people have

357
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:40,413
literally gotten opportu. From
contributing to open source, um,

358
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:44,854
open source projects in these
auxiliary ways, you know? And so.

359
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:47,778
I would, so the thing that I
would definitely stress is

360
00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:50,989
community. You know, like
community is extraordinarily

361
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:55,219
important, you know, having
people to have your back, you

362
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:58,578
know, when you're contributing is
really important, to be quite

363
00:22:58,584 --> 00:23:02,628
honest, I would say that it's
much more important to, to, to

364
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:05,358
build and maintain those
relationships than it is to

365
00:23:05,358 --> 00:23:09,064
contribute the code. In my
opinion. It's much more important

366
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:11,884
to have those relationships. In
fact, I would say that's the most

367
00:23:11,884 --> 00:23:16,804
important thing about open source
and that it's not just about

368
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:21,153
contributing code. You don't need
to contribute code it. It's

369
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:25,173
about, you can contribute in, in
your own way, just reach out. And

370
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:28,953
there might be things that, that,
you know, that the, the, the

371
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,854
maintainer needs and, you know,
you may be able to help help

372
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:36,903
there, but just, I guess, to kind
of sum up at the very least the

373
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:39,933
last part is just be very open
ended on how you, how you'd like

374
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:42,903
to contribute to the community.
You know, like you don't

375
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:45,153
necessarily have to contribute
something that, you know, gets

376
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:49,209
merged into a poll request. Yeah,
but just be very open minded on

377
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:52,749
how you'd contribute to the
community, to, to that community

378
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:57,398
and focus on community. You know,
even if it's a small community,

379
00:23:57,398 --> 00:24:01,598
just focus on the relationships
that you're building with with

380
00:24:01,598 --> 00:24:04,689
these people. It's not just
about, you know, you write

381
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:08,108
something and then you merge
requests and then you, you know,

382
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:11,378
you go off somewhere, you know,
it's about building those

383
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:15,269
relationships. You know, that,
that's what I would say. Sorry

384
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:15,509
for cutting.

385
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:18,903
Bekah: no, no. I love that. I
love focusing, especially for

386
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:22,084
first time contributors on that
interaction on the community

387
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:26,433
building of things, because
getting into open source can be

388
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:30,574
really nerve-wracking or seem
really hard to do, but you're

389
00:24:30,574 --> 00:24:33,544
right. If you find that right
community, it makes it a lot

390
00:24:33,548 --> 00:24:36,394
easier for you and you are
building those relationships.

391
00:24:36,723 --> 00:24:41,588
And, you know, if we look at even
some of the larger. Open source

392
00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:45,759
projects. Sometimes, sometimes
there's a need for smaller

393
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,929
contributions or sometimes their
first time contributor issues are

394
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:52,929
exactly like what you were
talking about. Like, I have no

395
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:56,499
idea what you're talking about.
This is not for me. And then

396
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:59,753
that's okay. You know, there are
other. Opportunities out there.

397
00:24:59,993 --> 00:25:02,693
And this is one of my pet peeves
where people are like, this is

398
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:05,513
not in the spirit of hack Tober
Fest. And they wanna say like,

399
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:09,713
oh, you can't make a contribution
that looks like this or that just

400
00:25:09,713 --> 00:25:15,338
changes one thing. Um, and I, I
think that. Maybe that's how you

401
00:25:15,338 --> 00:25:19,568
feel about your project, but that
doesn't necessarily apply to

402
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:22,568
other people's projects. There
are a lot of projects out there

403
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:26,709
that are community run that are
people who are trying to

404
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:30,269
collaborate and work together and
support other people. So there

405
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:34,118
are lots of different projects,
there's different approaches to

406
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:38,318
open source contribution and
finding that community that's

407
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:41,138
going to support you is going to
help you to make that

408
00:25:41,548 --> 00:25:41,949
contribution.

409
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:46,078
Chad: Absolutely. Absolutely
agree. And I'd like to touch on a

410
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:50,068
little bit about, you know, there
are a lot of kind of community

411
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:56,209
run projects. Um, I've been
there. So this is kind of funny.

412
00:25:56,269 --> 00:26:00,588
Uh, I went through this, looking
up a lot of interview prep stuff.

413
00:26:00,594 --> 00:26:04,398
Cause to be quite honest, I did a
lot of that within the last, not

414
00:26:04,403 --> 00:26:08,148
within the last couple of months,
but, um, years prior I was doing

415
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:14,374
a lot of interview prep and there
are so many kind of. You know,

416
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:18,334
thing, I don't know if they're
necessarily open source projects,

417
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:21,723
but they're projects that, you
know, have a that's, you know,

418
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:25,894
open to the world. And, you know,
like as far as I know, it's not

419
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:30,003
the paid product, you know, I
thinks, yeah. I don't think it's

420
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:33,334
a paid product. Like for
instance, there's, there's the

421
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:36,483
algorithms, which is something
that I just recently found out

422
00:26:36,753 --> 00:26:41,568
about, which. Literally a project
of a bunch of kind of data

423
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:46,788
structures and algorithms that
you would see in interviews. Um,

424
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:50,689
and it's like a huge kind of log
of them in different languages.

425
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:54,169
You know what I mean? And as far
as I know, that's not a paid

426
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:57,108
product, it's just out there, you
know, and like I was bookmarking

427
00:26:57,108 --> 00:27:00,019
a bunch of these things, but
there's that, there's that like,

428
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:04,489
there's the, the, the, what you
call it, the tech interview

429
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:09,739
handbook, which kind of gives you
like a real. You know, it's a

430
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:13,429
great breakdown of how
interviewing is how you study,

431
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:16,939
you know, what you, what people
are, are looking funny enough.

432
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:21,499
The thing that I, that draw me to
that was, you know, what, you

433
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:25,159
know, there, it described like
how people are, are kind of

434
00:27:25,163 --> 00:27:28,788
looking, looking at you at like
big tech interview group. The

435
00:27:28,788 --> 00:27:31,368
point I'm making is all of those
things. When you look at them on

436
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:35,778
GitHub, they're really just like
marked on. I think they are, but

437
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:38,449
they're, they're not like
anything crazy, you know, you're

438
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:42,979
not like using Redux to, to
display all of this information,

439
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:47,884
you know what I mean? But those
projects like that. Hundreds of

440
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:51,903
contributors and you know, like
you can contribute to that

441
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:55,233
project. Say, say for instance,
you've done a massive amount of

442
00:27:55,233 --> 00:27:58,384
interviewing to, to kind of stay
in context, the ma a massive

443
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:02,223
amount of interviewing and you
feel like there's an issue here.

444
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:06,084
Issue with some of the
information here you could most

445
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,953
definitely reach out or, or, or
apply a change. And I mean, even

446
00:28:09,953 --> 00:28:11,993
then it's like, all of this is
kind of talking about

447
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:15,624
information, right? So, you know,
say there's like typos or it's

448
00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:19,163
just not as clear, you can
definitely just, you know, clear

449
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:24,604
up that information or reach out
to whoever and, and. That isn't

450
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:28,834
necessarily code in the, in, in
the sense that most people think

451
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:31,804
of open source projects. When
people think of open or

452
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:35,523
contributing to open source
projects, they think about adding

453
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:42,213
a feature or refactoring very
much like code, you know, very

454
00:28:42,213 --> 00:28:47,493
much. Like that very particular
use case when there's, like I

455
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:52,114
said, there's a whole breadth of
things that you can, you can, you

456
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:56,284
can do. And I mean, we're, we're
even, even this conversation,

457
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:59,919
we're kind of talking about the
at least. The way I'm kind of

458
00:28:59,923 --> 00:29:03,038
thinking about it is like, if
you're doing open source, you're

459
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:06,308
literally on GitHub, you
literally go to the project and

460
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:09,489
then it's just like, however,
right. But, you know, if you're,

461
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,209
if the, the open source project
has a community, you know, you

462
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:17,378
may not necessarily even be on
GitHub. You know, like you could

463
00:29:17,384 --> 00:29:20,528
be, you could be a part of their
discord and you could be like

464
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:23,558
moderating their discord and
something like that, you know,

465
00:29:23,648 --> 00:29:26,648
like that's still contr, um,
contributing, you know what I

466
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:32,239
mean? So, I just, I guess I just
wanted to, to, to, to, again,

467
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:36,558
reemphasize that there's a lot of
things that you can do to

468
00:29:36,564 --> 00:29:40,909
contribute to community. You
know, like it's, again, it's not

469
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:44,739
just writing. I want to say
JavaScripts of that. it's not

470
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:47,778
just writing JavaScript, you know
what I mean? It's just not

471
00:29:47,808 --> 00:29:51,949
writing code. Like there's a lot
of ways you can, you can

472
00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:56,584
contribute and. Keeping that open
mind of the, the, the, you know,

473
00:29:56,733 --> 00:30:01,094
the, the needs of the, the, the
maintainer. That's pretty much

474
00:30:01,094 --> 00:30:01,294
it.

475
00:30:01,443 --> 00:30:05,163
Dan: Yeah, I love that. You know,
and, and Virtual Coffee for

476
00:30:05,163 --> 00:30:08,344
example, right. We have lots of
volunteers that are, that help

477
00:30:08,344 --> 00:30:11,733
our community. Um, but also like
our, our site is open source and.

478
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:14,884
I don't know, like 80% of the
files are just content, you know,

479
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:19,114
they're just, uh, and it, I
suppose it's code technically or

480
00:30:19,114 --> 00:30:21,663
something, you know, but it's
like the, the valuable parts of

481
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:25,683
it are the, are the words, right.
Other content, you know? And, um,

482
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:28,953
I, I mean, I love that advice. I
think it's great and very

483
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,933
important to keep your mind. And
also it's like sometimes,

484
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:33,963
especially when you get into docs
and stuff like that is sometimes

485
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:38,074
really hard for maintainers to
keep up to date or to make, you

486
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:41,824
know, Uh, like to catch all the
edge cases, uh, things like that.

487
00:30:41,854 --> 00:30:45,094
Um, IU from Virtual Coffee is
really good at this sheet. You

488
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:48,243
know, how many times have you
done, like some install followed

489
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:50,884
the, read me, right. Done some
install thing and it didn't work.

490
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:53,733
And you had to like Google around
and try a couple different things

491
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:56,554
to get something to work. Right.
And then what I do most of the

492
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,983
time is just, okay, cool. I got
working. I'll just move on. You

493
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:01,923
know, but how Val, how much,
like, it would be a very easy and

494
00:31:01,923 --> 00:31:06,993
valuable contribution to that,
that project to just go back. Add

495
00:31:07,054 --> 00:31:09,574
like a, a poll request that just
adds a little note in the read me

496
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:12,453
that says, Hey, if you run into
this error, try this fix, you

497
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:16,413
know what I mean? Um, and, uh, I
think that's the kind of thing

498
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:19,983
that a lot of people maybe don't
consider right away. Um, but it,

499
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:20,794
I

500
00:31:20,808 --> 00:31:23,058
Bekah: Kinda like that error that
I have running the Virtual Coffee

501
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:25,098
site that I still haven't. done
anything

502
00:31:25,413 --> 00:31:27,064
Dan: right. Well, that's a whole
different yeah.

503
00:31:27,378 --> 00:31:28,939
Bekah: no, that's a Netlify CLI

504
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:32,044
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. But, but, but it
is the same thing. I mean, like

505
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:35,433
it's, it's the same thing. Like,
okay. Maybe that is something we

506
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:38,013
need to add. Cuz other people,
most people don't have the LF I

507
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:42,423
CLI installed, like to start and,
but you already did. And so

508
00:31:42,423 --> 00:31:46,354
there's something going on and
maybe there's some note we need

509
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:49,564
to add or some parameter to add
to the install steps, you know, I

510
00:31:49,564 --> 00:31:51,723
don't know. I don't know what it
is, but like even just bringing

511
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:54,273
it up in issue, like even
honestly writing an issue is

512
00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:58,084
contributing to an open source.
Like not fixing it, not, not

513
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:02,929
knowing the solution, but just
like logging a problem. It can be

514
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:06,108
a very valuable contribution to
an open source project because,

515
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,138
uh, most likely the maintainer
doesn't know about it. You know,

516
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:13,759
our maintainers don't know about
it, like the, uh, or they do and

517
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:20,209
they forgot or you know,
anything. Uh, and I, I, I, uh,

518
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:22,548
yeah, I don't know. I, I think
everything you said is, is right

519
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:26,689
and I, I think it's great. Um, I
love that also. I just talk a

520
00:32:26,689 --> 00:32:30,078
little bit more. I love that idea
about, um, helping, helping, um,

521
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:33,618
Maintainers in areas outside of
CA hub even, and how valuable

522
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,398
that can be. Um, I think, I think
that's another thing that people

523
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:40,128
don't maybe always think about,
but asking maintainers, if they

524
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:44,388
need help outside of writing
code, uh, it can be nice and it

525
00:32:44,388 --> 00:32:47,179
can be nice, nice to like, have
somebody to reach out, reach out

526
00:32:47,183 --> 00:32:50,269
to you too, you know, sometimes
say, Hey, do you need any help

527
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:52,548
with this? Even if, uh, even if
they say no, it's, it's like a

528
00:32:52,548 --> 00:32:54,798
nice, I don't know, nice gesture.

529
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:55,894
Bekah: Yeah, I,

530
00:32:56,443 --> 00:32:56,923
Chad: Oh, go ahead. Go

531
00:32:57,034 --> 00:33:00,183
Bekah: sorry. I, I gave a talk
on, um, I think it was called, do

532
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:03,604
you need community? And it was
from the perspective of, uh, if

533
00:33:03,604 --> 00:33:07,354
you are maybe getting into code
or if you are in tech and you

534
00:33:07,354 --> 00:33:10,864
don't have a community. What
would be the reasons and the

535
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:14,223
benefits. And part of that, I
talked about getting involved in

536
00:33:14,223 --> 00:33:17,703
organizations and sometimes
people say like, Hey, do you need

537
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:20,374
any help? And there's so much
overwhelmed sometimes as a

538
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:22,683
maintainer that it's like, yeah,
but I don't even know where to

539
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:26,673
start. Right. And so being more
specific like, Hey, do you need

540
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:29,253
any help? I'm really good at
building chat bots. And I think

541
00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:32,104
this could be really beneficial,
like giving that specific thing

542
00:33:32,104 --> 00:33:37,298
or, Hey, Like to post on social
media. Can I write some tweets

543
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:41,288
for you? And you know, you're not
getting a green box for that. And

544
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:45,098
I know that it can be really hard
to feel like, oh, there, I

545
00:33:45,098 --> 00:33:47,739
haven't accomplished anything,
but you've supported a community

546
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:51,608
of people that, that is
supporting other people. So, and

547
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:54,999
I, I think the. One of the things
I like too about Virtual Coffee,

548
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:58,838
our members page just keeps
evolving into something better

549
00:33:58,838 --> 00:34:02,499
and better because we have our
members who have to create a pool

550
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:07,209
request to get their profile on
our me members page. But then

551
00:34:07,568 --> 00:34:12,759
last year, the issue was you can
add your social links, um, and

552
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,478
we've updated it with all of our
active volunteers. So, you know,

553
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:20,943
like finding ways to also.
Support the people who are

554
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:24,094
supporting your project in other
ways is incredibly important as

555
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:24,483
well.

556
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:29,938
Chad: I agree. I agree. And, uh,
I also want to kind of reiterate

557
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:34,588
that, like, you know, you, you,
for, for the people who are

558
00:34:34,588 --> 00:34:38,429
actually contributing code, they,
a lot of those people do that to

559
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:41,909
improve their skills, right. To
come across problems that they

560
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:44,608
generally wouldn't come across or
be more difficult for them to

561
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:51,873
come across. On their own. Right.
But I think the most important

562
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:57,934
part of open source as a
contributor is to, is that

563
00:34:57,934 --> 00:35:01,744
interaction, the interaction with
people, you know what I mean? And

564
00:35:01,748 --> 00:35:05,434
so definitely being, having
something where it's like, okay,

565
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:08,373
you reach out to the maintainers.
It's like, Hey, I can do this.

566
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:11,344
You know, like you were saying,
you know, I can, I can do tweets

567
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:16,099
and so on and so forth. That
interaction is so valuable. And

568
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:20,958
the con that consistency of
interaction is so valuable. Like,

569
00:35:21,168 --> 00:35:23,958
you'd be surprised you'd be,
you'd be maintaining a project

570
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:26,539
and there's just somebody who,
you know, you, you know them, you

571
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:30,893
know, them casually and then they
turn out to be well, 50% of the

572
00:35:30,893 --> 00:35:35,333
time they turn on to be, you
know, your, your next employer,

573
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,123
because they're now op offering
you an opportunity. Uh, I was

574
00:35:38,123 --> 00:35:41,184
watching a video recently, you
know, I'm just going to be, I was

575
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:46,284
watching a video from recently
where I don't remember who he

576
00:35:46,284 --> 00:35:51,923
was, who Brian was talking to,
but he was talking about, um, how

577
00:35:51,923 --> 00:35:56,603
we had an open source project and
like, it became more and more of.

578
00:35:57,844 --> 00:36:01,414
Overall. I don't remember exactly
the, the, the circumstances, but

579
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:05,673
he, and he started hiring a lot
of people because he had somebody

580
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:08,224
who was, he had started hiring.
Not a lot of people. He started

581
00:36:08,224 --> 00:36:12,603
hiring from his contributors
because his contributors were

582
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:15,903
very consistent. They were
excellent, you know, in what the,

583
00:36:15,903 --> 00:36:18,903
in their contributions. And he
just, he was just like, Hey, you

584
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:21,153
want to, you want a full time
job? And they were like, yeah,

585
00:36:21,153 --> 00:36:26,599
sure. And that's how they found
their next opportu. You know, and

586
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:32,119
so. It's really about those
relationships, you know, as a

587
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:35,268
contributor, as a, as a
maintainer, you know, like that's

588
00:36:35,268 --> 00:36:38,329
a, I don't want to talk about
that too much cause that's just

589
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:41,659
not, I don't have the experience
there, but as a contributor, it's

590
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:45,259
about building those
relationships and like it's just

591
00:36:45,259 --> 00:36:49,809
a different avenue. Of, of
building those relationships with

592
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:53,228
people and then, you know,
showing that, you know, like, I

593
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:56,588
guess going back to, to coding,
showing that, you know, you can

594
00:36:56,588 --> 00:37:00,039
code, that's like one of the big
issues, the big problems with,

595
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:03,878
with junior developers trying to
get positions is that effectively

596
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:06,849
they have to prove that they,
they know how to code and they

597
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,998
can just be like, Hey, look at my
contribution to this open source

598
00:37:09,998 --> 00:37:13,119
project that got, you know, that
got merged and is being used in

599
00:37:13,123 --> 00:37:16,864
the project right now and has my
name. You know, I can code, you

600
00:37:16,864 --> 00:37:23,103
know what I mean? Like, so like,
it's just, yeah, it's just, it's

601
00:37:23,103 --> 00:37:25,143
about building those
relationships. Those

602
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:30,634
relationships will, will
definitely take you far. At least

603
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:33,753
in my, in my opinion, that's like
one of the biggest things for,

604
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:33,903
for.

605
00:37:34,324 --> 00:37:37,083
Dan: And not just proving you can
code, but proving that you have

606
00:37:37,143 --> 00:37:40,443
drive and can operate on your own
and things like that as well. Um,

607
00:37:41,313 --> 00:37:45,273
and you're interested in it and,
you know, I think, I think that,

608
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:51,739
uh, sort of. I don't know, a
full, you know, I don't wanna say

609
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:54,949
like, all the green squares are
green, but like, you know, you

610
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:57,228
know, a full like GitHub profile
where you have a lot of

611
00:37:57,228 --> 00:38:01,309
contributions to some things, um,
can go a really long way, uh, to

612
00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:05,088
showing that, you know, even if
you're not like, right, like you

613
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:08,809
said, like rewriting the react
code base, you know, like it

614
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:11,119
doesn't have to be like that,
obviously, especially when you're

615
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,778
starting out. Um, but just like
connecting with people and, and.

616
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:19,009
Contributing in. I don't know. I,
I, yeah, I agree. It's can be a

617
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:21,259
very valuable tool. Um, open
source contribu.

618
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:26,764
Bekah: I know a woman who really
wanted to work with, um, a pretty

619
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:31,293
notable tech organization, but
their interview process was

620
00:38:31,293 --> 00:38:35,884
notoriously hard and she knew she
would not be able to pass the

621
00:38:35,884 --> 00:38:40,853
interview process. And, you know,
didn't have time to devote hours

622
00:38:41,103 --> 00:38:44,733
and months of her life to
studying for. And so she started

623
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:49,114
contributing to their open source
project and sure enough, she got

624
00:38:49,114 --> 00:38:52,143
hired without having to go
through that interview process

625
00:38:52,143 --> 00:38:54,994
because she was familiar with the
code base. They knew that her

626
00:38:54,994 --> 00:38:59,074
work was good and that she could,
could be a part of the team

627
00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:01,623
because of that community
collaboration that she already

628
00:39:01,623 --> 00:39:05,193
had. So, I mean, not, everybody's
gonna let you, uh, navigate

629
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:08,344
around the interview process, but
it was really, really great

630
00:39:08,344 --> 00:39:12,494
strategy for. You know, not only
learning more yourself, but like

631
00:39:12,494 --> 00:39:16,333
you're saying, finding new
avenues to job opportunities.

632
00:39:17,744 --> 00:39:21,164
Chad: Agreed. Agreed. I actually
was, I don't necessarily have a

633
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:25,034
direct story, but I've definitely
heard of other people. Who've had

634
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:29,623
similar experiences who they,
they contributed to, to large

635
00:39:29,623 --> 00:39:34,184
open source projects for pretty
well known companies and, you

636
00:39:34,184 --> 00:39:37,818
know, no interview processes
like. We see that you're we see

637
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:40,909
that you can code, we, you know,
we want you to work on this

638
00:39:40,909 --> 00:39:44,418
thing, you know, so they just
brought them on board, you know,

639
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:47,688
it wasn't that it wasn't a big,
crazy thing, you know, they

640
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:51,528
didn't have to study for, for,
for months, like you said, you

641
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:56,809
know? Definitely like, and from
my understanding, that is, that

642
00:39:56,809 --> 00:40:03,289
is not uncommon, you know, like
it's not an uncommon circum. At

643
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:07,818
all, you know, so definitely I
definitely, again, you know, it's

644
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:11,719
about those relationships. It's
about, you know, it's about

645
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,259
building those relationships
with, with, with those, with

646
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:19,369
those people, you know, and even
with other contributors as well,

647
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:23,778
you know, like how, how many
people have, have kind of come,

648
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:26,688
come to Virtual Coffee and have
become friends with each other.

649
00:40:27,173 --> 00:40:31,509
because of kind of their, their,
their meeting at Virtual Coffee

650
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:34,989
or doing work with Virtual
Coffee. You know what I mean? So

651
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:38,739
it's definitely about building
those relationships again, in my

652
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:39,068
opinion.

653
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:41,929
Bekah: Well, and I think too, one
of the great things about

654
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:44,599
contributing to open source is
also learning how to take

655
00:40:44,603 --> 00:40:48,708
feedback because oftentimes, you
know, you've got a PR and it's

656
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:51,259
not going to be perfect. So
you'll be getting some feedback.

657
00:40:51,528 --> 00:40:54,289
Do you have any experience with
that? And, you know, like, has

658
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:57,108
that helped you develop. As a
developer

659
00:40:58,233 --> 00:41:01,353
Chad: Uh, it has definitely not
helped me develop as a developer

660
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:05,103
because that'd be no, I'm just
uh, yeah, I've gotten, I've

661
00:41:05,103 --> 00:41:09,543
definitely gotten feedback. Um,
Like one of the kind of key

662
00:41:09,543 --> 00:41:12,873
things about just being
coachable, you know? And again,

663
00:41:12,963 --> 00:41:18,934
like, because it's a learning
experience, you know, like, I

664
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:22,804
don't wanna say, well, because
it's a learning experience. You

665
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:26,673
should really be happy for
feedback. You know? Like you

666
00:41:26,673 --> 00:41:28,923
don't want somebody to be giving
you feedback where they're like,

667
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:32,134
ha ha you know, and they're just
kind of yelling down. Like nobody

668
00:41:32,134 --> 00:41:35,403
wants that. You know what I mean?
But if it's like, Hey, I would

669
00:41:35,403 --> 00:41:39,963
structure it this way. That's
like the key thing about, you

670
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:44,434
know, contributions, right? Like
about open source, right? Like, I

671
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:47,164
don't wanna say it's judgment
free again, you know, it depends

672
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:52,954
on who's giving you the feedback,
but it's, it's, it's somewhat

673
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:56,523
non-committal in that sense, in a
sense, you know, like you don't

674
00:41:56,554 --> 00:42:00,333
have to give you contribution.
You absolutely don't have to,

675
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:04,384
it's not life or death. You know
what I mean? So a lot of the

676
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:09,423
times. Like, you can give your,
you can give a contribution and

677
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:13,893
they give you feedback. And that
feedback is just gold. You know

678
00:42:13,893 --> 00:42:16,833
what I mean? It's just like,
there's stuff that they talk

679
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:20,914
about that they, that you didn't
know, or even necessarily they

680
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:24,934
give you feedback and you push
back on the feedback and say,

681
00:42:24,934 --> 00:42:28,173
Hey, this is my, this is the
reason why, like all of that,

682
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:31,998
that interaction. Is extremely
important. That's what you're

683
00:42:31,998 --> 00:42:37,608
gonna be doing on the job. You
know, like code review is going

684
00:42:37,608 --> 00:42:41,298
to happen. like, well, I don't
wanna say it's going to happen.

685
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:44,748
There are some companies that
anyways, but like the likelihood

686
00:42:44,748 --> 00:42:49,998
of that is so high, like. That is
just an interaction that you have

687
00:42:49,998 --> 00:42:54,619
to go through, you know, and not
only that, like the amount of

688
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:58,489
information that you can get from
somebody saying, you know, I

689
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:01,219
don't think this is the best way
of doing it. I think this is a

690
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:08,179
better way is this is like,
especially when. It's it can

691
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:12,498
potentially be difficult or just
hard to, to, to, to get

692
00:43:12,498 --> 00:43:15,559
information and to be able to
leverage it immediately. Like,

693
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:18,978
you know, you can go to a
tutorial and you can learn a

694
00:43:18,978 --> 00:43:22,458
bunch of things, but a lot of the
times, if it doesn't apply to

695
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:26,179
whatever you're doing right now,
you know, it doesn't stick unless

696
00:43:26,184 --> 00:43:31,128
you keep doing it over and over.
But like getting that feedback.

697
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:34,804
You know, on something that
you're working on and then

698
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:38,914
leveraging it and then, you know,
like saying, okay, I've applied

699
00:43:38,914 --> 00:43:41,853
it or I don't, I don't
necessarily agree with your

700
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:45,903
feedback. Like that is such an
important thing. Even if you

701
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:48,634
don't agree with it, it might be
something, whereas, you know,

702
00:43:48,634 --> 00:43:51,123
might be another tool in your
toolbox. You know what I mean?

703
00:43:51,123 --> 00:43:57,378
So, It's it's kind, it's still
kind of sticky because again, you

704
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,958
know, some people are a little
bit more harsh with their

705
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:03,259
feedback or it's not even
necessarily harsh, but their

706
00:44:03,259 --> 00:44:08,539
feedback doesn't kind of mesh
with how your culturally kind of

707
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:13,878
built to accept feedback, you
know, but like for the most part,

708
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:17,509
All of that stuff can potentially
be gold to you, especially as a,

709
00:44:17,778 --> 00:44:21,528
as a new person, still learning,
you know, if like them telling

710
00:44:21,528 --> 00:44:24,168
you, Hey, I don't think this is
necessarily the best way, you

711
00:44:24,168 --> 00:44:28,684
know? All of that is great stuff.
You know, that stuff that you

712
00:44:28,684 --> 00:44:32,943
can, you can put, you can put
away and then like potentially

713
00:44:32,943 --> 00:44:36,273
work on later. Like even if say
your contribution doesn't get

714
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:40,054
accepted for whatever reason, you
know, like that information for

715
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:44,463
you is really, really good when
you're learning, you know? And it

716
00:44:44,463 --> 00:44:48,454
really just kind like, I would
say in terms of navigating code

717
00:44:48,514 --> 00:44:52,773
code, uh, I don't wanna say well
getting feedback. It really just

718
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:56,789
kinda understanding. The person
and how they're giving feedback.

719
00:44:57,148 --> 00:45:01,318
And if they're giving like
feedback that is not particularly

720
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:04,949
great or is demeaning, you know,
let's get up and walk away again,

721
00:45:05,128 --> 00:45:08,668
you're not committed, you know,
like if they're going to be that

722
00:45:08,668 --> 00:45:11,699
person, you know, that's not
somebody you want to be

723
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:16,534
associated with. In any form of
kind of long term anything, you

724
00:45:16,534 --> 00:45:19,864
know, but generally like, you
know, people are very friendly.

725
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:22,474
Like people want you to come
back. Like some people

726
00:45:22,474 --> 00:45:25,023
desperately want you to come
back. You know, it's like, you

727
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:28,503
know, I'm working on this by
myself or I'm working on this

728
00:45:28,503 --> 00:45:31,773
with a small group of people, you
know, more people who are working

729
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:34,773
with me, you know, the better,
you know what I mean? So it's in

730
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:41,298
their it's, they're incentivized
to. To, to kind of keep you

731
00:45:41,298 --> 00:45:45,289
coming back, you know what I
mean? That's and there's also

732
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:48,708
like, this is a part of, kind of
the community aspect of, of open

733
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:52,759
source or a particular open
source project, like how to kind

734
00:45:52,759 --> 00:46:00,168
of contribute and like having a,
having a system kind of around

735
00:46:00,168 --> 00:46:04,893
contribution in the sense of, you
know, code style, you know, Tools

736
00:46:04,893 --> 00:46:08,134
that you, you, you are using and
stuff like that, being very

737
00:46:08,134 --> 00:46:13,083
structured in that way, it really
kind of lets people know how to,

738
00:46:13,594 --> 00:46:17,583
how to approach the project. You
know what I mean? So that's also

739
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:21,634
a good thing to kind of look for.
It doesn't necessarily, it

740
00:46:21,634 --> 00:46:24,813
doesn't necessarily address
feedback directly, you know, but

741
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:28,114
it kind of addressed what, what
your expectations of the feedback

742
00:46:28,114 --> 00:46:32,704
will, will, will be, you know,
but yeah. I

743
00:46:32,898 --> 00:46:36,648
Dan: So as a, as a contributor,
like a potential contributor to a

744
00:46:36,648 --> 00:46:39,108
project, what, what are your
steps? Like, what do you do

745
00:46:39,108 --> 00:46:43,998
before, uh, before you like file
a poll request? Like, what do you

746
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:46,728
like, I assume you maybe read the
readme. What, what, what other

747
00:46:46,728 --> 00:46:50,784
kinda steps do you take? Like to
make sure that you're. Doing what

748
00:46:50,784 --> 00:46:52,563
the maintainers want you to do,
uh, you know,

749
00:46:53,253 --> 00:46:57,184
Chad: To be fair. So I've mostly
been working with open source and

750
00:46:57,184 --> 00:47:01,233
they've had, they have a very
good, you know, kind contributors

751
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:06,603
doc, you know? And so they kind
of put the systems in place so

752
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:10,204
that you don't necessarily, so
that you don't mess up, you know,

753
00:47:10,264 --> 00:47:13,293
in a sense, right. So there's
like a lot of kind of guardrails

754
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:17,884
and handholding that the, that
the system will do, you know, but

755
00:47:18,244 --> 00:47:22,083
like, Again, you know, you can
say for instance, there isn't

756
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:28,023
really any Contra, uh, any. Docs
on contributing generally. That's

757
00:47:28,023 --> 00:47:31,173
the first place you start, you
know, docs on contribute just

758
00:47:31,173 --> 00:47:35,313
the, the, the kind docs on the
infrastructure, right? Like on

759
00:47:35,494 --> 00:47:39,333
how you contribute. Just start
there, you know, before, before

760
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:42,603
anything else, because, uh, a
good, well maintained open source

761
00:47:42,603 --> 00:47:46,668
project will at least have docs
docs to, to tell you. How to

762
00:47:46,673 --> 00:47:49,699
contribute if they don't
necessarily have docs, you may,

763
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:53,119
you know, may reach out to the
maintainer and ask questions. You

764
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,599
may file an issue, ask questions
by the way, if they don't have

765
00:47:56,869 --> 00:48:01,699
docs on contributing, that's a
really good contribution. you

766
00:48:01,704 --> 00:48:06,978
know, like, but. It's just really
just getting clarification, how

767
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:09,378
however you can, like, that
doesn't necessarily mean you

768
00:48:09,378 --> 00:48:12,978
don't, you can't just work on
the, on the poll request

769
00:48:12,983 --> 00:48:16,849
immediately, but you know, like
just getting clarification on how

770
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:21,349
they kind of want the, the poll
request set up, like, and like I

771
00:48:21,353 --> 00:48:24,318
said, get that clarification.
However you can either they have

772
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:29,043
dots written or. Reach out to
people directly, you know, you

773
00:48:29,043 --> 00:48:32,523
may even kind of go back to, to,
to previous pull requests and,

774
00:48:32,793 --> 00:48:36,543
and take a look at that. But I
would definitely say if they

775
00:48:36,543 --> 00:48:40,023
don't have docs, just reach out
to the maintainer and, and start

776
00:48:40,023 --> 00:48:44,043
there. Um, I don't have the most
amount of experience here

777
00:48:44,043 --> 00:48:47,704
because. You know, like my open
source, the project that I work

778
00:48:47,704 --> 00:48:52,414
with, mostly have a lot of these
kind of things in place, but, you

779
00:48:52,414 --> 00:48:54,393
know, just getting that
clarification, like that's,

780
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:56,074
that's the best way I would
submit them. Just get that

781
00:48:56,074 --> 00:49:00,813
clarification first, because it
would kind, it would kind of suck

782
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:03,423
where you do all of this work. It
may even take you like a couple

783
00:49:03,423 --> 00:49:06,123
of days, you do all of this work
and then you make a poll request

784
00:49:06,423 --> 00:49:10,324
and then they, they, they, they
deny the poll request for

785
00:49:10,324 --> 00:49:13,474
something simple that you could
have easily sorted out day one,

786
00:49:13,923 --> 00:49:17,628
you know? And, you know, nobody
wants their full request,

787
00:49:17,628 --> 00:49:20,778
rejected, you know what I mean?
So it's like, it it's just like

788
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:23,059
at the bar least you can just do
those things if you don't, if

789
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:26,358
you're not necessarily a hundred
percent clear, you know,

790
00:49:27,693 --> 00:49:32,134
Bekah: I love that. And I mean,
so you've said you contribute to

791
00:49:32,134 --> 00:49:34,864
opensource and they've got a
great process. So if you wanna

792
00:49:34,864 --> 00:49:37,384
get started and you wanna know
what a good project looks like,

793
00:49:37,384 --> 00:49:40,684
so you can identify other ones,
then go to opensource and look at

794
00:49:40,893 --> 00:49:44,239
what they have there, because.
That's a good way to start. And I

795
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:47,599
know, you know, we've got a
pretty thorough, uh, contributing

796
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,438
guidelines doc on our Virtual
Coffee site as well. And you

797
00:49:51,438 --> 00:49:53,568
know, sometimes there's
discussions, not everybody has

798
00:49:53,568 --> 00:49:57,139
discussions enabled, but I really
like discussions for being able

799
00:49:57,139 --> 00:50:00,378
to have community members ask
questions about things and to

800
00:50:00,384 --> 00:50:03,978
learn more. And then also
discussions allows us to see,

801
00:50:04,188 --> 00:50:07,429
okay, yeah, maybe we're missing
something here or we could add

802
00:50:07,429 --> 00:50:10,554
this now here's an issue. Hey,
since you brought it up, do you

803
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:14,693
want to be the one to make the
pool request, um, for that

804
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:19,673
project? So it is, it is step one
is, well, maybe it's not step

805
00:50:19,673 --> 00:50:23,333
one, but a good step is
identifying what good projects

806
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:26,693
look like. So you can see them
other places

807
00:50:27,768 --> 00:50:28,548
Chad: definitely agree.

808
00:50:29,184 --> 00:50:32,764
Bekah: I kind of wanna pivot a
little bit before we end the

809
00:50:32,793 --> 00:50:35,974
podcast episode and talk more
about Tech is Hiring because you

810
00:50:35,974 --> 00:50:38,583
know, all the things that we've
talked about along with open

811
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:42,184
source, I think contribute to
this idea of Tech is Hiring the

812
00:50:42,184 --> 00:50:47,523
idea of community, of connection,
of navigating through a problem

813
00:50:47,528 --> 00:50:52,833
that you identified. So what kind
of started your inspiration for

814
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:53,704
Tech is Hiring.

815
00:50:54,893 --> 00:51:00,114
Chad: Well, it started really
with my own job search. Um, I, I

816
00:51:00,114 --> 00:51:03,204
don't even know how I came across
this, but I realized that, you

817
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:05,844
know, you could just make a tweet
and say, Hey, I'm looking for a

818
00:51:05,844 --> 00:51:09,204
role. And people retweeted, like
people are very, at the very

819
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:12,963
least in, in the tech industry,
uh, or on tech, Twitter, people

820
00:51:13,074 --> 00:51:19,518
are very open about you. Helping
people find new roles. And so,

821
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:22,849
you know, I was doing that a few
times, like in my own job search.

822
00:51:23,148 --> 00:51:26,268
And then I think one day I was
retweeting and I was just

823
00:51:26,268 --> 00:51:30,498
realized, you know, if you don't
have a good network and yeah, if

824
00:51:30,498 --> 00:51:33,798
you don't have a good network,
you know, L likelihood of you,

825
00:51:33,878 --> 00:51:39,333
you, um, The likelihood of your
tweet going viral in a sense, it,

826
00:51:39,393 --> 00:51:43,833
that would help you is, is, is
pretty low. And so, you know, my

827
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:46,384
first thought was like, Hey, do
we have like a hashtag or

828
00:51:46,384 --> 00:51:52,143
something that we can, you know,
that we can, um, like post our

829
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:54,963
tweet to. So at the very least,
you know, it's in one centralized

830
00:51:54,963 --> 00:51:58,759
place and people are like, no,
and I was just. Okay. And

831
00:51:58,759 --> 00:52:01,188
somebody had reached out and they
were little like, oh, so you're

832
00:52:01,188 --> 00:52:03,619
gonna make a hashtag. Right. And
I was like, I guess I am now. So

833
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:09,498
ended up like taking a yeah.
Ended up taking like a couple of

834
00:52:09,498 --> 00:52:13,159
days, just kind of trying to come
up with a name. And then, you

835
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:16,458
know, I just made a quick post
and I was just like, Hey, this

836
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:20,239
hashtag, you know, post to it. If
you, if you wanted to, if you

837
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:25,773
want to, to, to, to share your
tweet and. Like I pretty much did

838
00:52:25,773 --> 00:52:30,574
that. And initially when I, when
I made the first tweet, I didn't,

839
00:52:30,574 --> 00:52:35,193
I obviously didn't expect anybody
to like be jumping, you know, out

840
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:38,344
to the woodwork to kind of tweet
to it. So I just went out my way

841
00:52:38,349 --> 00:52:42,648
to go find tweets. You know, so
for people to share, to just kind

842
00:52:42,653 --> 00:52:46,998
of encourage and to build that
kind of backlog right. Of places

843
00:52:47,028 --> 00:52:51,199
of, of, of resources and, you
know, it just kind of grew from

844
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:56,719
there. So like, uh, I started
adding tweets every day, you

845
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:00,108
know, every weekday I should say,
I started adding tweets every

846
00:53:00,108 --> 00:53:02,869
day, you know, just took, took a
couple of minutes onto my day. In

847
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:05,088
fact, I'm probably gonna do that
right after I get off of this,

848
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:10,338
but, uh, took a couple of
minutes. Went through all, you

849
00:53:10,338 --> 00:53:14,659
know, went and looked for, for
people looking for jobs or had

850
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:17,358
jobs to share. And I would just
ask them if I could add it to

851
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:21,739
Tech is Hiring and I've just been
doing that. And, you know, at the

852
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:26,478
end of last year, I started doing
spaces around, around Tech is

853
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:29,958
Hiring. When, when spaces, you
know, became a feature that was

854
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:35,298
open to the public, I started
doing that. Um, and. There's a,

855
00:53:35,304 --> 00:53:38,728
there's definitely a lot of
people who just kind of like,

856
00:53:39,028 --> 00:53:42,239
there's a lot of, kind of, I
don't wanna say there's a lot of

857
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:46,079
information that people tend to
lack, you know, like even,

858
00:53:46,168 --> 00:53:49,409
especially there's a lot of job
changes, right? So they may have

859
00:53:49,414 --> 00:53:54,418
existed in an industry for
periods of time, maybe years,

860
00:53:54,418 --> 00:53:57,719
decades. Right. And they're
transitioning into the tech

861
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:02,338
industry and like a simple thing
as how to structure your resume.

862
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:06,289
Is is something that they may not
necessarily know. You know what I

863
00:54:06,295 --> 00:54:09,918
mean? And it's actually fairly
difficult. It's not as difficult

864
00:54:09,918 --> 00:54:13,278
now because there's significantly
more resources, but it's fairly

865
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:17,268
different, difficult to find out
how to structure your resume in a

866
00:54:17,268 --> 00:54:21,739
good way. And so, you know, I was
just like, you know, that's also

867
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:26,764
resources that people could have,
you know, People have, you know,

868
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:30,213
hiring or just kind of job search
or just those kind of

869
00:54:30,213 --> 00:54:35,583
conversations on, on spaces. And
I'll share that, you know, when,

870
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:38,103
whenever I can, it's like, Hey
mind if I add this to tech to

871
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:42,244
hiring, you know, and I guess it
just kind of evolved from there.

872
00:54:42,244 --> 00:54:46,083
I eventually started a newsletter
to kind of do the same thing,

873
00:54:46,414 --> 00:54:50,103
whereas like I have I'll
effectively curate the tweets

874
00:54:50,103 --> 00:54:56,778
that I see. And then I'll. Take
five of the five people. Who were

875
00:54:56,778 --> 00:55:01,429
looking for jobs and then 10 jobs
during that week, and then any

876
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:05,389
additional, like additional
information, like, say for

877
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:08,148
instance, there was like a really
good thread about, you know,

878
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:13,128
again, let's keep it in context.
Um, talking about resume. You

879
00:55:13,128 --> 00:55:16,548
know, like I'll, I'll, I'll share
that anything that's a part of

880
00:55:16,548 --> 00:55:20,719
the hashtag I won't like go
searching for stuff, but anything

881
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:23,539
that's a part of the hashtag, you
know, that got retweeted by with

882
00:55:23,543 --> 00:55:27,378
the hashtag I'll, I'll add that
to the newsletter and so on and

883
00:55:27,378 --> 00:55:32,119
so forth. And, you know, it's
really just kind of been about.

884
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:37,773
Just trying to be like, uh, make
it, make that, make the whole

885
00:55:37,773 --> 00:55:41,704
thing about either job searching
or transitioning, just job

886
00:55:41,704 --> 00:55:47,253
related stuff, make it easier,
you know, especially, um, so like

887
00:55:47,259 --> 00:55:52,579
the, the, the thing about Twitter
is like, When you go on LinkedIn

888
00:55:52,608 --> 00:55:57,289
or when you apply for a job in
any, in any, in any, I guess,

889
00:55:57,318 --> 00:56:02,358
standard way, right? You, you
upload your, your, your resume

890
00:56:02,364 --> 00:56:05,719
and so on and so forth. It's very
likely that you won't necessarily

891
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:08,358
get seen by a human for whatever
reason. I'm not even gonna get

892
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:10,969
into that. But for whatever
reason, you may not necessarily

893
00:56:10,974 --> 00:56:14,929
get seen by a human, you know, or
I don't wanna say that. Uh, for

894
00:56:14,929 --> 00:56:17,719
whatever reason, you won't
interact with a human, I should.

895
00:56:18,123 --> 00:56:21,333
You know, you may get some
automated email saying you were

896
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:26,884
rejected or you may not even get
to reply at all. Right. But you

897
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:30,994
know, for Tech is Hiring because
most of the times I'm retweeting

898
00:56:30,994 --> 00:56:34,684
tweets that somebody else made,
you know, a lot of the times that

899
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:37,925
person, and a lot of the times
it's a person. This is a

900
00:56:38,014 --> 00:56:42,244
legitimate person. That person is
no kind of your, your

901
00:56:42,244 --> 00:56:46,563
interaction, your point of
contact. For that company. So say

902
00:56:46,563 --> 00:56:49,563
for instance, let's, let's go
with AWS. A lot of people

903
00:56:49,563 --> 00:56:52,204
actually, when they, when
they're, when they're sharing

904
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:55,414
jobs, they'll say, Hey, you know,
like it's in particular cases,

905
00:56:55,414 --> 00:57:00,153
they'll say I'll, I'll definitely
not, what's not sponsors the

906
00:57:00,273 --> 00:57:04,369
what's the phrase. When they,
they recommend you, they they'll

907
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:10,219
recommend you, you know? And so
you have that, excuse me, you

908
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:15,648
have that, um, point of contact
with the organization, you know,

909
00:57:15,648 --> 00:57:20,418
and like, for, for, for getting
hired, like having somebody

910
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:24,164
recommend you, you know,
especially. A big person

911
00:57:24,193 --> 00:57:28,603
recommending you is a huge deal.
You know, and for like,

912
00:57:28,603 --> 00:57:32,293
especially for, for younger
engineers, they don't necessarily

913
00:57:32,293 --> 00:57:35,173
have that network to have
somebody recommend them for a

914
00:57:35,173 --> 00:57:39,673
job. You know what I mean? And
so, you know, when somebody posts

915
00:57:39,673 --> 00:57:43,873
that, you know, their job is
looking for a opposition and

916
00:57:44,304 --> 00:57:47,384
somebody sees that they can go
and just reach out to them, they

917
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:53,028
can send them a DM or they can
send them a reply. And. That,

918
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:57,108
that interaction is significantly
better. That even if you're qual,

919
00:57:57,168 --> 00:57:59,418
I mean, to be fair, if you're
qualified for the job, you're

920
00:57:59,418 --> 00:58:02,869
qualified for the job, but just
having that kind of point of

921
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:05,809
contact, you know, maybe it's not
the job for you, but you don't

922
00:58:05,809 --> 00:58:07,489
know that, you know, you're not
gonna know that until you

923
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:10,728
interview, so you can sit down
and talk with them. You know,

924
00:58:10,733 --> 00:58:15,259
like just having that point of
contact is so important. You

925
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:19,338
know, so like that's kind of, the
real value of Tech is Hiring

926
00:58:19,338 --> 00:58:22,909
currently is, is not even
necessarily the resources that

927
00:58:22,914 --> 00:58:27,858
get shared is the resources and
the people who actually share

928
00:58:27,864 --> 00:58:31,128
them and your ability to interact
with them. You know, that's

929
00:58:31,128 --> 00:58:34,398
really the, the, the main thing
about Tech is Hiring.

930
00:58:35,074 --> 00:58:37,114
