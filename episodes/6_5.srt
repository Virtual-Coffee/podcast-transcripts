Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season 6, Episode 5

2
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:10,691
of the

3
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:13,395
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

4
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:16,099
that

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,821
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

6
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:21,230
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,639
their

8
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:24,248
coding journey. And they're
here, on this podcast, sharing

9
00:00:24,248 --> 00:00:25,850
their

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,140
stories and what they've
learned. And we are here to

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,430
share it with

12
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:30,830
you here with me. Today is my
co-host, Dan.

13
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:39,831
Dan Ott: Waddup, Bek? [Bekah
laughs] How is it going today?

14
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:43,191
Bekah: Just never know-- never
know what-- how you're going to

15
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:49,070
deliver that. It is- is going
amazingly fantastic today.

16
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:53,000
Dan: That is impressive.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,300
Bekah: Yep.

18
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,625
Dan: That's good. Cuz today we
had

19
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,295
an amazingly fantastic guest,
Chad Stewart.

20
00:00:58,731 --> 00:00:59,810
Bekah: Who is also awesome.

21
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:02,000
Dan: He's a software-- he is
also awesome. Yeah. We-- that's

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
obvious because he is on our
podcast. So-

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,200
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,855
Dan: -like, you know, we just
assumed-

25
00:01:04,445 --> 00:01:05,676
Bekah: Yeah. It was implied.

26
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:06,500
Dan: -at this point. Yeah.

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:06,800
Bekah: Yeah.

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,275
Dan: But yeah, he's a-- Chad's a
software

29
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:13,865
engineer from Kingston, Jamaica.
And-- yeah, we had a good time

30
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,135
talking to him. And he talked a
lot about his experience with

31
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:22,700
open source and also his ... I
don't know what you call-

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,135
Bekah: Project?

33
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:25,000
Dan: -he's got a newsletter--
his sort of project. Yeah.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,536
Called Tech

35
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:29,700
is Hiring. And ... I don't know.
He told us a lot about-- a lot

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,305
about that and

37
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:32,585
how- how he got into that. And,
you know, how it works and stuff

38
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:33,066
is- is very cool.

39
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:34,911
Bekah: Yeah. I love how
organically it started. You

40
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:36,066
know,

41
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:40,626
he saw a need for something that
in the wider tech industry. And

42
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:43,715
then somebody mentioned to him
like, "Hey, what do you think

43
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:45,860
about doing something more with
this?" And he just went with

44
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,005
that.

45
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:50,824
And I think that's a really
great way to find inspiration

46
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:52,475
and energy from the things that
you're doing.

47
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,495
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. I mean,
it's always good to talk to

48
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,290
Chad.

49
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,322
He's- he's very funny. He's-
he's one of our main

50
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:01,354
contributors to

51
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:04,000
our humor channel [Bekah and Dan
chuckle] in- in- in our Slack.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,575
And yeah, it- it was

53
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:09,725
fascinating hearing about his-
his experience with all that

54
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:11,705
stuff. And with the- the
OpenSauced. That was the other--

55
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:14,000
that's the big project that he
volunteers with--

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,316
contributes with.

57
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:18,485
And he talked a lot about how
you don't have to be writing

58
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:23,015
code to contribute to an open
source project. And I-- both

59
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:25,000
agree with that [chuckles] very
much and- and appreciate the-

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,366
the way he talked about his
experiences with that.

61
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:31,985
Bekah: Yeah. And we start this
episode of podcast like

62
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,866
we start every Virtual Coffee.
We introduce ourselves with our

63
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:37,776
name, where we're from, what we
do, and a random check-in

64
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:49,097
question. We hope you enjoy this
episode. Our random check-in

65
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:52,787
question is, if you could have
any animal for a pet, what would

66
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:52,997
it be?

67
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:54,187
Chad Stewart: Cheetah.

68
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:56,956
Bekah: [Chuckles] Not yet.

69
00:02:57,676 --> 00:02:57,977
Chad: [Dan laughs] Oh.

70
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:00,887
Bekah: And how is it not a
penguin? That's what I wanna

71
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:01,037
know.

72
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:05,796
Chad: I like cheetahs. It'd be
cheetah or a peregrine falcon.

73
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:07,157
Those are my favorite animals.

74
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:08,602
Dan: Mm.

75
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:10,597
Bekah: All right. My name is
Bekah. I am a technical

76
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:12,592
community

77
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,372
builder from a small town in
Ohio. And if I could have any

78
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:24,382
animal for a pet ... I really
like red pandas and ring-tailed

79
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:29,662
lemurs. So those are on the top
of the list. But a falcon seems

80
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:33,532
like it would be pretty cool.
I've already got a skinny pig.

81
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:37,252
So I feel like half of my dreams
have been fulfilled already.

82
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:41,373
Dan: Yeah, that thing is
horrifying [chuckles].

83
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:42,979
Bekah: No. Cute. It's adorable.

84
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:45,334
Dan: It's not. The-- they're
supposed to have fur [laughs].

85
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:47,000
Bekah: No.

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500
Dan: It's like it has a--
something--

87
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,700
Bekah: It doesn't-- it doesn't
have fur.

88
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,000
Dan: Well, I know it doesn't.

89
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:51,000
Bekah: It's a tiny hippopotamus.
So if you're not-

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,500
Dan: [Chuckles] It's not.

91
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,818
Bekah: -familiar with what a
skinny pig

92
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:56,299
is, it is a hairless Guinea pig
that looks like a tiny hippo.

93
00:03:57,859 --> 00:03:59,700
Super cute. Google it.

94
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,000
Dan: [Laughs] It's- it's--

95
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,000
Bekah: It is so cute, Dan.

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,500
Dan: It's really weird.

97
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,588
Bekah: Stop it. Stop hating on
my pet.

98
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:05,824
Dan: I mean, this is from a
person who likes the hairless

99
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:06,153
cats too. So [unintelligible].

100
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:07,188
Bekah: Love hairless cats.
They're amazing.

101
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:09,183
Dan: They're, like, the most
horrifying thing in the world.

102
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:10,938
Bekah: No, they're not. They're
so great. Especially when

103
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:12,889
they're angry looking, they're
just, like, great.

104
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:22,300
Dan: That ... [laughs] I don't
know. Okay. Hi, I'm Dan. I am a

105
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,814
developer of computer

106
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:31,353
things [laughs]. I live in
Cleveland, Ohio. Yeah. So are we

107
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:33,064
sticking with real world
animals?

108
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,403
Bekah: No. If you want a mini
dragon, you can have one.

109
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:39,783
Dan: A mini dragon? I was gonna
say the dragon guy from "The

110
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:42,274
Neverending Story", although he
is, like, a little--

111
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:43,500
Chad: Falkor?

112
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,264
Bekah: Falkooor.

113
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:48,588
Dan: Yeah, Falkor. I was gonna
say, what's the word

114
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:52,000
for, like, when you-- when a
person, like, a- a being can,

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,238
like, talk, and think, and
stuff?

116
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:55,434
Bekah: An anthropomorphism?

117
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,789
Dan: No, no, no. Like a-- like a
conscious or some- you know,

118
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:00,769
like, he has-- he's a

119
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:04,309
little too much of a human-- not
a human but, like, a thinking

120
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:05,358
thing to be, like, have a pet--

121
00:05:05,374 --> 00:05:07,274
Bekah: Yeah. He's an
anthropomorphized

122
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,000
[unintelligible]--

123
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,978
Dan: I- I know. But I'm saying,
like-- I'm saying, like, since--

124
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:11,869
Chad: It seems it got a taxpayer
to me. To know [inaudible].

125
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:13,500
Dan: [Laughs] It's a word--
there's a word for what I'm

126
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:13,819
looking for.

127
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:16,900
And I- I- I can't think of the
word. But what I mean is, like,

128
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,163
I would

129
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:19,803
feel bad keeping him as a pet
because he has, like, too much

130
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:21,318
of his own, you know,
consciousness. You know what I

131
00:05:21,318 --> 00:05:22,833
mean? Like, he,

132
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:25,504
like, talks and he is, like, his
own thing. So I don't think he'd

133
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:27,454
wanna be a pet. And that would
make me sad.

134
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,598
Bekah: Well, like, what about
dogs that run away all the time?

135
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:31,608
Did they really wanna be pet?
Should they be free too?

136
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:38,700
Dan: I mean ... I don't know
[chuckles]. I mean, that's a

137
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,004
good question.

138
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:42,153
Should any pets be pets, you
know? Yeah. Yeah.

139
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:43,699
Bekah: I-- it's one of those
moral conundrums.

140
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:46,500
Dan: I mean, if you truly love
it, then set it free and it'll-

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,700
Bekah: They comes back? [Laughs]

142
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,994
Dan: -come back or something?
How does that go? [Laughs]

143
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:50,000
Bekah: If they comes back, it's
yours.

144
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,000
Dan: Alright.

145
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,769
Bekah: And that's how you know.

146
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:53,800
That is lyrics in a Christina
Aguilera's song.

147
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,000
Dan: Mm.

148
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,199
Bekah: I refrain from singing it
for you.

149
00:05:57,363 --> 00:06:02,043
Dan: Ah-- oh, man. All right.
Anyway, that's my answer. I'm-

150
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:04,300
I'm going-- i-if we have to
stick with real world, I'd say

151
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:04,613
sloth though.

152
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:06,000
Sloths are really cool. And, you
know-

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,700
Bekah: Oh, yeah.

154
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,983
Dan: -and I'd like-- I'd totally

155
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:09,800
like just chill in the backyard
with the sloth. If it's-

156
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,000
Bekah: I was--

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,437
Dan: -real world-- real world
animal. That's- that's my

158
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:12,874
answer.

159
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:16,352
Bekah: I was in Costa Rica when
I was, like, 19 or 20. And that

160
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:19,153
was a highlight to get-- to see
the three toed and the two toed

161
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:19,483
sloths.

162
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:20,524
Dan: [Whispers] Oh, yeah. Nice.

163
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:23,014
Bekah: Welcome, Chad [chuckles].

164
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:24,423
Dan: [Laughs] Yeah. Go ahead,
Chad.

165
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:28,983
Chad: Oh, yeah. So I-I'm Chad
Stewart. I'm a software

166
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:28,983
engineer in--

167
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:32,524
cu-currently in Kingston,
Jamaica, mostly do front-end

168
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:37,084
engineering stuff. Right now
though, hopefully

169
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:40,264
transitioning to doing more
full-stack stuff. And I guess I

170
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:42,634
answered this earlier, but it
would be either a cheetah or

171
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:46,564
peregrine falcon. Those are my
favorite animals. They're fast.

172
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:51,423
I like fast animals. I don't
know. Yeah. And I like birds

173
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:56,074
which Bekah might have-- Bekah
alluded to earlier

174
00:06:56,074 --> 00:06:58,894
with a different type of bird.
But-- yeah [chuckles].

175
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,738
Dan: [Chuckles] Did you ever
read-- either of you ever read

176
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:04,418
"My Side of the Mountain"?

177
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:05,728
Bekah: Yes.

178
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:06,783
Chad: I- I did not.

179
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,148
Dan: You read that, Chad? So
it's a-- it's like a-- it's like

180
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:09,453
a young

181
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:12,602
adult book, I think. But it--
it's about a kid who runs away,

182
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,148
and goes, and lives in the
woods, like, with- with nothing,

183
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:15,573
you know? And

184
00:07:15,574 --> 00:07:19,144
teaches himself how to so-sort
of forage, and hunt, and fish or

185
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:21,574
whatever. And he eventually,
like, goes and get-- like, st-

186
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,004
steals a

187
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:27,514
falcon baby from a nest and- and
then, like, raises it and trains

188
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:28,519
it. And be-- it becomes his,
like, friend and stuff. It's-

189
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,524
it's

190
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:34,300
really cool. Anyway, that- that
sounds cool. It would be-- it

191
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,788
would be really cool to

192
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,968
have a falcon as- as a pet. And,
like, could just, like, hang

193
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:41,509
out with you on your shoulder?
Is that what-- do you think

194
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:43,098
you'd do shoulder or just do
your arm thing? I dunno if

195
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:44,000
on arm is possible.

196
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:46,264
Chad: Depends on the falcon.
I'm-- you know, considering the

197
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:47,794
talents, it would probably not
necessarily rest on your

198
00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:49,324
shoulder

199
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:50,824
and rest in your shoulder, you
know what I mean?

200
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,158
Dan: [Laughs] Right, right.
[Unintelligible] very little--

201
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,918
Bekah: Like a very leather
shoulder pad or something.

202
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,000
Dan: Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Little contraption for him to

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,024
hang out on. Feel like

204
00:07:58,024 --> 00:07:59,598
you'd wanna, like, hang, you
know? Keep you-- keep him with

205
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:01,172
you when-

206
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:03,274
when he's not-- like, when he's
not cruising around.

207
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:07,488
Bekah: If I am ever famous and I
go to an award show, I'm gonna

208
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:11,569
come with a falcon on my
shoulder. I just decided it.

209
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:11,733
Seems like the [unintelligible].

210
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:12,648
Dan: You're keynoting a
conference. You should do it

211
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:13,563
there.

212
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:17,298
Bekah: [Laughs] I don't think I
have enough time to train a

213
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:18,300
falcon. I've got, like-

214
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:18,500
Dan: Mm.

215
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,759
Bekah: -three weeks.

216
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:21,274
Dan: That's not enough time.

217
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:22,668
Bekah: I don't know.

218
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:25,249
Dan: Well, yeah. This episode
will come out after that anyway.

219
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:29,478
So next time you're the keynote
speaker at a conference,

220
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,000
that'll be-- you just put that
in the-- on the plan [laughs].

221
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,300
Bekah: That'll be my thing.

222
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:34,500
Dan: Yeah.

223
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,083
Bekah: Kirk says my thing is
crying while I give

224
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,203
talks. And that is the thing I
would like to not be doing. I

225
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:43,000
would rather be the- the Falcon
shoulder person [Bekah and Dan

226
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,504
laugh]. Wel- welcome, Chad. This

227
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:54,288
is-- this is the normal intro
for us. And it is a Friday that

228
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:55,700
we are recording on. So-

229
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,300
Dan: Yeah.

230
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,129
Bekah: -brains don't work on
Fridays.

231
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:00,700
Everybody knows that. So
[laughs] you're gonna have to

232
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,879
bear with us today.

233
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:06,108
But we will-- we'll give you the
mic now. So you don't have

234
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:09,349
to listen to me talk anymore. We
always love to hear your origin

235
00:09:09,354 --> 00:09:12,708
story. How did you come into
tech and get to this point in

236
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:13,249
your tech journey?

237
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:19,594
Chad: Yeah. So, I guess I give a
kind of quick synopsis of-

238
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:26,614
of what I did. So, I moved to
the United States for some

239
00:09:26,614 --> 00:09:28,571
time. To be honest, to- to- to
go to art school because I

240
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:30,528
wanted to

241
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,688
be a- a game developer and I--
but I couldn't draw very well at

242
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:34,848
the

243
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:38,599
time. So I ended up into another
program, which effectively was

244
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:42,168
web design. Whatever this-- it
was The Art Institute of Fort

245
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:43,803
Lauderdale. And it was whatever
they had, kinda called web

246
00:09:43,803 --> 00:09:45,438
design.

247
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:49,009
And I did that for some time,
graduated, and then found I

248
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:52,800
didn't necessarily like web
design directly. Or at least,

249
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,479
what it was

250
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:58,698
at the time. And so I ended up
going back to another school.

251
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:01,700
I'm pretty sure the South
Floridians would kind of

252
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,269
know the schools

253
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,389
that I'm talking about. Well,
people know Art Institute. But

254
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,259
for the South Floridians, I went
back to NSU — Nova

255
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,523
Southeastern University — got a-
a software engineering degree

256
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:13,787
from

257
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:19,908
there. And then did some work,
ended up returning home, and

258
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:24,469
have been kinda working around
ever since. During the

259
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:29,734
pandemic, I was unemployed. And
that-- that's how I came across,

260
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:33,932
you know, Bekah, and Dan, and
Virtual Coffee when they were--

261
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,688
when they were hosting-- well,
they're still hosting [laughs].

262
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:37,443
They're still

263
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:41,553
hosting Zoom- Zoom calls. But
that's how I came across them.

264
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:48,423
And I've mostly been kinda
active on Twitter. So I s- I,

265
00:10:48,423 --> 00:10:53,076
you know, I met-- I met Dan and-
a-a-and Bekah during 2020 ...

266
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:59,614
2020, 2021 I decided to start an
organization called

267
00:10:59,614 --> 00:11:04,984
Tech is Hiring. Te- pretty much
what I do is I retweet job

268
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:10,984
opportunities as I come across
them on Twitter. And I re- re-

269
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:15,484
I also retweet people looking
for- for opportunities.

270
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:20,764
And so I've been doing that for
about-- for- for a little bit

271
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:25,500
over a year now. And ... yeah.
Like, that's pretty much it.

272
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:25,923
We- we do have--

273
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:31,563
we have some presence on
LinkedIn, but mostly still on

274
00:11:31,563 --> 00:11:36,274
Twitter. Have a newsletter, been
doing the newsletter thing,

275
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:37,338
haven't missed a week. I'm
actually pretty happy about

276
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:38,402
that [chuckles].

277
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:43,879
Have- have been doing a
newsletter for a couple of

278
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:47,568
months now. I think over six
months now. And ... yeah. That's

279
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:51,769
pretty much-- yeah. I'm working
now, you know, thankfully. And

280
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:56,089
my opportunities are increasing
because of the amount of work

281
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,239
that I've been doing, and people
I've been reaching out to, and

282
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:03,828
so on and so forth. But-- yeah.
Yeah, it's pretty much me right

283
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:04,009
now.

284
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:08,193
Bekah: That's awesome. And we're
gonna dive into Tech is Hiring a

285
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:11,464
little bit more. But before we
jump into that, I know that

286
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,888
you've been doing, you know, a
lot of different community

287
00:12:12,888 --> 00:12:14,312
things

288
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:17,494
and some of that's been open
source work. Do you wanna talk

289
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:21,813
about what you've been doing
with open source and how you've

290
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:22,984
been a contributor as well?

291
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:28,833
Chad: Ah, yes. Ah, yes. So, I
recently started open source--

292
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:33,394
doing more open source work.
Funny enough, I started with

293
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:37,653
the-- with the- the open source
project that I had started with,

294
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:42,874
which is Open Sauced by Brian
Douglas — at Bdougie

295
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:49,024
on- on Twitter. And he,
honestly, he approached me to

296
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:53,793
ask me to- to- to contribute to
his project. And I did.

297
00:12:53,823 --> 00:13:01,234
But I didn't stay initially,
mostly because of just all other

298
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:06,798
stuff that I kinda had going on
at the time. But he, again,

299
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:12,678
approached me later-- he, again,
approached me later that year —

300
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:16,369
really late in the year — mostly
because of Tech is Hiring.

301
00:13:16,668 --> 00:13:19,700
And then he, you know, he wants
to brought-- wanted me to- to

302
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,178
come on-- to-to-to

303
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:26,328
contribute more- more again, and
that's what I've been

304
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:31,249
kinda doing for the last couple
of months. And, you know,

305
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:36,918
his- his project is pretty much
about kind of having-- it- it

306
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:40,668
being a platform of- of people,
you know, transitioning into

307
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:45,558
contributing for open source.
It's in a bit of-- I don't

308
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:51,738
wanna call it limbo, but if the
kinda scope is evolving at

309
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:55,548
this point. So, you know, we're-
we're all just kinda trying to

310
00:13:55,548 --> 00:14:03,318
figure the OT, recently left
GitHub to- to work on- o-on open

311
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:09,129
source full time. And so, you
know, as he does that, and he's

312
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:13,359
putting a lot more, like, of his
full, you know, effort into it,

313
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:15,549
he's been-- he's been kinda
expanding on that. And I've

314
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:17,739
really

315
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:21,038
been helping here and there. So,
like, for instance, one of the

316
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:24,369
things that I did — I'm pretty
kinda happy about this — is

317
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:27,698
that the- the- the onboarding
experience for open source was-

318
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:33,229
was a little bit disjointed and,
you know, he had managed to- to-

319
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:37,249
to get some designs and to just
kinda change the

320
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:40,969
onboarding experience. And that
was, like, one of the first

321
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:44,328
major things that had helped him
with when I started contrib-

322
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:47,687
contributing

323
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:50,148
more often. And, you know, I've
been doing it for-- I've been

324
00:14:50,148 --> 00:14:52,608
working

325
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,599
on the project ever since. It--
there's two projects. There's

326
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:01,009
OpenSauced the- the- the app--
the- the- the regular app. And

327
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:05,089
then you have Hot OpenSauced,
which is like a-a-a-another--

328
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:10,399
not a child app, but just that
a-app alongside of it. I

329
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:12,889
haven't been working with Hot
OpenSauced. But-- yeah. That's

330
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:15,634
pretty much what I've been
doing. And, you know, you

331
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:18,379
interact with

332
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:20,764
the community. You know, you get
to talk to-- you- you- you talk

333
00:15:20,764 --> 00:15:23,149
to

334
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:25,218
people here and there, like--
so, it's kinda interesting

335
00:15:25,218 --> 00:15:27,287
because

336
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:29,448
he has a-- he has a Discord
which I- I interact with a- a

337
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:31,608
few times,

338
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:34,849
but to be honest, a lot of the
interactions kinda come- come

339
00:15:34,849 --> 00:15:38,749
through his stream. I feel like
a lot of people just kinda

340
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:40,203
come there. And then there's
also times where he'll have,

341
00:15:40,203 --> 00:15:41,657
like, a

342
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:45,769
call on his Discord. And, you
know, that's where you- you have

343
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:48,408
some really interesting
conversations, you know, about

344
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:50,013
the project and about kinda how
it's evolving. But just

345
00:15:50,013 --> 00:15:51,618
generally

346
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:55,339
about software engineering. I
think that's, like, in terms of-

347
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,369
of-- in terms of open source,
that's the thing that I kinda

348
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:03,000
want to-- I- I- I really think
is the most important is, you're

349
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,349
kind of

350
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:07,219
access to information that you
wouldn't regularly have or not

351
00:16:07,219 --> 00:16:10,788
even necessarily access. Because
if you've heard these terms,

352
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:14,778
you've heard a lot of the
technologies and stuff, you

353
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:17,629
prob- you can Google it. Or, you
know, they're- they're that

354
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:22,308
open. But, like, the likelihood
of you coming across that as

355
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:25,578
somebody who's just not in the
know, you know, is very

356
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:28,759
difficult. And I think that's,
like, the- the key thing that-

357
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:33,484
that open source has been
helping me with is just coming

358
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:35,794
across these technologies, and
these people, and, you know,

359
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,104
just

360
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:41,524
getting to know them, you know?
Even if it's still more of a

361
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,124
passive la- not passive. But as
a pe- I don't know the person

362
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:47,313
directly or I don't know-- I
haven't interacted with the

363
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:49,863
technology but just having them
as, like, in your Rolodex of

364
00:16:49,863 --> 00:16:52,413
things

365
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:53,853
that you could leverage, you
know, is extraordinarily

366
00:16:53,853 --> 00:16:55,293
important.

367
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:59,433
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. I love
that. And I love Brian Douglas

368
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:02,764
too. He's pretty awesome. I--
actually, he's gonna be doing

369
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:07,263
a Lunch and Learn at Virtual
Coffee, which is super

370
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:11,253
exciting. We're gonna talk about
open source, and OpenSauced,

371
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:13,608
and Hacktoberfest. So that'll be
coming up in September. I'm

372
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:15,963
really glad

373
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:21,588
to have him getting us in the--
in the mind frame of

374
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:24,003
prepping to do some open source
contribution. Because that's--

375
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:26,297
I--

376
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:29,719
the beginning of-- kind of of
the Virtual Coffee origin story

377
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:33,558
maybe. It's not the first thing
that we did, but it

378
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:38,148
was the first time I felt like
Virtual Coffee was gonna be an

379
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:42,888
organization that outlasts the
pandemic. I thought for a

380
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:44,441
long time that it was like,
"Hey, we're gonna get together."

381
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:45,988
And

382
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,074
everybody's feeling isolated.
And then we did Hacktoberfest,

383
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:49,949
our

384
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:51,931
first Hacktoberfest Initiative.
And everybody was just so

385
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:53,909
excited

386
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:55,949
about it and contributing. And
we had maintainers, and

387
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,989
contributors,

388
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:02,314
and lots of mentorship, and
support, and it was, you know,

389
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:02,614
it was fun but

390
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:07,233
really gratifying to see people
contributing, and learning,

391
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:10,023
and growing through that
experience. And, you know, it

392
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:13,173
can be-- it can be scary to get
involved and do your first

393
00:18:13,173 --> 00:18:16,923
contribution, even if you've
been in tech. We had a number of

394
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:19,324
people who have been in tech for
a while and have never done an

395
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:20,976
open source contribution. So,
you know, what advice do you

396
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,624
have for

397
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:26,344
folks who are m-maybe a little
bit nervous about entering that

398
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:27,394
open source experience?

399
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:32,808
Chad: That's a-- that's a really
interesting question.

400
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,743
Hmm. What advice would I give?
So, I would say, find the

401
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:41,567
community,

402
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:48,304
you know? Like, the-- so, the-
the- the open source projects

403
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:54,094
that I would definitely look-
look to are open source

404
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:58,953
projects that are very much not
just about the- the- the

405
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,221
contributions but, you know,
like, the- the-- whatever you

406
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:03,483
kind of

407
00:19:03,513 --> 00:19:07,294
deliver, whatever you merge, you
know? But significantly more

408
00:19:07,294 --> 00:19:12,798
about the community of people.
And just kind of the culture

409
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,909
around the- the- the open source
project. Like-- that's really

410
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:21,469
important, you know? Like, there
are a lot of-- there, you know,

411
00:19:21,469 --> 00:19:24,258
people give the advice of- of,
you know, contribute to, like,

412
00:19:24,258 --> 00:19:27,047
you-

413
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:28,716
you-- their tools that you use
all the time like React, and so

414
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:30,378
on

415
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:34,503
and so forth, you know? You want
to contribute to those. And, you

416
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:37,263
know, some of them are hit and
miss but a lot of the times,

417
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:40,878
they're so big that they--
they're really hard to get into,

418
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:44,493
you

419
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:46,623
know? Like, I- I wanted to-- I,
you know, I heard the- the whole

420
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:48,753
thing.

421
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:49,923
It's like, "You should-- you
should contribute to open

422
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,093
source. It's

423
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:52,744
great." And so, I was just like,
"Okay, I'll contribute to open

424
00:19:52,744 --> 00:19:54,394
source,"

425
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:55,609
you know? "Which- which product
then I'm going to try?" "You

426
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:56,824
wanna try

427
00:19:56,824 --> 00:19:58,518
to contribute to React. There's
a bunch of good first issues

428
00:19:58,518 --> 00:20:00,212
there."

429
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:01,606
And I was just like, "What?"
[Chad and Bekah laugh] You know

430
00:20:01,606 --> 00:20:02,999
what I

431
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,804
mean? Like, I couldn't

432
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,408
understand anything that they
were asking. And this was, like,

433
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:08,012
a

434
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:11,614
couple of years back. And I, you
know, I tried it a few times and

435
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:13,158
I was just like, "I'm gonna go
do something else," you know

436
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:14,702
what I

437
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:17,493
mean? So it's, like, really
important to kinda have that

438
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:19,581
community, like, have- have
those people being very

439
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:21,663
welcoming, you

440
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:23,865
know? Having the Discord. Like,
a lot of the- the secondary

441
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:26,067
stuff to

442
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:31,259
the-- to the-- to the actual
working code and tools is- is

443
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:33,448
really important. The second
thing, and I'm- I'm really

444
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:35,637
happy,

445
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:38,176
I remember this. But- but the
second thing is that do- you

446
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:40,708
don't necessarily

447
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:44,673
have to contribute code, you
know? It's not just about code.

448
00:20:44,673 --> 00:20:46,428
There's a lot of other things
that you can contribute and

449
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:48,183
that

450
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:50,088
would be a contra- contribution
to open source. Like,

451
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:51,993
contributing

452
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:59,824
documentation, you know? Like, I
know Brian have-- for- for open

453
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:02,253
source, he has a triage team
for- for triaging issues. I

454
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:04,682
believe

455
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:09,033
that's like ... you know, f-find
you-- taking-- I'm sorry if

456
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:13,383
I'm-- I-

457
00:21:13,384 --> 00:21:15,303
I- I hope I'm getting this
right. But, like, you- you take

458
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:17,222
it-- when-

459
00:21:17,223 --> 00:21:20,523
when there's issues, you know,
you kinda scope them out so that

460
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:22,368
there's something that somebody
can easily take on. And I

461
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,152
believe

462
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:26,958
he got that idea from the Node--
from Node. Which Node's, from

463
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,763
my

464
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:33,299
understanding-- no, in fact, for
the longest time, I really

465
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:33,693
wanted to join the

466
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:36,063
open source community for Node
because they seemed so

467
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:38,433
welcoming,

468
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:40,863
you know? They seemed to have
all of this kind of

469
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:43,233
infrastructure in

470
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:48,328
place for a new person to come
in and really be able to

471
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:50,473
contribute, you know? Like, I
don't remember exactly

472
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:52,618
everything

473
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:53,833
that they have now but, like,
they have, you know, they have

474
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,048
stuff on

475
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:58,019
YouTube, they have them week--
they have weekly meetings on

476
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:00,328
YouTube, you know? Like, they
have, like, this whole community

477
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:02,637
around

478
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:05,068
joining them. And so-- and--
I'll try not to- to go into the

479
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:07,498
community thing

480
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:09,714
again but, like, there are a lot
of things that you can do to

481
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:11,929
contribute,

482
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:13,488
you know? Like, you can
contribute documentation, like--

483
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:15,047
for- for- for

484
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:16,833
the Node project. Like, I
believe you can do something,

485
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,618
like, just

486
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:21,288
kinda help managing the meetings
that they have because

487
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:23,703
they regularly have meetings.
But there are a lot of outside

488
00:22:23,703 --> 00:22:25,878
things,

489
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:28,188
outside of, like, literally
writing the code that needs to

490
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:30,498
go into

491
00:22:30,503 --> 00:22:35,209
the project that can go-- that
can go in there. And people have

492
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:37,811
literally gotten opportunities
from contributing to open

493
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:40,413
source--

494
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:44,853
open source projects in these
auxiliary ways, you know? And

495
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:47,778
so I would-- so the thing that I
would definitely stress is

496
00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:50,989
community, you know? Like,
community is extraordinarily

497
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:55,219
important, you know? Having
people to have your back, you

498
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:58,578
know, when you're contributing
is really important. To be quite

499
00:22:58,584 --> 00:23:02,628
honest, I would say that it's
much more important to- to- to

500
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:05,358
build and maintain those
relationships than it is to

501
00:23:05,358 --> 00:23:07,211
contribute the code, in my
opinion. But it's much more

502
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:09,064
important

503
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:10,474
to have those relationships. In
fact, I would say that's the

504
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:11,884
most

505
00:23:11,884 --> 00:23:14,344
important thing about open
source. And that it's not just

506
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:16,804
about

507
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:18,978
contributing code. You don't
need to contribute code. It's-

508
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:21,152
it's

509
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:25,173
about you can contribute in- in
your own way. Just reach out

510
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:27,066
and there might be things that-
that, you know, that the- the-

511
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:28,953
the

512
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,854
maintainer needs. And, you know,
you may be able to help- help

513
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:34,878
there. But just-- I guess, to
kind of sum up at the very least

514
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:36,902
the

515
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:38,421
last part is just be very open
minded on how you-- how you'd

516
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:39,933
like

517
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:42,903
to contribute to the community,
you know? Like, you don't

518
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:45,153
necessarily have to contribute
something that, you know, gets

519
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:47,181
merged into a pull request.
Well, yeah. But just be very

520
00:23:47,181 --> 00:23:49,209
open minded on

521
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:50,979
how you'd contribute to the
community-- to- to- to that

522
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:52,749
community.

523
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:55,088
And focus on community, you
know? Even if it's a small

524
00:23:55,088 --> 00:23:57,398
community,

525
00:23:57,398 --> 00:24:01,598
just focus on the relationships
that you're building with- with

526
00:24:01,598 --> 00:24:04,689
these people. It's not just
about, you know, you write

527
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:06,413
something, and then merge
requests, and then you, you

528
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:08,107
know,

529
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:11,378
you go off somewhere, you know?
It's about building those

530
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:12,500
relationships, you know?

531
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:12,700
Bekah: Yeah.

532
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,269
Chad: That's- that's what I
would say. Sorry

533
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:15,509
for cutting you out.

534
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:18,902
Bekah: No, no, no. I love that.
I love focusing-- especially for

535
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:22,084
first time contributors on that
interaction, on the community

536
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:26,433
building of things because
getting into open source can be

537
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:30,574
really nerve-wracking or seem
really hard to do. But you're

538
00:24:30,574 --> 00:24:33,544
right. If you find that right
community, it makes it a lot

539
00:24:33,548 --> 00:24:36,394
easier for you and you are
building those relationships.

540
00:24:36,723 --> 00:24:39,155
And, you know, i-if we look at
even some of the larger open

541
00:24:39,155 --> 00:24:41,587
source

542
00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:45,759
projects, sometimes- sometimes
there's a need for smaller

543
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,929
contributions or sometimes their
first time contributor issues

544
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:52,929
are exactly like what you were
talking about. Like, "I have no

545
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:56,499
idea what you're talking about.
This is not for me." And then

546
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:59,753
that's okay, you know? There are
other opportunities out there.

547
00:24:59,993 --> 00:25:02,693
And this is one of my pet peeves
where people are, like, this is

548
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:04,103
not in the spirit of
Hacktoberfest. And they wanna

549
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:05,513
say like,

550
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:07,733
"Oh, you can't make a
contribution that looks like

551
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:09,713
this or that. Just

552
00:25:09,713 --> 00:25:15,338
changes one thing." And I- I
think that maybe that's how you

553
00:25:15,338 --> 00:25:17,453
feel about your project, but
that doesn't necessarily apply

554
00:25:17,453 --> 00:25:19,568
to

555
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:22,568
other people's projects. There
are a lot of projects out there

556
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:26,709
that are community run, that are
people who are trying to

557
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,489
collaborate, and work together,
and support other people. So

558
00:25:28,489 --> 00:25:30,269
there

559
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:34,118
are lots of different projects.
There's different approaches to

560
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:38,318
open source contribution. And
finding that community that's

561
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:41,138
going to support you is going to
help you to make that

562
00:25:41,548 --> 00:25:41,949
contribution.

563
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:46,078
Chad: Absolutely. Absolutely. I
agree. And I'd like to touch on

564
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,073
a little bit about, you know,
there are a lot of kind of

565
00:25:48,073 --> 00:25:50,068
community

566
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:53,141
run projects. I've been there.
So, [chuckles] this is-- this is

567
00:25:53,141 --> 00:25:56,208
kind of funny.

568
00:25:56,269 --> 00:25:58,428
I went through-- just looking up
a lot of interview prep

569
00:25:58,428 --> 00:26:00,587
stuff.

570
00:26:00,594 --> 00:26:04,398
Cuz to be quite honest, I did a
lot of that within the last--

571
00:26:04,403 --> 00:26:06,275
not within the last couple of
months, but years prior, I was

572
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:08,147
doing

573
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:11,261
a lot of interview prep. And
there are so many kind of, you

574
00:26:11,261 --> 00:26:14,374
know,

575
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:16,354
thing-- I don't know if they're
necessarily open source

576
00:26:16,354 --> 00:26:18,334
projects,

577
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:20,028
but they're projects that, you
know, have the GitHub that's,

578
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:21,722
you know,

579
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:23,808
open to the world. And, you
know, like, as far as I know,

580
00:26:23,808 --> 00:26:25,893
it's not

581
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:27,948
a paid product, you know? I
think it's-- yeah. I don't

582
00:26:27,948 --> 00:26:30,002
think it's

583
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:31,671
a paid product. Like, for
instance, there-- there's-

584
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:33,333
there's the

585
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:36,483
algorithms which is something
that I just recently found out

586
00:26:36,753 --> 00:26:41,568
about, which is literally a
project of a bunch of kinda data

587
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:46,788
structures and algorithms that
you would see in interviews.

588
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:50,689
And it's, like, a huge kinda log
of them in different languages.

589
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:54,169
You know what I mean? And as far
as I know, that's not a paid

590
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:55,638
product. It's just out there,
you know? And, like, I was

591
00:26:55,638 --> 00:26:57,107
bookmarking

592
00:26:57,108 --> 00:26:58,563
a bunch of these things. But
there's that-- there's that.

593
00:26:58,563 --> 00:27:00,018
Like,

594
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:04,489
there's the- the- the-- what you
call it? The tech interview

595
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,114
handbook which kind of gives you
like a real-- you know,

596
00:27:07,114 --> 00:27:09,739
it's a

597
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:13,429
great breakdown of how
interviewing is, how you study,

598
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:15,273
you know? What you-- what people
are- are looking. Funny

599
00:27:15,273 --> 00:27:16,938
enough.

600
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:21,499
The thing that I-- that draw me
to that was, you know, what--

601
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:23,329
you know, there-- they-- it
described, like, how people are-

602
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:25,159
are kind of

603
00:27:25,163 --> 00:27:28,788
looking- looking at you, at,
like, big tech interview-- the-

604
00:27:28,788 --> 00:27:30,078
the point I'm making is all of
those things, when you look at

605
00:27:30,078 --> 00:27:31,368
them on

606
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:35,300
GitHub, they're really just,
like, markdown files, you know?

607
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:35,778
I think they are. But

608
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:38,449
they're- they're not, like,
anything crazy, you know? You're

609
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:42,979
not, like, using Redux to- to
display all of this information,

610
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:45,431
you know what I mean? But those
projects, like, that have

611
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:47,883
hundreds of

612
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:51,903
contributors. And, you know,
like, you can contribute to that

613
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:55,233
project. Say- say for instance,
you've done a massive amount of

614
00:27:55,233 --> 00:27:56,808
interviewing — to- to kind of
stay in context — the ma-

615
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,383
massive

616
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:02,223
amount of interviewing and you
feel like there's an issue here,

617
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:06,084
issue with some of the
information here, you could most

618
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,018
definitely reach out or- or- or
apply a change. And I- I mean,

619
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:09,952
even

620
00:28:09,953 --> 00:28:11,993
then, it's, like, all of this is
kinda talking about

621
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:13,808
information, right? So, you
know, say there's, like, typos

622
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:15,623
or it's

623
00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:19,163
just not as clear, you can
definitely just, you know, clear

624
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:21,883
up that information or reach out
to whoever. And- and, like, that

625
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:24,603
isn't

626
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:26,719
necessarily code in the se- in-
in the sense that most people

627
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:28,834
think

628
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:31,804
of open source projects. When
people think of open s- or

629
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:33,663
contributing to open source
projects, they think about

630
00:28:33,663 --> 00:28:35,522
adding

631
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:42,213
a feature or refactoring. Very
much like code, you know? Very

632
00:28:42,213 --> 00:28:47,493
much like that very particular
use case. When there's-- like I

633
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:49,806
said, there's a whole breadth of
things that you can-- you can--

634
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:52,113
you can

635
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:56,284
do. And I mean, we're- we're--
even- even this conversation,

636
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:59,918
we're kinda talking about the--
at least, the- the way I'm kind

637
00:28:59,923 --> 00:29:03,038
of thinking about it is like if
you're doing open source, you're

638
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:06,308
literally on GitHub, you
literally go to the project, and

639
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:07,898
then it's just, like, however,
right? But, you know, if

640
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:09,488
you're--

641
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,209
if the- the open source project
has a community, you know, you

642
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,293
may not necessarily even be on
GitHub, you know? Like, you

643
00:29:15,293 --> 00:29:17,377
could be--

644
00:29:17,384 --> 00:29:20,528
you could be a part of their
Discord, and you could be, like,

645
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:23,558
moderating their Discord and
something like that, you know?

646
00:29:23,648 --> 00:29:26,648
Like, that's still contr-
contributing, you know what I

647
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:29,443
mean? So, like, I just-- I guess
I just wanted to- to- to,

648
00:29:29,443 --> 00:29:32,238
again,

649
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:36,558
reemphasize that there's a lot
of things that you can do to

650
00:29:36,564 --> 00:29:40,909
contribute to community, you
know? Like, it's, again, it's

651
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:44,500
not just writing co- I wanna say
JavaScripts of that [Bekah

652
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:44,929
chuckles]. It's not

653
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:47,778
just writing JavaScript, you
know what I mean? It's just not

654
00:29:47,808 --> 00:29:51,949
writing code. Like, there's a
lot of ways you can-- you can

655
00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:54,266
contribute and it's just keeping
that open mind of the- the- the,

656
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:56,583
you know,

657
00:29:56,733 --> 00:30:00,000
the- the needs of the- the- the
maintainer.

658
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,300
Bekah: Yeah.

659
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,294
Chad: That's pretty much it.

660
00:30:01,443 --> 00:30:03,303
Dan: Yeah, I love that. You
know, and- and Virtual Coffee

661
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:05,163
[chuckles] for

662
00:30:05,163 --> 00:30:06,753
example, right? And we have lots
of volunteers that are-- that

663
00:30:06,753 --> 00:30:08,343
help

664
00:30:08,344 --> 00:30:10,038
our community. But also, like,
our- our site is open source.

665
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:11,732
And ...

666
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:13,683
I don't know. Like, 80% of the
files are just content, you

667
00:30:13,683 --> 00:30:14,883
know what I mean?

668
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:19,114
Just-- and it-- I suppose it's
code technically or

669
00:30:19,114 --> 00:30:20,388
something [chuckles], you know?
But it's-- like, the- the

670
00:30:20,388 --> 00:30:21,662
valuable parts of

671
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:23,673
it are the-- are the words,
right? Are the content, you

672
00:30:23,673 --> 00:30:25,683
know? And ...

673
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:28,953
I- I mean, I love that advice. I
think it's great and very

674
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,933
important to keep in mind. And
also, it's, like-- sometimes —

675
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:32,451
especially when you get into
docs and stuff like that is —

676
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:33,963
sometimes

677
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:38,074
really hard for maintainers to
keep up to date or to make, you

678
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:39,949
know, like, to catch all the
edge cases and the things like

679
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:41,824
that.

680
00:30:41,854 --> 00:30:45,094
Ayu from Virtual Coffee is
really good at this shit. You

681
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:46,668
know, how many times have you
done, like, some install--

682
00:30:46,668 --> 00:30:48,242
followed

683
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:50,883
the README, right? Done some
install thing, and it didn't

684
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:52,308
work, and you had to like Google
around, and try a couple

685
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,732
different things

686
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:56,554
to get something to work, right?
And then, what I do most of the

687
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:57,768
time is just, "Okay, cool. I got
it working. I'll just move on,"

688
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:58,982
[chuckles]

689
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,453
you know? But how val- how much,
like, it would be a very easy

690
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:01,923
and

691
00:31:01,923 --> 00:31:04,458
valuable contribution to that-
that project to just go back and

692
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,993
add, like,

693
00:31:07,054 --> 00:31:09,574
a- a pull request that just adds
a little note in the README

694
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:12,453
that says, "Hey, if you run into
this error, try this fix," you

695
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:16,413
know what I mean? And I think
that's the kind of thing

696
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:19,983
that a lot of people maybe don't
consider right away. But it--

697
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:21,000
I don't know, can be--

698
00:31:20,808 --> 00:31:23,058
Bekah: Kinda like that error
that I have running the Virtual

699
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:25,098
Coffee site that I still haven't
[chuckles] done anything about?

700
00:31:25,413 --> 00:31:26,238
Dan: Right. Well, that's a whole
different ... yeah, issue--

701
00:31:26,238 --> 00:31:27,063
situation.

702
00:31:27,378 --> 00:31:28,939
Bekah: No, that's a Netlify CLI
issue actually.

703
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,549
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. But- but- but
it is the same thing. I mean,

704
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:32,044
like,

705
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:33,738
it's- it's the same thing.
Like-- okay. Like, maybe that is

706
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:35,432
something we

707
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:36,723
need to add. Cuz other people--
most people don't have the

708
00:31:36,723 --> 00:31:38,013
Netlify

709
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:40,218
CLI installed, like, to start
and-- but you already did. And

710
00:31:40,218 --> 00:31:42,423
so

711
00:31:42,423 --> 00:31:46,354
there's something going on and
maybe there's some note we need

712
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:49,564
to add or some parameter to add
to the install steps, you know?

713
00:31:49,564 --> 00:31:51,000
I don't know. I don't know what
it is but, like, even-

714
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,300
Bekah: Yeah [chuckles].

715
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:51,723
Dan: -just bringing

716
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:54,273
it up in issue, like, even
honestly, writing an issue is

717
00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:55,000
contributing to an open source.

718
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:55,800
Bekah: Yes.

719
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,084
Dan: Like, not fixing it, not-
not

720
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:02,928
knowing the solution, but just,
like, logging a problem. It can

721
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:04,548
be a very valuable contribution
to [chuckles] an open source

722
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,107
project

723
00:32:06,108 --> 00:32:07,623
because most likely, the
maintainer doesn't know about

724
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:09,138
it, you know?

725
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:13,759
Our maintainers don't know about
it. Like, the-- or they do and

726
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:20,209
they forgot or [chuckles], you
know, anything. And I- I- I--

727
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:21,408
yeah, I don't know. I- I think
everything you said is- is

728
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:22,547
right.

729
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:26,689
And I- I think it's great. I
love that also. I just talk a

730
00:32:26,689 --> 00:32:30,078
little bit more. I love that
idea about helping- helping

731
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:33,618
maintainers in areas outside of
GitHub even and how valuable

732
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,398
that can be. I think-- I think
that's another thing that people

733
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:40,128
don't maybe always think about.
But asking maintainers if they

734
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:44,388
need help outside of writing
code, it can be nice and it

735
00:32:44,388 --> 00:32:45,783
can be nice- nice to, like, have
somebody to reach out-- reach

736
00:32:45,783 --> 00:32:47,178
out

737
00:32:47,183 --> 00:32:48,726
[chuckles] to you too, you know,
sometimes. Say, "Hey, do you

738
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:50,269
need any help

739
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:52,548
with this?" Even if-- even if
they say no, it's- it's, like, a

740
00:32:52,548 --> 00:32:54,798
nice ... I don't know. Nice
gesture.

741
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Chad: Yeah--

742
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:55,894
Bekah: Yeah, I--

743
00:32:56,443 --> 00:32:56,923
Chad: Oh, go ahead, go ahead, go
ahead.

744
00:32:57,034 --> 00:33:00,183
Bekah: Sorry. I- I gave a talk
on ... I think it was called Do

745
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:03,604
You Need Community? And it was
from the perspective of if

746
00:33:03,604 --> 00:33:07,354
you're maybe getting into code
or if you are in tech and you

747
00:33:07,354 --> 00:33:09,109
don't have a community, what-
what would be the reasons and

748
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:10,864
the

749
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:14,223
benefits. And part of that, I
talked about getting involved in

750
00:33:14,223 --> 00:33:15,963
organizations. And sometimes
people say like, "Hey, do you

751
00:33:15,963 --> 00:33:17,703
need

752
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:20,374
any help?" And there's so much
overwhelmed sometimes as a

753
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:21,530
maintainer that it's like,
"Yeah, but I don't even know

754
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,682
where to

755
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:26,673
start," right? And so being more
specific like, "Hey, do you need

756
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:29,253
any help? I'm really good at
building chat bots. And I think

757
00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:30,678
this could be really
beneficial." Like, giving that

758
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:32,103
specific thing

759
00:33:32,104 --> 00:33:34,701
or, "Hey, I like to post on
social media. Can I write some

760
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:37,298
tweets

761
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:39,293
for you?" And, you know, you're
not getting a green box for

762
00:33:39,293 --> 00:33:41,288
that. And

763
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:43,208
I know that it can be really
hard to feel like, "Oh, there--

764
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:45,098
I

765
00:33:45,098 --> 00:33:47,739
haven't accomplished anything."
But you've supported a community

766
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:51,608
of people that- that is
supporting other people. So--

767
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,306
and I- I think the-- one of the
things I like, too, about

768
00:33:53,306 --> 00:33:54,998
Virtual Coffee,

769
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:58,838
our members page just keeps
evolving into something better

770
00:33:58,838 --> 00:34:00,668
and better because we have our
members who have to create a

771
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:02,498
pull

772
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:07,209
request to get their profile on
our mem- members page. But then

773
00:34:07,568 --> 00:34:12,759
last year, the issue was you can
add your social links. And

774
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,478
we've updated it with all of our
active volunteers. So, you know,

775
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:20,943
like, finding ways to also
support the people who are

776
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:24,094
supporting your project in other
ways is incredibly important as

777
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:24,483
well.

778
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:29,938
Chad: I agree. I agree. And I
also want to kind of reiterate

779
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:34,588
that, like, you know, you- you--
for- for the people who are

780
00:34:34,588 --> 00:34:38,428
actually contributing code,
they-- a lot of those people do

781
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:39,700
that to improve their skills,
right?

782
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:39,900
Bekah: Mm.

783
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,909
Chad: To come across problems
that they

784
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:44,608
generally wouldn't come across
or be more difficult for them to

785
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:48,240
come across o-on their own,
right? But I think the most

786
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,872
important

787
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:57,934
part of open source as a
contributor is to-- is that

788
00:34:57,934 --> 00:34:59,839
interaction. The interaction
with people, you know what I

789
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,744
mean? And

790
00:35:01,748 --> 00:35:05,434
so definitely being-- having
something where it's like--

791
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:06,903
okay, you reach out to the
maintainers. It's like, "Hey, I

792
00:35:06,903 --> 00:35:08,372
can do this,"

793
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:09,858
you know? Like you were saying,
you know? "I can-- I can do

794
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,343
tweets,"

795
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:16,098
and so on and so forth. Like,
that interaction is so valuable.

796
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:18,528
And the con- that consistency of
interaction is so valuable.

797
00:35:18,528 --> 00:35:20,957
Like,

798
00:35:21,168 --> 00:35:23,958
you'd be surprised, you'd be--
you'd be maintaining a project

799
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,248
and there's just somebody who,
you know, you- you know them--

800
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,538
you

801
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:28,716
know them casually and then they
turn out to be-- well, 50% of

802
00:35:28,716 --> 00:35:30,893
the

803
00:35:30,893 --> 00:35:35,333
time, they turn on to be, you
know, your- your next employer

804
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,123
because they're now op- offering
you an opportunity. I- I was

805
00:35:38,123 --> 00:35:41,183
watching a video recently, you
know, I'm just going to be-- I

806
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:45,300
was watching a video from
OpenSauced recently, where-- I

807
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,284
don't remember who he

808
00:35:46,284 --> 00:35:51,923
was or who Brian was talking to,
but he was talking about how

809
00:35:51,923 --> 00:35:54,263
we had an open source project
and, like, it became more and

810
00:35:54,263 --> 00:35:56,603
more of a--

811
00:35:57,844 --> 00:36:01,414
of a-- I don't remember exactly
the- the- the circumstances. But

812
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:03,633
he-- and he started hiring a lot
of people because he had

813
00:36:03,633 --> 00:36:05,672
somebody

814
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:06,951
who was-- he had started
hiring-- not a lot of people. He

815
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:08,223
started

816
00:36:08,224 --> 00:36:12,603
hiring from his contributors
because his contributors were

817
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:14,298
very consistent, they were
excellent, you know, in what

818
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:15,903
the--

819
00:36:15,903 --> 00:36:17,403
in their contributions. And he
just-- he was just like, "Hey,

820
00:36:17,403 --> 00:36:18,903
you

821
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:21,153
want to-- you want a full time
job?" And they were like, "Yeah,

822
00:36:21,153 --> 00:36:23,876
sure." And that's how they found
their next opportunity, you

823
00:36:23,876 --> 00:36:26,599
know?

824
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:32,119
And so it's really about those
relationships, you know? As a

825
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:33,693
contributor. As a-- as a
maintainer, you know, like,

826
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:35,267
that's

827
00:36:35,268 --> 00:36:38,329
a-- I don't want to talk about
that too much cuz that's just

828
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,994
not-- I don't have the
experience there. But as a

829
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:41,659
contributor, it's

830
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:45,259
about building those
relationships. And, like, it's

831
00:36:45,259 --> 00:36:49,809
just a different avenue of- of
building those relationships

832
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:53,227
with people. And then, you know,
showing that, you know, like-- I

833
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:56,588
guess going back to- to coding,
showing that, you know, you can

834
00:36:56,588 --> 00:36:58,313
code — that's, like, one of the
big issues, the big problems

835
00:36:58,313 --> 00:37:00,038
with-

836
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:01,958
with junior developers trying to
get positions — is that,

837
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,877
effectively,

838
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:06,849
they have to prove that they-
they know how to code and they

839
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,423
can just be like, "Hey, look at
my contribution to this open

840
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:09,997
source project

841
00:37:09,998 --> 00:37:13,119
that got," you know, "that got
merged, and is being used in

842
00:37:13,123 --> 00:37:14,993
the project right now, and has
my name on it," you know? "I can

843
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:16,863
code," [laughs] you know

844
00:37:16,864 --> 00:37:23,102
what I mean? Like-- so, like,
it's just-- yeah. It's just--

845
00:37:23,103 --> 00:37:25,143
it's about building those
relationships. Those

846
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,888
relationships will- will
definitely take you far. A-at

847
00:37:27,888 --> 00:37:30,633
least

848
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:33,752
in my-- in my opinion, that's,
like, one of the biggest things

849
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:33,903
for- for- for--

850
00:37:34,324 --> 00:37:35,703
Dan: Yeah. A-and- and not just
proving you can code but

851
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:37,082
proving that you have

852
00:37:37,143 --> 00:37:38,793
drive, and can operate on your
own, and things like that as

853
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:40,443
well.

854
00:37:41,313 --> 00:37:43,293
A-and you're interested in it,
and, you know, I- I- I think-- I

855
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:45,273
think that

856
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:48,611
sort of ... I don't know. A- a-
a full [chuckles], you know, I

857
00:37:48,611 --> 00:37:51,739
don't-- I don't wanna say,

858
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:54,949
like, all- all the green squares
are green but, like, you know--

859
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:57,228
you know, a full, like, GitHub
profile where you have a lot of

860
00:37:57,228 --> 00:38:01,309
contributions to some things can
go a really long way to

861
00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:03,198
showing that-- y-you know, even
if you're not, like, write--

862
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,087
like you

863
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:06,948
said, like, rewriting the React
codebase, you know? [Laughs]

864
00:38:06,948 --> 00:38:08,808
Like, it-

865
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:09,964
it doesn't have to be like that,
obviously, e-e-especially when

866
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:11,119
you're

867
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,948
starting out. But just, like,
connecting with people and- and-

868
00:38:12,948 --> 00:38:14,777
and

869
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:17,388
contributing in-- I don't know.
I- I-- yeah. I agree. It's can

870
00:38:17,388 --> 00:38:19,008
be a

871
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:21,259
very valuable tool — open source
contributions.

872
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:26,764
Bekah: I know a woman who really
wanted to work with a- a pretty

873
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:31,293
notable tech organization. But
their interview process was

874
00:38:31,293 --> 00:38:35,883
notoriously hard. And she knew
she would not be able to pass

875
00:38:35,884 --> 00:38:40,852
the interview process. And, you
know, didn't have time to devote

876
00:38:41,103 --> 00:38:42,918
hours and months of her life to
studying for it. And so she

877
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:44,733
started

878
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:46,923
contributing to their open
source project. And sure enough,

879
00:38:46,923 --> 00:38:49,113
she got

880
00:38:49,114 --> 00:38:52,143
hired without having to go
through that interview process

881
00:38:52,143 --> 00:38:54,993
because she was familiar with
the codebase. They knew that

882
00:38:54,994 --> 00:38:59,074
her work was good and that she
could- could be a part of the

883
00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:01,623
team because of that community
collaboration that she already

884
00:39:01,623 --> 00:39:05,193
had. So, I mean, not everybody's
gonna let you navigate

885
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:08,344
around the interview process.
But it was really, really great

886
00:39:08,344 --> 00:39:12,494
strategy for, you know, not only
learning more it yourself but

887
00:39:12,494 --> 00:39:16,333
like you're saying, finding new
avenues to job opportunities.

888
00:39:17,744 --> 00:39:21,164
Chad: Agreed. Agreed. I actually
was-- I don't necessarily have

889
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:23,101
a direct story, but I've
definitely heard of other people

890
00:39:23,101 --> 00:39:25,034
who've had

891
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:27,328
similar experiences, who-- they-
they contributed to- to-

892
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:29,622
to large

893
00:39:29,623 --> 00:39:34,184
open source projects for pretty
well-known companies and, you

894
00:39:34,184 --> 00:39:36,001
know, no interview processes,
like, "We- we see that you co-

895
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:37,818
we see that

896
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:40,909
you can code. We," you know, "we
want you to work on this

897
00:39:40,909 --> 00:39:44,418
thing," you know? So they just
brought them on board, you know?

898
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:47,688
It wasn't that-- it wasn't a
big, crazy thing, you know? They

899
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:51,528
didn't have to study for- for-
for months like you said, you

900
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:56,808
know? Definitely, like-- and
from my understanding, that is--

901
00:39:56,809 --> 00:40:00,049
that is not uncommon, you know?
Like, it's not an uncommon

902
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:03,289
circumstance

903
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:05,553
at all, you know? So,
definitely-- I definitely--

904
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:07,817
again, you know, it's

905
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:11,719
about those relationships. It's
about, you know, it's about

906
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,259
building those relationships
with- with- with those-- with

907
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:19,369
those people, you know? And even
with other contributors as well,

908
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:23,778
you know? Like, how- how many
people have- have kind of come-

909
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:26,688
come to Virtual Coffee and have
become friends with each other

910
00:40:27,173 --> 00:40:31,509
because of kind of their- their-
their meeting at Virtual Coffee

911
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:34,989
or doing work with vir- Virtual
Coffee, you know what I mean? So

912
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:38,739
it's definitely about building
those relationships. Again, in

913
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:39,068
my opinion.

914
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:40,879
Bekah: Yeah. Well, and I think,
too, one of the great things

915
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:41,929
about

916
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:44,599
contributing to open source is
also learning how to take

917
00:40:44,603 --> 00:40:48,707
feedback. Because oftentimes,
you know, you've got a PR and

918
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:51,259
it's not going to be perfect. So
you'll be getting some feedback.

919
00:40:51,528 --> 00:40:54,289
Do you have any experience with
that? And, you know, like, has

920
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:57,108
that helped you develop as a
developer [laughs]?

921
00:40:58,233 --> 00:41:01,353
Chad: It has definitely not
helped me develop as a developer

922
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:04,000
because that'd-- no, I'm just
[Chad and Bekah laugh]-- yeah,

923
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,103
I've gotten-- I've

924
00:41:05,103 --> 00:41:09,543
definitely gotten feedback.
Like, one of the kinda key

925
00:41:09,543 --> 00:41:12,873
things about just being
coachable, you know? And again,

926
00:41:12,963 --> 00:41:18,934
like, because it's a learning
experience, you know? Like, I

927
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:22,804
don't wanna say-- well, because
it's a learning experience, you

928
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:25,000
should really be happy for
feedback, you know?

929
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,300
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

930
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,673
Chad: Like, you

931
00:41:26,673 --> 00:41:27,798
don't want somebody to be giving
you a feedback where they're,

932
00:41:27,798 --> 00:41:28,923
like,

933
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:29,700
"[Angry tone] Argh, argh, argh,"
you know? And

934
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,134
they're just kinda yelling down.
Like, nobody

935
00:41:32,134 --> 00:41:33,768
wants that, you know what I
mean? But if it's like, "Hey, I

936
00:41:33,768 --> 00:41:35,402
would

937
00:41:35,403 --> 00:41:37,683
structure it this way." Like,
that's, like, the key thing

938
00:41:37,683 --> 00:41:39,963
about, you

939
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:42,198
know, contributions, right?
Like, ab- about open source,

940
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:44,433
right? Like, I

941
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:47,164
don't wanna say it's judgment
free. Again, you know, it

942
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:50,061
depends on who's giving you the
feedback. But it's- it's- it's

943
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:52,954
somewhat

944
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:54,740
non-committal in that sense-- in
a sense, you know? Like, you

945
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,522
don't

946
00:41:56,554 --> 00:42:00,333
have to give your contribution.
You absolutely don't have to.

947
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:04,384
It's not life or death, you know
what I mean? So, a lot of the

948
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:09,422
times, like, you can give your--
you can give a contribution and

949
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:13,893
they give you feedback. And that
feedback is just gold. You know

950
00:42:13,893 --> 00:42:16,833
what I mean? It's just, like,
there's stuff that they talk

951
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:18,876
about, that they-- that you
didn't know or even necessarily,

952
00:42:18,876 --> 00:42:20,914
they

953
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:24,934
give you feedback, and you push
back on the feedback, and say,

954
00:42:24,934 --> 00:42:26,553
"Hey, this is my-- this is the
reason why ...," like, all of

955
00:42:26,553 --> 00:42:28,172
that-

956
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:31,998
that interaction is extremely
important. That's what you're

957
00:42:31,998 --> 00:42:37,608
gonna be doing on the job, you
know? Like, code review is going

958
00:42:37,608 --> 00:42:39,453
to happen [laughs]. It, like--
well, I don't wanna say it's

959
00:42:39,453 --> 00:42:41,298
going to happen.

960
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:43,023
There are some companies--
anyways. But, like, the

961
00:42:43,023 --> 00:42:44,748
likelihood

962
00:42:44,748 --> 00:42:47,373
of that is so high. Like, that
is just an interaction that you

963
00:42:47,373 --> 00:42:49,998
have

964
00:42:49,998 --> 00:42:54,619
to go through, you know? And not
only that, like, the amount of

965
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:58,489
information that you can get
from somebody saying, you know,

966
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:00,800
"I don't think is-- this is the
best way of doing it. I think

967
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,219
this is-- a- a better

968
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:08,179
way is this ...," is, like--
especially when it's-- it can

969
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:12,498
potentially be difficult or just
hard to- to- to get

970
00:43:12,498 --> 00:43:15,559
information and to be able to
leverage it immediately. Like,

971
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:18,978
you know, you can go to a
tutorial and you can learn a

972
00:43:18,978 --> 00:43:22,458
bunch of things but a lot of the
times, if it doesn't apply

973
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:26,178
to whatever you're doing right
now, you know, it doesn't stick,

974
00:43:26,184 --> 00:43:28,656
unless you keep doing it over
and over. But, like, getting

975
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:31,128
that feedback,

976
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:34,804
you know, on something that
you're working on, and then

977
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:36,859
leveraging it, and then, you
know, like saying, "Okay, I've

978
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:38,914
applied

979
00:43:38,914 --> 00:43:41,853
it," or, "I don't-- I don't
necessarily agree with your

980
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:45,903
feedback." Like, that is such an
important thing. Even if you

981
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:48,634
don't agree with it, it might be
something whereas, you know,

982
00:43:48,634 --> 00:43:51,123
might be another tool in your
toolbox. You know what I mean?

983
00:43:51,123 --> 00:43:54,250
So, like, it's- it's kind-- it's
still kind of sticky

984
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,377
because, again, you

985
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,958
know, some people are a little
bit more harsh with their

986
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:03,259
feedback. Or it's not even
necessarily harsh, but their

987
00:44:03,259 --> 00:44:08,539
feedback doesn't kind of mesh
with how your culturally kind of

988
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:13,877
built to accept feedback, you
know? But, like, for the most

989
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:16,009
part, like, all of that stuff
can potentially be gold to you,

990
00:44:16,009 --> 00:44:17,509
especially as a--

991
00:44:17,778 --> 00:44:21,528
as a new person still learning,
you know? If, like, them telling

992
00:44:21,528 --> 00:44:24,168
you, "Hey, I don't think this is
necessarily the best way," you

993
00:44:24,168 --> 00:44:26,426
know? Like, all of that is great
stuff, you know? That stuff that

994
00:44:26,426 --> 00:44:28,684
you

995
00:44:28,684 --> 00:44:32,943
can-- you can put-- you can put
away and then, like, potentially

996
00:44:32,943 --> 00:44:34,608
work on later. Like, even if,
say, your contribution doesn't

997
00:44:34,608 --> 00:44:36,273
get

998
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,163
accepted for whatever reason,
you know? Like, that information

999
00:44:38,163 --> 00:44:40,053
for

1000
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:44,462
you is really, really good when
you're learning, you know? And

1001
00:44:44,463 --> 00:44:48,453
it really just kind of like, I
would say in terms of navigating

1002
00:44:48,514 --> 00:44:50,643
code- code-- I don't wanna say--
well, getting feedback, it

1003
00:44:50,643 --> 00:44:52,772
really just

1004
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:56,789
kinda understanding the person
and how they're giving feedback.

1005
00:44:57,148 --> 00:44:59,233
And if they're giving, like,
feedback that is not

1006
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:01,318
particularly

1007
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:04,500
great or is demeaning, you know,
let's get up and walk away.

1008
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:04,700
Bekah: Mm-hmm.

1009
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,350
Chad: Again, you're not
committed, you know? Like, if

1010
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,668
they're going to be that

1011
00:45:08,668 --> 00:45:11,699
person, you know, that-- that's
not somebody you want to be

1012
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:14,116
associated with, you know, in
any form of kinda long term

1013
00:45:14,116 --> 00:45:16,533
anything, you

1014
00:45:16,534 --> 00:45:19,864
know? But generally, like-- you
know, people are very friendly.

1015
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:22,474
Like, people [chuckles] want you
to come back. Like, some people

1016
00:45:22,474 --> 00:45:25,023
desperately want you to come
back, you know? It's, like, you

1017
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:26,763
know, "I'm working on this by
myself [chuckles]," or, "I'm

1018
00:45:26,763 --> 00:45:28,503
working on this

1019
00:45:28,503 --> 00:45:30,138
with a small group of people,"
you know? "More people who are

1020
00:45:30,138 --> 00:45:31,773
working with

1021
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:34,773
me," you know, "the better." You
know what I mean? So it's in

1022
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:38,035
their-- it's-- they're
incentivized to- to- to kinda

1023
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:41,297
keep you

1024
00:45:41,298 --> 00:45:45,289
coming back, you know what I
mean? That's-- and there's also,

1025
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:46,998
like-- and this is a part of--
kind of the community aspect of-

1026
00:45:46,998 --> 00:45:48,707
of open

1027
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:50,733
source or a particular open
source project. Like, how to

1028
00:45:50,733 --> 00:45:52,758
kind of

1029
00:45:52,759 --> 00:46:00,168
contribute and, like, having a--
having a system kind of around

1030
00:46:00,168 --> 00:46:02,530
contribution in the sense of,
you know, code style, you know,

1031
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:04,892
tools

1032
00:46:04,893 --> 00:46:08,134
that you- you- you are using and
stuff like that. Being very

1033
00:46:08,134 --> 00:46:10,608
structured in that way, it
really kind of lets people know

1034
00:46:10,608 --> 00:46:13,082
how to--

1035
00:46:13,594 --> 00:46:17,583
how to approach the project. You
know what I mean? So that's also

1036
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:19,608
a good thing to kind of look
for. It does-- it doesn't

1037
00:46:19,608 --> 00:46:21,633
necessarily-- it

1038
00:46:21,634 --> 00:46:24,813
doesn't necessarily address
feedback directly, you know? But

1039
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:26,614
it kinda addressed what- what
your expectations of the

1040
00:46:26,614 --> 00:46:28,114
feedback

1041
00:46:28,114 --> 00:46:30,409
will- will- will be, you know?
But-- yeah. Like, I-- yeah,

1042
00:46:30,409 --> 00:46:32,704
[unintelligible]--

1043
00:46:32,898 --> 00:46:36,000
Dan: So, as a-- as a
contributor-- like, a potential

1044
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,648
contri- contributor to a

1045
00:46:36,648 --> 00:46:39,108
project, what- what are your
steps? Like, what do you do

1046
00:46:39,108 --> 00:46:41,553
before- before you, like, file a
pull request? Like, what do

1047
00:46:41,553 --> 00:46:43,998
you--

1048
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:45,393
like, I assume you maybe read
the README. What- what else--

1049
00:46:45,393 --> 00:46:46,727
what other

1050
00:46:46,728 --> 00:46:48,756
kinda steps do you take, like,
to make sure that you're doing

1051
00:46:48,756 --> 00:46:50,784
what the--

1052
00:46:50,784 --> 00:46:52,563
what the maintainers want you to
do, you know?

1053
00:46:53,253 --> 00:46:55,218
Chad: To be fair-- so, I've
mostly been working with

1054
00:46:55,218 --> 00:46:57,183
OpenSauced. And

1055
00:46:57,184 --> 00:46:59,208
they've had-- they have a very
good, you know, kind of

1056
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:01,232
contributors

1057
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:06,603
doc, you know? And so they kind
of put the systems in place so

1058
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:08,403
that you don't necessarily-- so
that you don't mess up, you

1059
00:47:08,403 --> 00:47:10,203
know, in a

1060
00:47:10,264 --> 00:47:13,293
sense, right? So there's, like,
a lot of kind of guardrails

1061
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:15,588
and hand-holding that the-- that
the system will do, you know?

1062
00:47:15,588 --> 00:47:17,883
But,

1063
00:47:18,244 --> 00:47:20,163
like-- again, you know, you
can-- say, for instance, there

1064
00:47:20,163 --> 00:47:22,082
isn't

1065
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:28,023
really any contri- any, like,
docs on contributing. Generally,

1066
00:47:28,023 --> 00:47:31,173
that's the first place to start,
you know? Docs on contri- just

1067
00:47:31,173 --> 00:47:35,313
the- the- the kinda docs on the
infrastructure, right? Like, on

1068
00:47:35,494 --> 00:47:39,333
how you contribute. Just start
there, you know? Before- before

1069
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:40,970
anything else. Because a- a- a
good, well-maintained open

1070
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:42,602
source

1071
00:47:42,603 --> 00:47:46,668
project will at least have docs-
docs to- to- to tell you how to

1072
00:47:46,673 --> 00:47:49,699
contribute. If they don't
necessarily have docs, you may,

1073
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:53,119
you know, may reach out to the
maintainer and ask questions.

1074
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,859
You may file an issue, ask
questions. By the way, if they

1075
00:47:54,859 --> 00:47:56,599
don't have con-

1076
00:47:56,869 --> 00:47:59,284
docs on contributing, that's a
really good contribution

1077
00:47:59,284 --> 00:48:01,699
[laughs], you

1078
00:48:01,704 --> 00:48:04,341
know? Like-- but it's just
really-- just getting

1079
00:48:04,341 --> 00:48:06,978
clarification, how-

1080
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:09,378
however you can. Like, that
doesn't necessarily mean you

1081
00:48:09,378 --> 00:48:12,978
don't-- you can't just work on
the-- on the pull request

1082
00:48:12,983 --> 00:48:14,916
immediately. But, you know,
like, just getting clarification

1083
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:16,849
on how

1084
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:19,099
they kind of want the- the- the
pull request set up. Like-- and

1085
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:21,349
like I

1086
00:48:21,353 --> 00:48:24,318
said, get that clarification
however you can either they have

1087
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,680
docs written or you just reach
out to people di-directly, you

1088
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,042
know? You

1089
00:48:29,043 --> 00:48:32,523
may even kind of go back to- to-
to previous pull requests and-

1090
00:48:32,793 --> 00:48:36,543
and take a look at that. But I
would definitely say if they

1091
00:48:36,543 --> 00:48:40,023
don't have docs, just reach out
to the maintainer and- and- and

1092
00:48:40,023 --> 00:48:44,043
start there. I don't have the
most amount of experience here

1093
00:48:44,043 --> 00:48:47,703
because, you know, like, my open
source-- the project that I work

1094
00:48:47,704 --> 00:48:52,414
with mostly have a lot of these
kind of things in place. But,

1095
00:48:52,414 --> 00:48:54,393
you know, just getting that
clarification. Like, that's-

1096
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:56,074
that's the best way I would
submit them. Just get that

1097
00:48:56,074 --> 00:48:58,443
clarification first because it
would kinda-- it would kinda

1098
00:48:58,443 --> 00:49:00,812
suck

1099
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:02,118
where you do all of this work.
It may even take you, like, a

1100
00:49:02,118 --> 00:49:03,423
couple

1101
00:49:03,423 --> 00:49:04,773
of days. You do all of this work
and then you make a pull

1102
00:49:04,773 --> 00:49:06,123
request.

1103
00:49:06,423 --> 00:49:10,324
And then they- they- they deny
the pull request for

1104
00:49:10,324 --> 00:49:13,474
something simple that you could
have easily sorted out day one,

1105
00:49:13,923 --> 00:49:17,628
you know? And, you know, nobody
wants their pull request

1106
00:49:17,628 --> 00:49:20,778
rejected, you know what I mean?
So it's, like, it-- it's just,

1107
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:21,964
like, at the very least you can
just do those things if you

1108
00:49:21,964 --> 00:49:23,059
don't-- if

1109
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:24,708
you're not necessarily a hundred
percent clear, you know? That's-

1110
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:26,357
that's--

1111
00:49:27,693 --> 00:49:29,913
Bekah: Yeah. I love that. And-
and I mean-- so, you- you said

1112
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:32,133
you contribute to

1113
00:49:32,134 --> 00:49:34,864
OpenSauced and they've got a
great process. So if you wanna

1114
00:49:34,864 --> 00:49:37,384
get started and you wanna know
what a good project looks like

1115
00:49:37,384 --> 00:49:40,684
so you can identify other ones,
then go to OpenSauced and look

1116
00:49:40,893 --> 00:49:44,239
at what they have there. Because
that's a good way to start. And

1117
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:47,599
I know, you know, we've got a
pretty thorough contributing

1118
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,438
guidelines doc on our Virtual
Coffee site as well. And, you

1119
00:49:51,438 --> 00:49:53,568
know, sometimes there's
discussions — not everybody has

1120
00:49:53,568 --> 00:49:55,353
discussions enabled — but I
really like discussions for

1121
00:49:55,353 --> 00:49:57,138
being able

1122
00:49:57,139 --> 00:50:00,378
to have community members ask
questions about things and to

1123
00:50:00,384 --> 00:50:03,978
learn more. And then also,
discussions allows us to see,

1124
00:50:04,188 --> 00:50:07,429
"Okay, yeah. Maybe we're missing
something here or we could add

1125
00:50:07,429 --> 00:50:08,991
this. Now, here's an issue."
And, "Hey, since you brought it

1126
00:50:08,991 --> 00:50:10,553
up, do you

1127
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:14,693
want to be the one to make the
pull request for that

1128
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:19,673
project?" So, it is-- it is step
one is-- well, maybe it's not

1129
00:50:19,673 --> 00:50:23,333
step one. But a good step is
identifying what good projects

1130
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:26,693
look like so you can see them at
other places.

1131
00:50:27,768 --> 00:50:28,548
Chad: Definitely agree.

1132
00:50:28,548 --> 00:50:28,700
Bekah: Now-

1133
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,184
Chad: I'm sorry. Go ahead.

1134
00:50:29,184 --> 00:50:32,764
Bekah: -I'm-- I kinda wanna
pivot a little bit before we end

1135
00:50:32,793 --> 00:50:34,383
the podcast episode and talk
more about Tech is Hiring.

1136
00:50:34,383 --> 00:50:35,973
Because, you

1137
00:50:35,974 --> 00:50:38,583
know, all the things that we've
talked about, along with open

1138
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:42,184
source, I think contribute to
this idea of Tech is Hiring, the

1139
00:50:42,184 --> 00:50:44,853
idea of community, of
connection, of navigating

1140
00:50:44,853 --> 00:50:47,522
through a problem

1141
00:50:47,528 --> 00:50:52,832
that you identified. So what
kind of started your inspiration

1142
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:53,704
for Tech is Hiring?

1143
00:50:54,893 --> 00:51:00,114
Chad: Well, it started really
with my own job search. I- I

1144
00:51:00,114 --> 00:51:01,659
don't even know how I came
across this. But I realized

1145
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:03,204
that, you

1146
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:04,526
know, you could just make a
tweet and say, "Hey, I'm looking

1147
00:51:04,526 --> 00:51:05,844
for a

1148
00:51:05,844 --> 00:51:09,204
role." And people retweet it.
Like, people are very-- at the

1149
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:11,085
very least, in- in- in the tech
industry or on tech Twitter,

1150
00:51:11,085 --> 00:51:12,962
people

1151
00:51:13,074 --> 00:51:16,296
are very open about, you know,
helping people find new roles.

1152
00:51:16,296 --> 00:51:19,518
And so,

1153
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:21,244
you know, I was doing that a few
times, like, in my own job

1154
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,849
search.

1155
00:51:23,148 --> 00:51:26,268
And then, I think one day I was
retweeting, and I was just

1156
00:51:26,268 --> 00:51:28,383
realized, you know, if you don't
have a good network, and-- yeah,

1157
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:30,498
if

1158
00:51:30,498 --> 00:51:33,798
you don't have a good network,
you know, l-l-likelihood of you-

1159
00:51:33,878 --> 00:51:36,605
you-- the likelihood of your
tweet going viral in a sense

1160
00:51:36,605 --> 00:51:39,332
it--

1161
00:51:39,393 --> 00:51:43,833
that would help you is- is- is
pretty low. And so, you know, my

1162
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:46,384
first thought was like, "Hey, do
we have, like, a hashtag or

1163
00:51:46,384 --> 00:51:52,143
something that we can, you know,
that we can ... like, post our

1164
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:53,553
tweet to? So at the very least,
you know, it's in one

1165
00:51:53,553 --> 00:51:54,963
centralized

1166
00:51:54,963 --> 00:51:56,861
place?" And people were like,
"No." And I was just like,

1167
00:51:56,861 --> 00:51:58,759
"Okay." And

1168
00:51:58,759 --> 00:51:59,973
somebody had reached out and
they were literally like, "Oh,

1169
00:51:59,973 --> 00:52:01,187
so you're

1170
00:52:01,188 --> 00:52:03,618
gonna make a hashtag, right?"
And I was like, "I guess I am

1171
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:05,500
now." [laughs]. So I ended up
like-

1172
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:05,700
Bekah: Nice.

1173
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,599
Chad: -it- it-- yeah [laughs]. I
ended up taking, like, a

1174
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,498
couple of

1175
00:52:09,498 --> 00:52:11,328
days, just kind of trying to
come up with a name. And then,

1176
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,158
you

1177
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:16,458
know, I just made a quick post
and I was just like, "Hey, this

1178
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:20,239
hashtag," you know, "post to it
if you-- if you wanted to-- if

1179
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:25,773
you want to- to- to share your
tweet." And, like, I pretty much

1180
00:52:25,773 --> 00:52:28,173
did that. And initially, when
I-- when I made the first tweet,

1181
00:52:28,173 --> 00:52:30,573
I didn't--

1182
00:52:30,574 --> 00:52:32,883
I obviously didn't expect
anybody to, like, be jumping,

1183
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:35,192
you know, out

1184
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:38,343
to the woodwork, to kinda tweet
to it. So I just went out to my

1185
00:52:38,349 --> 00:52:42,647
way to go find tweets, you know?
So for people to share, to just

1186
00:52:42,653 --> 00:52:44,825
kinda encourage, and to build
that kind of backlog, right, of

1187
00:52:44,825 --> 00:52:46,997
places--

1188
00:52:47,028 --> 00:52:51,199
of- of- of resources. And, you
know, it just kind of grew from

1189
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:56,719
there. So, like, I started
adding tweets every day, you

1190
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:58,413
know-- every weekday I should
say. I started adding tweets

1191
00:52:58,413 --> 00:53:00,107
every

1192
00:53:00,108 --> 00:53:00,798
day, you know? And just took-
took a couple of minutes all to

1193
00:53:00,798 --> 00:53:02,868
my day. In

1194
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:05,088
fact, I'm probably gonna do that
right after I get off of this.

1195
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:10,338
But took a couple of minutes
just went through all, you

1196
00:53:10,338 --> 00:53:14,659
know, went and looked for- for
people looking for jobs or had

1197
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:17,358
jobs to share. And I would just
ask them if I could add it to

1198
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:19,548
Tech is Hiring. And I've just
been doing that. And, you know,

1199
00:53:19,548 --> 00:53:21,738
at the

1200
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:26,477
end of last year, I started
doing spaces around- around Tech

1201
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:29,958
is Hiring when- when spaces, you
know, became a feature that was

1202
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:35,298
open to the public. I started
doing that. And there's a--

1203
00:53:35,304 --> 00:53:38,728
there's definitely a lot of
people who just kinda like--

1204
00:53:39,028 --> 00:53:42,239
there's a lot of-- kind of-- I
don't wanna say there's a lot of

1205
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:46,079
information that people tend to
lack, you know? Like, even--

1206
00:53:46,168 --> 00:53:49,409
especially there's a lot of job
changes, right? So they may have

1207
00:53:49,414 --> 00:53:54,418
existed in an industry for
periods of time. Maybe years,

1208
00:53:54,418 --> 00:53:57,719
decades, right? And they're
transitioning into the tech

1209
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:00,028
industry. And, like, a simple
thing as how to structure your

1210
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,337
resume

1211
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:04,504
is- is something that they may
not necessarily know, you know

1212
00:54:04,504 --> 00:54:06,289
what I

1213
00:54:06,295 --> 00:54:09,918
mean? And it's actually fairly
difficult. It's not as difficult

1214
00:54:09,918 --> 00:54:11,598
now because there's
significantly more resources,

1215
00:54:11,598 --> 00:54:13,278
but it's fairly

1216
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:15,276
different-- difficult to find
out how to structure your resume

1217
00:54:15,276 --> 00:54:17,268
in a

1218
00:54:17,268 --> 00:54:21,738
good way. And so, you know, I
was just, like, you know, that's

1219
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:24,251
also resources that people could
have, you know? Like, people

1220
00:54:24,251 --> 00:54:26,763
have, you know,

1221
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:30,213
hiring, or just kind of job
search, or just those kind of

1222
00:54:30,213 --> 00:54:35,583
conversations on- on spaces. And
I'll share that, you know, when-

1223
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:38,103
whenever I can. It's like, "Hey,
do you mind if I add this to

1224
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:42,244
Tech is Hiring?" You know? And I
guess it just kinda evolved from

1225
00:54:42,244 --> 00:54:44,163
there. I eventually started a
newsletter to kinda do the

1226
00:54:44,163 --> 00:54:46,082
same thing

1227
00:54:46,414 --> 00:54:50,103
whereas, like, I have-- I'll
effectively curate the tweets

1228
00:54:50,103 --> 00:54:53,440
that I see. And then I'll just,
you know, take five of the--

1229
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,777
five people who are

1230
00:54:56,778 --> 00:55:01,428
looking for jobs, and then 10
jobs during that week. And then

1231
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:03,409
any additional, like, an- an
additional information, like,

1232
00:55:03,409 --> 00:55:05,389
say for

1233
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:06,768
instance, there was, like, a
really good thread about, you

1234
00:55:06,768 --> 00:55:08,147
know,

1235
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:13,128
again, let's can-- keep it in
context, talking about resumes,

1236
00:55:13,128 --> 00:55:14,838
you know? Like, I'll- I'll- I'll
share that, anything that's a

1237
00:55:14,838 --> 00:55:16,548
part of

1238
00:55:16,548 --> 00:55:18,633
the hashtag. So I won't, like,
go searching for stuff. But

1239
00:55:18,633 --> 00:55:20,718
anything

1240
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:22,129
that's a part of the hashtag,
you know, that got retweeted

1241
00:55:22,129 --> 00:55:23,539
by-- with

1242
00:55:23,543 --> 00:55:27,378
the hashtag, I'll- I'll add that
to the newsletter, and so on and

1243
00:55:27,378 --> 00:55:32,118
so forth. And, you know, it's
really just kind of been about--

1244
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:37,773
just trying to be, like, make
it-- make that-- make the whole

1245
00:55:37,773 --> 00:55:41,704
thing about either job searching
or transitioning-- just job

1246
00:55:41,704 --> 00:55:47,253
related stuff, make it easier,
you know? Especially-- so, like,

1247
00:55:47,259 --> 00:55:49,919
the- the- the thing about
Twitter is, like, when you go on

1248
00:55:49,919 --> 00:55:52,579
LinkedIn

1249
00:55:52,608 --> 00:55:57,289
or when you apply for a job in
any-- in any-- in any, I guess,

1250
00:55:57,318 --> 00:56:02,358
standard way, right? You up- you
upload your- your- your resume

1251
00:56:02,364 --> 00:56:04,041
and so on and so forth. It's
very likely that you won't

1252
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:05,718
necessarily

1253
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:08,358
get seen by a human for whatever
reason. I'm not even gonna get

1254
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:10,969
into that. But for whatever
reason, you may not necessarily

1255
00:56:10,974 --> 00:56:14,928
get seen by a human, you know?
Or-- I don't wanna say that. For

1256
00:56:14,929 --> 00:56:17,719
whatever reason, you won't
interact with a human, I should

1257
00:56:18,123 --> 00:56:21,333
say, you know? You may get some
automated email saying you were

1258
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:26,884
rejected or you may not even get
a reply at all, right? But, you

1259
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,939
know, for Tech is Hiring,
because most of the times I'm

1260
00:56:28,939 --> 00:56:30,994
retweeting

1261
00:56:30,994 --> 00:56:34,684
tweets that somebody else made,
you know, a lot of the times

1262
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:37,925
that person, and a lot of the
times it's a person —

1263
00:56:38,014 --> 00:56:42,244
legitimate person — that person
is now kind of your- your

1264
00:56:42,244 --> 00:56:44,403
interactor-- no. The- the-- your
point of contact for that

1265
00:56:44,403 --> 00:56:46,562
company. So, say

1266
00:56:46,563 --> 00:56:49,563
for instance, let's- let's go
with AWS. A lot of people

1267
00:56:49,563 --> 00:56:52,204
actually, when they-- when
they're-- when they're sharing

1268
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:53,809
job, they'll say, "Hey," you
know, like, in it's-- in

1269
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:55,414
particular cases,

1270
00:56:55,414 --> 00:56:57,783
they'll say, "I'll- I'll
definitely ..." not-- what's--

1271
00:56:57,783 --> 00:57:00,152
not sponsors. The--

1272
00:57:00,273 --> 00:57:04,369
what's the phrase? When they
recommend-- they-- they'll

1273
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:10,219
recommend you, you know? And so
you have that, excuse me, you

1274
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:15,648
have that point of contact with
the organization, you know,

1275
00:57:15,648 --> 00:57:20,418
and, like, for- for- for getting
hired. Like, having somebody

1276
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:24,164
recommend you, you know?
Especially, like, a big person

1277
00:57:24,193 --> 00:57:28,603
recommending you is a huge deal,
you know? And for, like--

1278
00:57:28,603 --> 00:57:30,448
especially for- for younger
engineers, they don't

1279
00:57:30,448 --> 00:57:32,293
necessarily

1280
00:57:32,293 --> 00:57:35,173
have that network to have
somebody recommend them for a

1281
00:57:35,173 --> 00:57:37,423
job. You know what I mean? And
so, you know, when somebody

1282
00:57:37,423 --> 00:57:39,673
posts

1283
00:57:39,673 --> 00:57:43,873
that, you know, their job is
looking for a- a position and

1284
00:57:44,304 --> 00:57:47,384
somebody sees that, they can go
and just reach out to them. They

1285
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:50,206
can send them a DM or they can
send them a reply. And, like,

1286
00:57:50,206 --> 00:57:53,028
that-

1287
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:55,233
that interaction is
significantly better. That--

1288
00:57:55,233 --> 00:57:57,108
even if you're qual-

1289
00:57:57,168 --> 00:57:59,418
I mean, to be fair, if you're
qualified for the job, you're

1290
00:57:59,418 --> 00:58:02,869
qualified for the job. But just
having that kind of point of

1291
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:04,339
contact, you know? Maybe it's
not the job for you, but you

1292
00:58:04,339 --> 00:58:05,809
don't

1293
00:58:05,809 --> 00:58:07,489
know that, you know? You're not
gonna know that until you

1294
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:10,728
interview. So you can sit down
and talk with them, you know?

1295
00:58:10,733 --> 00:58:15,259
Like, just having that point of
contact is so important, you

1296
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:19,338
know? So, like, that's kind of
the real value of Tech is Hiring

1297
00:58:19,338 --> 00:58:22,909
currently is. It's not even
necessarily the resources that

1298
00:58:22,914 --> 00:58:27,858
get shared. It's the resources
and the people who actually

1299
00:58:27,864 --> 00:58:31,128
share them and your ability to
interact with them, you know?

1300
00:58:31,128 --> 00:58:34,398
That's really the- the- the main
thing about Tech is Hiring.

1301
00:58:35,074 --> 00:58:37,114
Bekah: That's so great. Thanks
for sharing that with us, Chad.

1302
