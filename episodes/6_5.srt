features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:21,230
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,639
their

7
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:25,850
coding journey. And they're here

00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,140
stories and what they've
learned. And we are here to

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,430
share it with

10
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:30,830
you here with me. Today is my
co-host.

11
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:39,831
Dan: What up Beck? How is it
going today?

12
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:43,191
Bekah: Just never know, never
know what, how you're going to

13
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:49,070
deliver that. Um, it is, is
going amazingly fantastic today.

14
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:53,128
Dan: that is impressive. Um,
That's good. Cuz uh, today we

15
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:55,625
had

16
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,295
an amazingly fantastic guest,
uh, Chad Stewart.

17
00:00:58,731 --> 00:00:59,810
Bekah: Who is also awesome.

18
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:01,625
Dan: He is also awesome. Yeah,
we that's obvious because he is

19
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,974
on

20
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:04,445
our podcast. So like,

21
00:01:04,445 --> 00:01:05,676
Bekah: Yeah, it was implied.

22
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:09,275
Dan: at this point. Yeah. Uh,
but yeah, he's a Chad's software

23
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:13,865
engineer from Kingston, Jamaica,
and um, yeah, we had a good time

24
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,135
talking to him and he talked a
lot about his experience with

25
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:20,135
open source and um, also his. I
don't know what you call it.

26
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:23,135
He's

27
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:25,536
got a newsletter in his surf
project. Yeah. Called, uh, Tech

28
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:27,920
is Hiring. And, um, I, he told
us a lot about, a lot about that

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,304
and

30
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:32,585
how, how he got into that. And
you know, how it works and stuff

31
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:33,066
is, is very.

32
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:34,911
Bekah: Yeah, I love how
organically it started. You

33
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:36,066
know,

34
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:40,626
he saw a need for something that
in the wider tech industry. And

35
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:43,715
then somebody mentioned to him
like, Hey, what do you think

36
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:45,860
about doing something more with
this? And he just went with

37
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,005
that.

38
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:49,415
And I think that's a really
great way to find inspiration

39
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:50,824
and

40
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:52,475
energy from the things that
you're doing.

41
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,495
Dan: Absolutely. Um, I mean,
it's always good to talk to

42
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,290
Chad. He's

43
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,355
he's very funny. He's, he's one
of our, uh, main contributors to

44
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:06,575
our humor channel in, in, in our
slack. Um, and yeah, it was

45
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:09,725
fascinating hearing about his,
uh, his experience with all that

46
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:11,705
stuff. And with, uh, the Open
Sauced, that was the other,

47
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:13,010
that's the big project that he
volunteers with contributes

48
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,315
with.

49
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:18,485
And, um, he talked a lot about
how you don't have to be writing

50
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:23,015
code to contribute to an open
source project. And I both agree

51
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:24,665
with that. very much and, and
appreciate the, the way he

52
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:26,315
talked

53
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:27,366
about his experiences.

54
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:30,380
Bekah: Yeah. Uh, and we start
this episode of the podcast.

55
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,984
Like

56
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,866
we start every Virtual Coffee.
We introduce ourselves with our

57
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:37,776
name, where we're from, what we
do and a random checking

58
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:49,097
question. We hope you enjoy this
episode. Our random check-in

59
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:50,942
question is if you could have
any animal for a pet, what would

60
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:52,787
it

61
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:52,997
be?

62
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:54,187
Chad: Uh, Cheetah.

63
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:56,956
Bekah: not yet.

64
00:02:57,676 --> 00:02:57,977
Chad: Oh,

65
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:00,887
Bekah: And how is it not a
penguin? That's what I wanna

66
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:01,037
know.

67
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,551
Chad: uh, I like Cheetahs. It'd
be Cheetah or a Peregrine

68
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,796
Falcon.

69
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:07,157
Those are my favorite animals.

70
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:10,597
Bekah: All right. Um, my name is
Bekah. I am a technical

71
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:12,592
community

72
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,372
builder from a small town in
Ohio. And if I could have any

73
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:24,382
animal for a pet, I really like,
um, red pandas and ring-tailed

74
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:29,662
lemurs. So those are on the top
of the list, but a Falcon seems

75
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:31,597
like it would be pretty cool.
I've already got a skinny pig.

76
00:03:31,597 --> 00:03:33,532
So

77
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:37,252
I feel like half of my dreams
have been fulfilled already.

78
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:41,373
Dan: Um, yeah, that thing is
horrifying.

79
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:42,979
Bekah: cute. It's adorable.

80
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:45,334
Dan: It's not, they're supposed
to have fur

81
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:49,758
Bekah: uh, it doesn't, it
doesn't have fur. It's a tiny

82
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:52,818
hippopotamus. So if you're not
familiar with what a skinny pig

83
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:56,299
is, it is a hairless Guinea pig
that looks like a tiny hippo.

84
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:02,899
Super cute. Google. It, it is so
cute. Dan, stop it. Stop hating

85
00:04:02,903 --> 00:04:03,588
on my pet

86
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:05,824
Dan: I mean, this is from a
person who likes the hairless

87
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:06,153
cats

88
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:07,188
Bekah: love hairless

89
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:09,183
Dan: they're like the most
horrifying thing in the world,

90
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:10,113
Bekah: No, they're not. They're
so great. Especially when

91
00:04:10,113 --> 00:04:10,938
they're

92
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:12,889
angry looking, they're just like
great.

93
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:24,814
Dan: that um, okay. Hi, I'm Dan.
I am a developer of. Computer

94
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:31,353
things. uh, I live in Cleveland,
Ohio. Um, yeah. So are we

95
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:33,064
sticking with real world
animals?

96
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,403
Bekah: if you want a mini
dragon, you can have one.

97
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:38,148
Dan: A mini dragon? I was gonna
say the dragon guy from The

98
00:04:38,148 --> 00:04:39,782
Never

99
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:42,274
Ending Story, although he is
like a little

100
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:44,264
Chad: File core. Falkor.

101
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:48,588
Dan: yeah. Falkor, uh, I was
gonna say, um, What's the word

102
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,568
for like, when you, when a
person like a, a being can like

103
00:04:50,568 --> 00:04:52,548
talk and

104
00:04:52,548 --> 00:04:53,238
think and stuff.

105
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:55,434
Bekah: Amorphism.

106
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:58,174
Dan: no. Like a, like a
conscious or, you know, like he

107
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,769
has, he's a

108
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:02,539
little too much of a human, not
a human, but like a thinking

109
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,309
thing

110
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:05,358
to be like, have a,

111
00:05:05,374 --> 00:05:07,274
Bekah: he's an anthropomorphized

112
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,978
Dan: but I'm saying, like, I'm
saying, like, since

113
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:11,869
Chad: a taxpayer to me, to be
honest with

114
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:13,819
Dan: there's a word, there's a
word for what I'm looking for.

115
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,491
And I, I can't think of the
word, but. What I mean is like,

116
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:17,163
I would

117
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:19,803
feel bad keeping him as a pet
because he has like too much of

118
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:21,318
his own, you know,
consciousness, you know what I

119
00:05:21,318 --> 00:05:22,833
mean? Like he

120
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:25,504
like talks and he is like his
own thing. So I don't think he'd

121
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:27,454
wanna be a pet. And that would
make me sad. Um,

122
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:28,563
Bekah: Well, like what about
dogs that run away all the time?

123
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:29,598
Did

124
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:31,608
they really wanna be pet? Should
they be free too?

125
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:39,004
Dan: I mean, I don't know. uh, I
mean, that's a good question.

126
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:42,153
Should any pets be pets? You
know? Yeah. Yeah.

127
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:43,699
Bekah: one of those moral
conundrums.

128
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:47,644
Dan: if you truly love it, then
set it free and it'll come back

129
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:48,994
or something. how does that go?

130
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:51,769
Bekah: if it comes back, it's
yours and that's how you know

131
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:56,149
that is lyrics in a Christine
Aguilar song. I refrain from

132
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:57,199
singing it for you.

133
00:05:57,363 --> 00:05:59,703
Dan: uh, oh man. All right. Um,
anyway, that's my answer. I'm

134
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:02,043
I'm

135
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:04,613
going, if we have to stick with
real world, I'd say sloth though

136
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:07,983
sloths are really cool and you
know, I'd, I'd like, I'd totally

137
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:09,708
like just chill in the backyard
with the. If it's real world

138
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,433
real

139
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:12,874
world animal. That's that's my
answer.

140
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:14,868
Bekah: I was in Costa Rica when
I was like 19 or 20, and that

141
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,352
was a

142
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:19,153
highlight to get, to see the
three toed and the two toed

143
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:19,483
sloths.

144
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:20,524
Dan: Oh yeah. Nice.

145
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:23,014
Bekah: just welcome, Chad.

146
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:24,423
Dan: yeah, go ahead, Chad.

147
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:28,983
Chad: Yeah. So I'm Chad Stewart.
I'm a software engineer, um, in,

148
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:32,524
currently in Kingston, Jamaica,
uh, mostly do front end

149
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:37,084
engineering stuff. Um, right now
though, I'm hopefully

150
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:40,264
transitioning to doing more full
stack stuff. And I guess I

151
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:42,634
answered this earlier, but it
would be either a Cheetah or

152
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,599
Peregrine Falcon. Those are my
favorite animals. They're fast.

153
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:46,564
I

154
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:51,423
like fast animals. I don't know.
Yeah. And I like birds. um,

155
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:56,074
which, uh, Bekah might have,
Bekah alluded to earlier, um,

156
00:06:56,074 --> 00:06:58,894
with a different type of bird.
Um, but

157
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,408
Dan: Yeah. Did you ever read,
uh, either of you ever read, um,

158
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:03,737
My

159
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:04,418
Side of the Mountain.

160
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:05,728
Bekah: Yes.

161
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:06,783
Chad: I, I

162
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,148
Dan: you read that Chad? So it's
a, it's like a, it's like a

163
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:09,453
young

164
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:12,603
adult book, I think, but it it's
about a kid who runs away and

165
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,148
goes and lives in the woods,
like with, with nothing, you

166
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:15,573
know, and

167
00:07:15,574 --> 00:07:19,144
teaches himself how to sort of
forage and hunt and fish or

168
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:21,574
whatever. And he eventually like
goes and get like steals a

169
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,004
Falcon

170
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:27,514
baby, uh, from a nest and, and
then like raises it and trains

171
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,524
it. And it becomes his like
friend and stuff. It's really

172
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:32,156
cool. Um, That sounds cool. It
would be, it would be really

173
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:34,788
cool

174
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,968
to have a Falcon as a pet and
like, could just like, hang out

175
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:41,509
with you on your shoulder. Is
that, what do you think you'd do

176
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:43,098
shoulder or just your arm thing?
I

177
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:46,264
Chad: Uh, depends on the Falcon.
I'm, you know, considering the

178
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:47,794
talent, it would probably not
necessarily rest on your

179
00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:49,324
shoulder

180
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:50,824
and rest in your shoulder. You
know

181
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,158
Dan: right, right.

182
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,918
Bekah: Like a very leather
shoulder pad or something.

183
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:58,024
Dan: Yeah. Little contraption
for, to hang out on. Feel like

184
00:07:58,024 --> 00:07:59,598
you'd wanna like, hang, you
know, keep you, keep him with

185
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:01,172
you when,

186
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:03,274
uh, when he is not like, when he
is not cruising around,

187
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:07,488
Bekah: If I am ever famous and I
go to an award show, I'm gonna

188
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:11,569
come with a Falcon on my
shoulder. Just decided it seems

189
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:11,689
like

190
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:13,564
Dan: you're keying a conference,
you should do it there.

191
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:17,298
Bekah: I don't think I have
enough time to, uh, train a

192
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:19,759
Falcon. I've got like three
weeks.

193
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:21,274
Dan: that's not enough time.

194
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:22,668
Bekah: I don't know.

195
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:24,078
Dan: Well, yeah, this episode
will come out after that.

196
00:08:24,078 --> 00:08:25,248
Anyway.

197
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:29,478
So, uh, next time you're the
keynote speaker at a conference.

198
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,639
That'll be you just put that.

199
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:37,083
Bekah: be my thing. Kirk says my
thing is crying while I give

200
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,203
talks. And that is the thing I
would like to not be doing. I

201
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:48,504
would rather be the, the Falcon
shoulder person. welcome. This

202
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:54,288
is, this is the normal intro for
us. Um, And it is a Friday that

203
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:56,208
we are recording on. So, um,
brains don't work on Fridays.

204
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,128
Uh,

205
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:00,004
everybody knows that. So you're
gonna have to bear with us

206
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:01,879
today.

207
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:04,203
Um, but we will, we'll give you
the mic now, so you don't have

208
00:09:04,203 --> 00:09:06,108
to

209
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:09,349
listen to me talk anymore. We
always love to hear your origin

210
00:09:09,354 --> 00:09:11,031
story. How did you come into
tech and get to this point in

211
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:12,708
your

212
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:13,249
tech journey?

213
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:17,013
Chad: Uh, yeah, so, um, I guess
I give a kind of quick synopsis

214
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:19,593
of,

215
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:26,614
of what I did. Uh, so I moved to
the United States, um, for some

216
00:09:26,614 --> 00:09:28,571
time, uh, To be honest, to, to
go to art school because I

217
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:30,528
wanted to

218
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,688
be a, a game developer and I,
but I couldn't draw very well at

219
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:34,848
the

220
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:38,599
time. So I ended up into another
program, which effectively was

221
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:42,168
web design. Um, whatever the, it
was the art Institute of Fort

222
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:45,438
Lauderdale, it was whatever they
had kind of called web design.

223
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:49,009
And I did that for some time
graduated and then phoned. I

224
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:53,479
didn't necessarily like web
design. Or at least what it was

225
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:56,088
at the time. And so I ended up
going back to another school.

226
00:09:56,088 --> 00:09:58,697
Uh,

227
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:02,269
I'm pretty sure the south IANS
would kind of know the schools

228
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,389
that I'm talking about. Well,
people know art Institute, but,

229
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,259
um, for the south IANS, uh, I
went back to NSU, Nova

230
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,523
Southeastern university, got a,
a software engineering degree

231
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:13,787
from

232
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:19,908
there. And then did some work
ended up returning home, um, and

233
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:24,469
have been kind of working around
ever since. Um, during the

234
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:29,734
pandemic I was unemployed. And
that's how I came across, you

235
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:33,933
know, Bekah and Dan and Virtual
Coffee, um, when they were, when

236
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,443
they were hosting, well, they're
still hosting. Um, they're still

237
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:39,498
hosting zoom, um, zoom calls,
but that's how I came across

238
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:41,553
them.

239
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:48,423
And I've mostly been kind of
active on Twitter. Um, so I, I,

240
00:10:48,423 --> 00:10:53,076
you know, I met, I met Dan and,
and Bekah during 2020, um, 20,

241
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:59,614
20, 20, 21. Um, I decided. To
start an organization, uh, call

242
00:10:59,614 --> 00:11:04,984
Tech is Hiring, um, tech pretty
much. What I do is I retweet job

243
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:10,984
opportunities as I come across
them on Twitter. Um, and I re re

244
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:15,484
I also retweet, um, people
looking for, for opportunities.

245
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:18,394
And so. I've been doing that for
about, for, for a little bit

246
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:20,764
over

247
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,343
a year now. And yeah, like
that's pretty much it. We, we do

248
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:25,922
have,

249
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:31,563
we, uh, have some presence on
LinkedIn, but mostly still on

250
00:11:31,563 --> 00:11:36,274
Twitter, have a newsletter, uh,
been doing the newsletter thing.

251
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:37,338
Haven't missed a week. I'm
actually pretty happy about

252
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:38,402
that.

253
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:43,879
But, uh, have, have been doing a
newsletter for. Uh, couple of

254
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:47,568
months now, I think over six
months now. And yeah, that's

255
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:51,769
pretty much me. I'm, I'm working
now, you know, thankfully and my

256
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:56,089
opportunities are increasing
because of the amount of work

257
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,239
that I've been doing and people
I've been reaching out to and so

258
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:03,828
on and so forth. But yeah. Um,
yeah, it's pretty much me right

259
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:04,009
now.

260
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:08,193
Bekah: That's awesome. And we're
gonna dive into Tech is Hiring a

261
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:11,464
little bit more, but before we
jump into that, I know that

262
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,888
you've been doing, you know, a
lot of different community

263
00:12:12,888 --> 00:12:14,312
things

264
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:17,494
and some of that's been open
source work. Do you wanna talk

265
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:19,653
about what you've been doing
with open source and how you've,

266
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:21,812
uh,

267
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:22,984
been a contributor as well?

268
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:28,833
Chad: Uh, yes. Uh, yes. So, um,
I recently started open source

269
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:33,394
doing more open source work. Um,
uh, funny enough, I started with

270
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:37,653
the. The, um, the open source
project that I had started with,

271
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:42,874
um, which is open source by, uh,
Brian Douglas, um, at B Dougie

272
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:45,949
on, on Twitter. Um, and he
honestly, he approached me to

273
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:49,024
ask

274
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:53,793
me to, to, to, to, to contribute
to his project. And I did. Um,

275
00:12:53,823 --> 00:13:01,234
but I didn't stay initially
mostly because of just all other

276
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:04,016
stuff that I kind of had going
on. At the time. Um, but he

277
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,798
again

278
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:09,738
approached me later. Um, he
again approached me later that

279
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:12,678
year,

280
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,643
uh, really late in the year,
mostly because of Tech is

281
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:16,368
Hiring.

282
00:13:16,668 --> 00:13:20,178
And then he, you know, he wants
to wanted me to, to come on to,

283
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:26,328
to contribute more, um, More
again, and that's what I've been

284
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:31,249
kind of doing, um, for the last
couple of months. And you know,

285
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:34,083
his, his project is pretty much
about kind of having it, it

286
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,917
being

287
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:40,668
a platform of, of people, you
know, transitioning into

288
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:43,113
contributing for open source.
Um, it's in a bit of, uh, I

289
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,558
don't

290
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:51,739
wanna call it limbo, but if the
kind of scope is Evolv. At this

291
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:55,548
point. Um, so, you know, we're,
we're all kind of trying to

292
00:13:55,548 --> 00:14:03,318
figure it OT recently, uh, left
GitHub to, to work on, on open

293
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:09,129
source fulltime. And so. You
know, as he does that, and he's

294
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:13,359
putting a lot more like of his
full, you know, effort into it.

295
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:15,549
He's been, uh, he's been kind of
expanding on that and I've

296
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:17,739
really

297
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:19,388
been helping, uh, here and
there. So like for instance, one

298
00:14:19,388 --> 00:14:21,037
of the

299
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:24,369
things that I did, I'm pretty
kind of happy about this is that

300
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:27,698
the, the, the onboarding
experience for open source was.

301
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:33,229
Was a little bit disjointed and,
you know, he had managed to, to,

302
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:37,249
to get some designs, um, and to
just kind of change the

303
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:40,969
onboarding experience. And that
was like one of the first major

304
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:47,688
things that had helped him with,
um, when I started contributing

305
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:52,609
more often and, you know, been
doing it. For I've been working

306
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,599
on the project ever since. Uh,
it there's two projects. There's

307
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:01,009
open source, the, the, the app,
the, the, the regular app. And

308
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:05,089
then you have hot open source,
which is like a, a, a, a, a,

309
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:10,399
another, not a child app, but
just that app alongside of it, I

310
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:12,889
haven't been working with hot
open sauce, but yeah, that's

311
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:15,634
pretty much what I've been
doing. And, you know, you

312
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:18,379
interact with

313
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:23,149
the community, you know, you get
to talk to you, you, you talk to

314
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:25,218
people here and there, like, so
it is kind of interesting

315
00:15:25,218 --> 00:15:27,287
because

316
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:29,448
he has a, he has a discord,
which I, I interact with a few

317
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:31,608
times,

318
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:34,849
but. To be honest, a lot of the
interactions kind of come, come

319
00:15:34,849 --> 00:15:36,799
through his stream. Uh, I feel
like a lot of people just kind

320
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,749
of

321
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:40,203
come there. And then there's
also times where he'll have like

322
00:15:40,203 --> 00:15:41,657
a

323
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:45,769
call on his discord and, you
know, that's where you, you have

324
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:48,408
some really interesting
conversations, you know, about

325
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:50,013
the project and about kind of
how it's evolving, but just

326
00:15:50,013 --> 00:15:51,618
generally

327
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:55,339
about software engineering. I
think that's like in terms of,

328
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,369
um, in terms of open source,
that's the thing that I kind of

329
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:03,349
want. I I really think is the
most important is your kind of

330
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:07,219
access to information that you
wouldn't regularly have, or not

331
00:16:07,219 --> 00:16:10,788
even necessarily access, because
if you've heard these terms,

332
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:14,778
you've heard a lot of the.
Technologies and stuff. You

333
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:16,203
probably, you can Google them
or, you know, they're, they're

334
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:17,628
that

335
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:22,308
open, but like the likelihood of
you coming across that as

336
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:25,578
somebody who's just not in the
know, you know, is very

337
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:28,759
difficult. And I think that's
like the, the key thing that,

338
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:33,484
that open source has been. Um,
helping me with is just coming

339
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:38,104
across these technologies and
these people and, you know, just

340
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:41,524
getting to know them, you know,
even if it's still more of a

341
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,124
passive LA, not passive, but as
a, I don't know the person

342
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:47,313
directly, or I don't know, I
haven't interacted with the

343
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:49,863
technology, but just having them
as like in your Rolodex of

344
00:16:49,863 --> 00:16:52,413
things

345
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:55,293
that you could leverage, you
know, is extraordinarily.

346
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:59,433
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. I love
that. And I love Brian Douglas

347
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:01,098
too. He's pretty awesome. I
actually, uh, he's gonna be

348
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:02,763
doing

349
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:07,263
a lunch and learn at Virtual
Coffee, um, which is super

350
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:11,253
exciting. We're gonna talk about
open source and open sauce and

351
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:13,608
Octoberfest. So that'll be
coming up in September. I'm

352
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:15,963
really glad

353
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:21,588
to. Um, have him getting us in
the, in the mind frame of

354
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:26,298
prepping to do some open source
contribution because that's I,

355
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:29,719
the beginning kind of, of the
Virtual Coffee, origin story,

356
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:33,558
maybe. Um, it's not the first
thing that we did, but, uh, it

357
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:38,148
was the first time I felt like
Virtual Coffee was gonna be an

358
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:42,888
organization that outlasts the
pandemic. Um, I thought for a

359
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:45,989
long time that it was like, Hey,
we're. Get together and

360
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:49,949
everybody's feeling isolated.
And then we did Oktoberfest, our

361
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:51,931
first Octoberfest initiative,
and everybody was just so

362
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:53,909
excited

363
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:55,949
about it and contributing. And
we had maintainers and

364
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,989
contributors

365
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:02,614
and lots of mentorship and
support, and it was. It was fun,

366
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:07,233
but really gratifying to see
people contributing and learning

367
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,628
and growing through that
experience. And, you know, it

368
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:10,023
can

369
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:13,173
be, it can be scary to get
involved and do your first

370
00:18:13,173 --> 00:18:16,923
contribution. Um, even if you've
been in tech, we had a number of

371
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:19,324
people who have been in tech for
a while, and I've never done an

372
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:20,976
open source contribution. So,
you know, what advice do you

373
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,624
have for

374
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:26,344
folks who are maybe a little bit
nervous about entering that open

375
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:27,394
source experience?

376
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:32,808
Chad: Uh, that's a, that's a
really interesting question. Um,

377
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,743
Hmm. What advice would I give?
So I would say, um, find

378
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:41,567
community,

379
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:45,161
you know, like that. So the,
the, the. The open source

380
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:48,303
projects

381
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:54,094
that I would definitely look,
look to, um, are open source

382
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:58,953
projects that are very much not
just about the, the, the

383
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,221
contributions, but you know,
like the, the, whatever you kind

384
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:03,483
of

385
00:19:03,513 --> 00:19:07,294
deliver, whatever you merge, you
know, but significantly more

386
00:19:07,294 --> 00:19:12,798
about the community of people.
Um, and just kind of the culture

387
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,909
around the, the, the open source
project, like that's really

388
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:21,469
important, you know, like there
are a lot of there, you know,

389
00:19:21,469 --> 00:19:24,258
people give the advice of, of,
you know, contribute to like

390
00:19:24,258 --> 00:19:27,047
you,

391
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:28,716
you, their tools that you use
all the time, like react and so

392
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:30,378
on

393
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:34,503
and so forth, you know, you want
to contribute to those and. You

394
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:37,263
know, some of them are hit and
miss, but a lot of the times

395
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:44,493
they're so big that they they're
really hard to get into, you

396
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:46,623
know, like I, I wanted to, I,
you know, I heard the whole

397
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:48,753
thing.

398
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:49,923
It's like, you should, you
should contribute to open

399
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,093
source. It's

400
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:54,394
great. And so I was like, okay,
I'll contribute to open source.

401
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,824
You know, which, which product
I'm going to try, I'm gonna try

402
00:19:56,824 --> 00:19:58,518
to contribute to react. There's
a bunch of good first issues

403
00:19:58,518 --> 00:20:00,212
there.

404
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:04,804
And I was just. What you know
what I mean? Like, I couldn't

405
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,013
understand anything that they
were asking, and this was like a

406
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:11,614
couple of years back and I, you
know, I tried it a few times and

407
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:14,703
I was just like, I'm gonna go do
something else. You know what I

408
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:17,493
mean? So it's like really
important to kind of have that

409
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:21,663
community, like have, have those
people being very welcoming, you

410
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:26,068
know, having the discord, like a
lot of. The secondary stuff to

411
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:31,259
the, to the, to the actual
working code and tools is, is

412
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:33,448
really important. Um, the second
thing, and I'm, I'm really

413
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:35,637
happy.

414
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:38,176
I remember this. The second
thing is that you don't

415
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:40,708
necessarily

416
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:44,673
have to contribute code. You
know, it's not just about code,

417
00:20:44,673 --> 00:20:46,428
there's a lot of other things
that you can contribute, and

418
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:48,183
that

419
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:51,993
would be a contribution to open
source, like contributing, uh,

420
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:55,923
documentation, you know, like I
know, uh, uh, Brian for, for

421
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:59,823
open

422
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:02,253
source, he has a triage team
for, for triaging issues. I

423
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:04,682
believe

424
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:13,384
that's, um, like. You know, find
you taking, I'm sorry if I'm, I

425
00:21:13,384 --> 00:21:17,223
hope I'm getting this right. But
like you, you take when, when

426
00:21:17,223 --> 00:21:20,523
there's issues, you know, you
kind of scope them out so that

427
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:22,368
there's something that somebody
can easily take on. And I

428
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,152
believe

429
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:29,763
he got that idea from the node,
from node, which nodes, from my

430
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:31,728
understanding. For the longest
time, I really wanted to join

431
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:33,693
the

432
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:36,063
open source community for node
because they seemed so

433
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:38,433
welcoming.

434
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:40,863
You know, they seemed to have
all of this kind of

435
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:43,233
infrastructure in

436
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:48,328
place for a new person to come
in and. Really be able to

437
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:50,473
contribute, you know, like I
don't remember exactly

438
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:52,618
everything

439
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:53,833
that they have now, but like
they have, you know, they have

440
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,048
stuff

441
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:58,019
on YouTube. They have them weak,
they have weekly meetings on

442
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:00,328
YouTube, you know, like they
have like this whole community

443
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:02,637
around

444
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:05,068
joining them. And so I'll try
not to go into the community

445
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:07,498
thing

446
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:09,714
again, but like, there are a lot
of things that you can do to.

447
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:11,929
You

448
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:13,488
know, like you can contribute
documentation, like for, for,

449
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:15,047
for

450
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:18,618
the no project. Like, I believe
you can do something like just

451
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:21,288
kind of help managing the
meetings that they have because

452
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:23,703
they regularly have meetings,
but there are a lot of outside

453
00:22:23,703 --> 00:22:25,878
things

454
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:28,188
outside of like literally
writing the code that needs to

455
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:30,498
go into

456
00:22:30,503 --> 00:22:35,209
the project that can go, that
can go in there and people have

457
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:40,413
literally gotten opportu. From
contributing to open source, um,

458
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,648
open source projects in these
auxiliary ways, you know? And

459
00:22:42,648 --> 00:22:44,853
so.

460
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:47,778
I would, so the thing that I
would definitely stress is

461
00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:50,989
community. You know, like
community is extraordinarily

462
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:55,219
important, you know, having
people to have your back, you

463
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:58,578
know, when you're contributing
is really important, to be quite

464
00:22:58,584 --> 00:23:02,628
honest, I would say that it's
much more important to, to, to

465
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:05,358
build and maintain those
relationships than it is to

466
00:23:05,358 --> 00:23:07,211
contribute the code. In my
opinion. It's much more

467
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:09,064
important

468
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:10,474
to have those relationships. In
fact, I would say that's the

469
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:11,884
most

470
00:23:11,884 --> 00:23:14,344
important thing about open
source and that it's not just

471
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:16,804
about

472
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:21,153
contributing code. You don't
need to contribute code it. It's

473
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:23,178
about, you can contribute in, in
your own way, just reach out.

474
00:23:23,178 --> 00:23:25,173
And

475
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:27,066
there might be things that,
that, you know, that the, the,

476
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:28,953
the

477
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,854
maintainer needs and, you know,
you may be able to help help

478
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:34,878
there, but just, I guess, to
kind of sum up at the very least

479
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:36,902
the

480
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:39,933
last part is just be very open
ended on how you, how you'd like

481
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:42,903
to contribute to the community.
You know, like you don't

482
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:45,153
necessarily have to contribute
something that, you know, gets

483
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:47,181
merged into a poll request.
Yeah, but just be very open

484
00:23:47,181 --> 00:23:49,209
minded on

485
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:52,749
how you'd contribute to the
community, to, to that community

486
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:55,088
and focus on community. You
know, even if it's a small

487
00:23:55,088 --> 00:23:57,398
community,

488
00:23:57,398 --> 00:24:01,598
just focus on the relationships
that you're building with with

489
00:24:01,598 --> 00:24:04,689
these people. It's not just
about, you know, you write

490
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:08,108
something and then you merge
requests and then you, you know,

491
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:11,378
you go off somewhere, you know,
it's about building those

492
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:15,269
relationships. You know, that,
that's what I would say. Sorry

493
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:15,509
for cutting.

494
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:18,903
Bekah: no, no. I love that. I
love focusing, especially for

495
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:22,084
first time contributors on that
interaction on the community

496
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:26,433
building of things, because
getting into open source can be

497
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:30,574
really nerve-wracking or seem
really hard to do, but you're

498
00:24:30,574 --> 00:24:33,544
right. If you find that right
community, it makes it a lot

499
00:24:33,548 --> 00:24:36,394
easier for you and you are
building those relationships.

500
00:24:36,723 --> 00:24:39,155
And, you know, if we look at
even some of the larger. Open

501
00:24:39,155 --> 00:24:41,587
source

502
00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:45,759
projects. Sometimes, sometimes
there's a need for smaller

503
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,844
contributions or sometimes their
first time contributor issues

504
00:24:47,844 --> 00:24:49,929
are

505
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:52,929
exactly like what you were
talking about. Like, I have no

506
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:56,499
idea what you're talking about.
This is not for me. And then

507
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:59,753
that's okay. You know, there are
other. Opportunities out there.

508
00:24:59,993 --> 00:25:02,693
And this is one of my pet peeves
where people are like, this is

509
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:05,513
not in the spirit of hack Tober
Fest. And they wanna say like,

510
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:07,733
oh, you can't make a
contribution that looks like

511
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:09,713
this or that just

512
00:25:09,713 --> 00:25:15,338
changes one thing. Um, and I, I
think that. Maybe that's how you

513
00:25:15,338 --> 00:25:17,453
feel about your project, but
that doesn't necessarily apply

514
00:25:17,453 --> 00:25:19,568
to

515
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:22,568
other people's projects. There
are a lot of projects out there

516
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:26,709
that are community run that are
people who are trying to

517
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,489
collaborate and work together
and support other people. So

518
00:25:28,489 --> 00:25:30,269
there

519
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:34,118
are lots of different projects,
there's different approaches to

520
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:38,318
open source contribution and
finding that community that's

521
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:41,138
going to support you is going to
help you to make that

522
00:25:41,548 --> 00:25:41,949
contribution.

523
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:44,728
Chad: Absolutely. Absolutely
agree. And I'd like to touch on

524
00:25:44,728 --> 00:25:46,078
a

525
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,073
little bit about, you know,
there are a lot of kind of

526
00:25:48,073 --> 00:25:50,068
community

527
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:56,209
run projects. Um, I've been
there. So this is kind of funny.

528
00:25:56,269 --> 00:25:58,428
Uh, I went through this, looking
up a lot of interview prep

529
00:25:58,428 --> 00:26:00,587
stuff.

530
00:26:00,594 --> 00:26:02,496
Cause to be quite honest, I did
a lot of that within the last,

531
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:04,398
not

532
00:26:04,403 --> 00:26:06,275
within the last couple of
months, but, um, years prior I

533
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:08,147
was doing

534
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:11,261
a lot of interview prep and
there are so many kind of. You

535
00:26:11,261 --> 00:26:14,374
know,

536
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:16,354
thing, I don't know if they're
necessarily open source

537
00:26:16,354 --> 00:26:18,334
projects,

538
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:21,723
but they're projects that, you
know, have a that's, you know,

539
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:23,808
open to the world. And, you
know, like as far as I know,

540
00:26:23,808 --> 00:26:25,893
it's not

541
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:30,003
the paid product, you know, I
thinks, yeah. I don't think it's

542
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:33,334
a paid product. Like for
instance, there's, there's the

543
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:36,483
algorithms, which is something
that I just recently found out

544
00:26:36,753 --> 00:26:39,160
about, which. Literally a
project of a bunch of kind of

545
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,567
data

546
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:46,788
structures and algorithms that
you would see in interviews. Um,

547
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:50,689
and it's like a huge kind of log
of them in different languages.

548
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:54,169
You know what I mean? And as far
as I know, that's not a paid

549
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:55,638
product, it's just out there,
you know, and like I was

550
00:26:55,638 --> 00:26:57,107
bookmarking

551
00:26:57,108 --> 00:27:00,019
a bunch of these things, but
there's that, there's that like,

552
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:04,489
there's the, the, the, what you
call it, the tech interview

553
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,114
handbook, which kind of gives
you like a real. You know, it's

554
00:27:07,114 --> 00:27:09,739
a

555
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:13,429
great breakdown of how
interviewing is how you study,

556
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:16,939
you know, what you, what people
are, are looking funny enough.

557
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:21,499
The thing that I, that draw me
to that was, you know, what, you

558
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:25,159
know, there, it described like
how people are, are kind of

559
00:27:25,163 --> 00:27:28,788
looking, looking at you at like
big tech interview group. The

560
00:27:28,788 --> 00:27:31,368
point I'm making is all of those
things. When you look at them on

561
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:35,778
GitHub, they're really just like
marked on. I think they are, but

562
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:38,449
they're, they're not like
anything crazy, you know, you're

563
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:42,979
not like using Redux to, to
display all of this information,

564
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:47,884
you know what I mean? But those
projects like that. Hundreds of

565
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:51,903
contributors and you know, like
you can contribute to that

566
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:55,233
project. Say, say for instance,
you've done a massive amount of

567
00:27:55,233 --> 00:27:58,384
interviewing to, to kind of stay
in context, the ma a massive

568
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:02,223
amount of interviewing and you
feel like there's an issue here.

569
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:06,084
Issue with some of the
information here you could most

570
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,953
definitely reach out or, or, or
apply a change. And I mean, even

571
00:28:09,953 --> 00:28:11,993
then it's like, all of this is
kind of talking about

572
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:13,808
information, right? So, you
know, say there's like typos or

573
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:15,623
it's

574
00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:19,163
just not as clear, you can
definitely just, you know, clear

575
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:24,604
up that information or reach out
to whoever and, and. That isn't

576
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:28,834
necessarily code in the, in, in
the sense that most people think

577
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:31,804
of open source projects. When
people think of open or

578
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:33,663
contributing to open source
projects, they think about

579
00:28:33,663 --> 00:28:35,522
adding

580
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:42,213
a feature or refactoring very
much like code, you know, very

581
00:28:42,213 --> 00:28:47,493
much. Like that very particular
use case when there's, like I

582
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:49,806
said, there's a whole breadth of
things that you can, you can,

583
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:52,113
you

584
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:56,284
can do. And I mean, we're, we're
even, even this conversation,

585
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:59,919
we're kind of talking about the
at least. The way I'm kind of

586
00:28:59,923 --> 00:29:03,038
thinking about it is like, if
you're doing open source, you're

587
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:06,308
literally on GitHub, you
literally go to the project and

588
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:09,489
then it's just like, however,
right. But, you know, if you're,

589
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,209
if the, the open source project
has a community, you know, you

590
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:17,378
may not necessarily even be on
GitHub. You know, like you could

591
00:29:17,384 --> 00:29:20,528
be, you could be a part of their
discord and you could be like

592
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:23,558
moderating their discord and
something like that, you know,

593
00:29:23,648 --> 00:29:26,648
like that's still contr, um,
contributing, you know what I

594
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:32,239
mean? So, I just, I guess I just
wanted to, to, to, to, again,

595
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:36,558
reemphasize that there's a lot
of things that you can do to

596
00:29:36,564 --> 00:29:40,909
contribute to community. You
know, like it's, again, it's not

597
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:44,739
just writing. I want to say
JavaScripts of that. it's not

598
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:47,778
just writing JavaScript, you
know what I mean? It's just not

599
00:29:47,808 --> 00:29:51,949
writing code. Like there's a lot
of ways you can, you can

600
00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:54,266
contribute and. Keeping that
open mind of the, the, the, you

601
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:56,583
know,

602
00:29:56,733 --> 00:30:01,094
the, the needs of the, the, the
maintainer. That's pretty much

603
00:30:01,094 --> 00:30:01,294
it.

604
00:30:01,443 --> 00:30:03,303
Dan: Yeah, I love that. You
know, and, and Virtual Coffee

605
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:05,163
for

606
00:30:05,163 --> 00:30:08,344
example, right. We have lots of
volunteers that are, that help

607
00:30:08,344 --> 00:30:10,038
our community. Um, but also like
our, our site is open source

608
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:11,732
and.

609
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:13,683
I don't know, like 80% of the
files are just content, you

610
00:30:13,683 --> 00:30:14,883
know,

611
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:19,114
they're just, uh, and it, I
suppose it's code technically or

612
00:30:19,114 --> 00:30:21,663
something, you know, but it's
like the, the valuable parts of

613
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:23,673
it are the, are the words,
right. Other content, you know?

614
00:30:23,673 --> 00:30:25,683
And, um,

615
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:28,953
I, I mean, I love that advice. I
think it's great and very

616
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,933
important to keep your mind. And
also it's like sometimes,

617
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:32,451
especially when you get into
docs and stuff like that is

618
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:33,963
sometimes

619
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:38,074
really hard for maintainers to
keep up to date or to make, you

620
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:39,949
know, Uh, like to catch all the
edge cases, uh, things like

621
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:41,824
that.

622
00:30:41,854 --> 00:30:45,094
Um, IU from Virtual Coffee is
really good at this sheet. You

623
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:48,243
know, how many times have you
done, like some install followed

624
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:49,566
the, read me, right. Done some
install thing and it didn't

625
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:50,883
work.

626
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:52,308
And you had to like Google
around and try a couple

627
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,732
different things

628
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:56,554
to get something to work. Right.
And then what I do most of the

629
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,983
time is just, okay, cool. I got
working. I'll just move on. You

630
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,453
know, but how Val, how much,
like, it would be a very easy

631
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:01,923
and

632
00:31:01,923 --> 00:31:04,458
valuable contribution to that,
that project to just go back.

633
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,993
Add

634
00:31:07,054 --> 00:31:08,314
like a, a poll request that just
adds a little note in the read

635
00:31:08,314 --> 00:31:09,574
me

636
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:12,453
that says, Hey, if you run into
this error, try this fix, you

637
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:16,413
know what I mean? Um, and, uh, I
think that's the kind of thing

638
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:19,983
that a lot of people maybe don't
consider right away. Um, but it,

639
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:20,794
I

640
00:31:20,808 --> 00:31:21,933
Bekah: Kinda like that error
that I have running the Virtual

641
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:23,058
Coffee

642
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:25,098
site that I still haven't. done
anything

643
00:31:25,413 --> 00:31:27,064
Dan: right. Well, that's a whole
different yeah.

644
00:31:27,378 --> 00:31:28,939
Bekah: no, that's a Netlify CLI

645
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,549
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. But, but, but
it is the same thing. I mean,

646
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:32,044
like

647
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:35,433
it's, it's the same thing. Like,
okay. Maybe that is something we

648
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:38,013
need to add. Cuz other people,
most people don't have the LF I

649
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:42,423
CLI installed, like to start
and, but you already did. And so

650
00:31:42,423 --> 00:31:46,354
there's something going on and
maybe there's some note we need

651
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:47,959
to add or some parameter to add
to the install steps, you know,

652
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:49,564
I

653
00:31:49,564 --> 00:31:51,723
don't know. I don't know what it
is, but like even just bringing

654
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:54,273
it up in issue, like even
honestly writing an issue is

655
00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:58,084
contributing to an open source.
Like not fixing it, not, not

656
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:00,506
knowing the solution, but just
like logging a problem. It can

657
00:32:00,506 --> 00:32:02,928
be

658
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:06,108
a very valuable contribution to
an open source project because,

659
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,138
uh, most likely the maintainer
doesn't know about it. You know,

660
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:13,759
our maintainers don't know about
it, like the, uh, or they do and

661
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:20,209
they forgot or you know,
anything. Uh, and I, I, I, uh,

662
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:22,548
yeah, I don't know. I, I think
everything you said is, is right

663
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:26,689
and I, I think it's great. Um, I
love that also. I just talk a

664
00:32:26,689 --> 00:32:28,383
little bit more. I love that
idea about, um, helping,

665
00:32:28,383 --> 00:32:30,077
helping, um,

666
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:33,618
Maintainers in areas outside of
CA hub even, and how valuable

667
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,508
that can be. Um, I think, I
think that's another thing that

668
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:37,398
people

669
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:40,128
don't maybe always think about,
but asking maintainers, if they

670
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:44,388
need help outside of writing
code, uh, it can be nice and it

671
00:32:44,388 --> 00:32:47,179
can be nice, nice to like, have
somebody to reach out, reach out

672
00:32:47,183 --> 00:32:50,269
to you too, you know, sometimes
say, Hey, do you need any help

673
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:52,548
with this? Even if, uh, even if
they say no, it's, it's like a

674
00:32:52,548 --> 00:32:54,798
nice, I don't know, nice
gesture.

675
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:55,894
Bekah: Yeah, I,

676
00:32:56,443 --> 00:32:56,923
Chad: Oh, go ahead. Go

677
00:32:57,034 --> 00:32:58,608
Bekah: sorry. I, I gave a talk
on, um, I think it was called,

678
00:32:58,608 --> 00:33:00,182
do

679
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:03,604
you need community? And it was
from the perspective of, uh, if

680
00:33:03,604 --> 00:33:07,354
you are maybe getting into code
or if you are in tech and you

681
00:33:07,354 --> 00:33:10,864
don't have a community. What
would be the reasons and the

682
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:14,223
benefits. And part of that, I
talked about getting involved in

683
00:33:14,223 --> 00:33:15,963
organizations and sometimes
people say like, Hey, do you

684
00:33:15,963 --> 00:33:17,703
need

685
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:20,374
any help? And there's so much
overwhelmed sometimes as a

686
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:22,683
maintainer that it's like, yeah,
but I don't even know where to

687
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:26,673
start. Right. And so being more
specific like, Hey, do you need

688
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:29,253
any help? I'm really good at
building chat bots. And I think

689
00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:32,104
this could be really beneficial,
like giving that specific thing

690
00:33:32,104 --> 00:33:37,298
or, Hey, Like to post on social
media. Can I write some tweets

691
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:39,293
for you? And you know, you're
not getting a green box for

692
00:33:39,293 --> 00:33:41,288
that. And

693
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:45,098
I know that it can be really
hard to feel like, oh, there, I

694
00:33:45,098 --> 00:33:47,739
haven't accomplished anything,
but you've supported a community

695
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:51,608
of people that, that is
supporting other people. So, and

696
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,306
I, I think the. One of the
things I like too about Virtual

697
00:33:53,306 --> 00:33:54,998
Coffee,

698
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:58,838
our members page just keeps
evolving into something better

699
00:33:58,838 --> 00:34:00,668
and better because we have our
members who have to create a

700
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:02,498
pool

701
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:07,209
request to get their profile on
our me members page. But then

702
00:34:07,568 --> 00:34:12,759
last year, the issue was you can
add your social links, um, and

703
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,478
we've updated it with all of our
active volunteers. So, you know,

704
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:20,943
like finding ways to also.
Support the people who are

705
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:24,094
supporting your project in other
ways is incredibly important as

706
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:24,483
well.

707
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:29,938
Chad: I agree. I agree. And, uh,
I also want to kind of reiterate

708
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:34,588
that, like, you know, you, you,
for, for the people who are

709
00:34:34,588 --> 00:34:36,508
actually contributing code,
they, a lot of those people do

710
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,428
that to

711
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:41,909
improve their skills, right. To
come across problems that they

712
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:44,608
generally wouldn't come across
or be more difficult for them to

713
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:48,240
come across. On their own.
Right. But I think the most

714
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,872
important

715
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:57,934
part of open source as a
contributor is to, is that

716
00:34:57,934 --> 00:34:59,839
interaction, the interaction
with people, you know what I

717
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,744
mean? And

718
00:35:01,748 --> 00:35:05,434
so definitely being, having
something where it's like, okay,

719
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:06,903
you reach out to the
maintainers. It's like, Hey, I

720
00:35:06,903 --> 00:35:08,372
can do this.

721
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:11,344
You know, like you were saying,
you know, I can, I can do tweets

722
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:16,099
and so on and so forth. That
interaction is so valuable. And

723
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:18,528
the con that consistency of
interaction is so valuable.

724
00:35:18,528 --> 00:35:20,957
Like,

725
00:35:21,168 --> 00:35:23,958
you'd be surprised you'd be,
you'd be maintaining a project

726
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,248
and there's just somebody who,
you know, you, you know them,

727
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,538
you

728
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:28,716
know, them casually and then
they turn out to be well, 50% of

729
00:35:28,716 --> 00:35:30,893
the

730
00:35:30,893 --> 00:35:35,333
time they turn on to be, you
know, your, your next employer,

731
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,123
because they're now op offering
you an opportunity. Uh, I was

732
00:35:38,123 --> 00:35:39,653
watching a video recently, you
know, I'm just going to be, I

733
00:35:39,653 --> 00:35:41,183
was

734
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:46,284
watching a video from recently
where I don't remember who he

735
00:35:46,284 --> 00:35:49,103
was, who Brian was talking to,
but he was talking about, um,

736
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:51,922
how

737
00:35:51,923 --> 00:35:54,263
we had an open source project
and like, it became more and

738
00:35:54,263 --> 00:35:56,603
more of.

739
00:35:57,844 --> 00:35:59,629
Overall. I don't remember
exactly the, the, the

740
00:35:59,629 --> 00:36:01,414
circumstances, but

741
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:03,633
he, and he started hiring a lot
of people because he had

742
00:36:03,633 --> 00:36:05,672
somebody

743
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:08,224
who was, he had started hiring.
Not a lot of people. He started

744
00:36:08,224 --> 00:36:12,603
hiring from his contributors
because his contributors were

745
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:14,298
very consistent. They were
excellent, you know, in what

746
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:15,903
the,

747
00:36:15,903 --> 00:36:18,903
in their contributions. And he
just, he was just like, Hey, you

748
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:21,153
want to, you want a full time
job? And they were like, yeah,

749
00:36:21,153 --> 00:36:23,876
sure. And that's how they found
their next opportu. You know,

750
00:36:23,876 --> 00:36:26,599
and

751
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:32,119
so. It's really about those
relationships, you know, as a

752
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:33,693
contributor, as a, as a
maintainer, you know, like

753
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:35,267
that's

754
00:36:35,268 --> 00:36:38,329
a, I don't want to talk about
that too much cause that's just

755
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,994
not, I don't have the experience
there, but as a contributor,

756
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:41,659
it's

757
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:45,259
about building those
relationships and like it's just

758
00:36:45,259 --> 00:36:47,534
a different avenue. Of, of
building those relationships

759
00:36:47,534 --> 00:36:49,809
with

760
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:53,228
people and then, you know,
showing that, you know, like, I

761
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:56,588
guess going back to, to coding,
showing that, you know, you can

762
00:36:56,588 --> 00:37:00,039
code, that's like one of the big
issues, the big problems with,

763
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:01,958
with junior developers trying to
get positions is that

764
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,877
effectively

765
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:06,849
they have to prove that they,
they know how to code and they

766
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,423
can just be like, Hey, look at
my contribution to this open

767
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:09,997
source

768
00:37:09,998 --> 00:37:13,119
project that got, you know, that
got merged and is being used in

769
00:37:13,123 --> 00:37:16,864
the project right now and has my
name. You know, I can code, you

770
00:37:16,864 --> 00:37:23,103
know what I mean? Like, so like,
it's just, yeah, it's just, it's

771
00:37:23,103 --> 00:37:25,143
about building those
relationships. Those

772
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,888
relationships will, will
definitely take you far. At

773
00:37:27,888 --> 00:37:30,633
least

774
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:32,193
in my, in my opinion, that's
like one of the biggest things

775
00:37:32,193 --> 00:37:33,752
for,

776
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:33,903
for.

777
00:37:34,324 --> 00:37:35,703
Dan: And not just proving you
can code, but proving that you

778
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:37,082
have

779
00:37:37,143 --> 00:37:38,793
drive and can operate on your
own and things like that as

780
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:40,443
well. Um,

781
00:37:41,313 --> 00:37:45,273
and you're interested in it and,
you know, I think, I think that,

782
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:48,611
uh, sort of. I don't know, a
full, you know, I don't wanna

783
00:37:48,611 --> 00:37:51,739
say

784
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:54,949
like, all the green squares are
green, but like, you know, you

785
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:57,228
know, a full like GitHub profile
where you have a lot of

786
00:37:57,228 --> 00:37:59,268
contributions to some things,
um, can go a really long way,

787
00:37:59,268 --> 00:38:01,308
uh, to

788
00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:05,088
showing that, you know, even if
you're not like, right, like you

789
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:08,809
said, like rewriting the react
code base, you know, like it

790
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:09,964
doesn't have to be like that,
obviously, especially when

791
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:11,119
you're

792
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,778
starting out. Um, but just like
connecting with people and, and.

793
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:17,388
Contributing in. I don't know.
I, I, yeah, I agree. It's can be

794
00:38:17,388 --> 00:38:19,008
a

795
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:21,259
very valuable tool. Um, open
source contribu.

796
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:24,258
Bekah: I know a woman who really
wanted to work with, um, a

797
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:26,763
pretty

798
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:31,293
notable tech organization, but
their interview process was

799
00:38:31,293 --> 00:38:33,588
notoriously hard and she knew
she would not be able to pass

800
00:38:33,588 --> 00:38:35,883
the

801
00:38:35,884 --> 00:38:38,368
interview process. And, you
know, didn't have time to devote

802
00:38:38,368 --> 00:38:40,852
hours

803
00:38:41,103 --> 00:38:44,733
and months of her life to
studying for. And so she started

804
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:46,923
contributing to their open
source project and sure enough,

805
00:38:46,923 --> 00:38:49,113
she got

806
00:38:49,114 --> 00:38:52,143
hired without having to go
through that interview process

807
00:38:52,143 --> 00:38:53,568
because she was familiar with
the code base. They knew that

808
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:54,993
her

809
00:38:54,994 --> 00:38:57,034
work was good and that she
could, could be a part of the

810
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,074
team

811
00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:01,623
because of that community
collaboration that she already

812
00:39:01,623 --> 00:39:03,408
had. So, I mean, not,
everybody's gonna let you, uh,

813
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:05,193
navigate

814
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:08,344
around the interview process,
but it was really, really great

815
00:39:08,344 --> 00:39:12,494
strategy for. You know, not only
learning more yourself, but like

816
00:39:12,494 --> 00:39:16,333
you're saying, finding new
avenues to job opportunities.

817
00:39:17,744 --> 00:39:21,164
Chad: Agreed. Agreed. I actually
was, I don't necessarily have a

818
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:23,101
direct story, but I've
definitely heard of other

819
00:39:23,101 --> 00:39:25,034
people. Who've had

820
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:29,623
similar experiences who they,
they contributed to, to large

821
00:39:29,623 --> 00:39:34,184
open source projects for pretty
well known companies and, you

822
00:39:34,184 --> 00:39:37,818
know, no interview processes
like. We see that you're we see

823
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:40,909
that you can code, we, you know,
we want you to work on this

824
00:39:40,909 --> 00:39:44,418
thing, you know, so they just
brought them on board, you know,

825
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:47,688
it wasn't that it wasn't a big,
crazy thing, you know, they

826
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:51,528
didn't have to study for, for,
for months, like you said, you

827
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:56,809
know? Definitely like, and from
my understanding, that is, that

828
00:39:56,809 --> 00:40:03,289
is not uncommon, you know, like
it's not an uncommon circum. At

829
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:05,553
all, you know, so definitely I
definitely, again, you know,

830
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:07,817
it's

831
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:11,719
about those relationships. It's
about, you know, it's about

832
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,259
building those relationships
with, with, with those, with

833
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:19,369
those people, you know, and even
with other contributors as well,

834
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:23,778
you know, like how, how many
people have, have kind of come,

835
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:26,688
come to Virtual Coffee and have
become friends with each other.

836
00:40:27,173 --> 00:40:31,509
because of kind of their, their,
their meeting at Virtual Coffee

837
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:34,989
or doing work with Virtual
Coffee. You know what I mean? So

838
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:38,739
it's definitely about building
those relationships again, in my

839
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:39,068
opinion.

840
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:41,929
Bekah: Well, and I think too,
one of the great things about

841
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:44,599
contributing to open source is
also learning how to take

842
00:40:44,603 --> 00:40:48,708
feedback because oftentimes, you
know, you've got a PR and it's

843
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:51,259
not going to be perfect. So
you'll be getting some feedback.

844
00:40:51,528 --> 00:40:54,289
Do you have any experience with
that? And, you know, like, has

845
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:57,108
that helped you develop. As a
developer

846
00:40:58,233 --> 00:41:01,353
Chad: Uh, it has definitely not
helped me develop as a developer

847
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:05,103
because that'd be no, I'm just
uh, yeah, I've gotten, I've

848
00:41:05,103 --> 00:41:09,543
definitely gotten feedback. Um,
Like one of the kind of key

849
00:41:09,543 --> 00:41:12,873
things about just being
coachable, you know? And again,

850
00:41:12,963 --> 00:41:18,934
like, because it's a learning
experience, you know, like, I

851
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:22,804
don't wanna say, well, because
it's a learning experience. You

852
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:26,673
should really be happy for
feedback. You know? Like you

853
00:41:26,673 --> 00:41:28,923
don't want somebody to be giving
you feedback where they're like,

854
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:30,528
ha ha you know, and they're just
kind of yelling down. Like

855
00:41:30,528 --> 00:41:32,133
nobody

856
00:41:32,134 --> 00:41:33,768
wants that. You know what I
mean? But if it's like, Hey, I

857
00:41:33,768 --> 00:41:35,402
would

858
00:41:35,403 --> 00:41:39,963
structure it this way. That's
like the key thing about, you

859
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:42,198
know, contributions, right? Like
about open source, right? Like,

860
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:44,433
I

861
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:47,164
don't wanna say it's judgment
free again, you know, it depends

862
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:50,061
on who's giving you the
feedback, but it's, it's, it's

863
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:52,954
somewhat

864
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:54,740
non-committal in that sense, in
a sense, you know, like you

865
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,522
don't

866
00:41:56,554 --> 00:42:00,333
have to give you contribution.
You absolutely don't have to,

867
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:04,384
it's not life or death. You know
what I mean? So a lot of the

868
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:09,423
times. Like, you can give your,
you can give a contribution and

869
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:13,893
they give you feedback. And that
feedback is just gold. You know

870
00:42:13,893 --> 00:42:16,833
what I mean? It's just like,
there's stuff that they talk

871
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:20,914
about that they, that you didn't
know, or even necessarily they

872
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:24,934
give you feedback and you push
back on the feedback and say,

873
00:42:24,934 --> 00:42:28,173
Hey, this is my, this is the
reason why, like all of that,

874
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:31,998
that interaction. Is extremely
important. That's what you're

875
00:42:31,998 --> 00:42:37,608
gonna be doing on the job. You
know, like code review is going

876
00:42:37,608 --> 00:42:41,298
to happen. like, well, I don't
wanna say it's going to happen.

877
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:44,748
There are some companies that
anyways, but like the likelihood

878
00:42:44,748 --> 00:42:47,373
of that is so high, like. That
is just an interaction that you

879
00:42:47,373 --> 00:42:49,998
have

880
00:42:49,998 --> 00:42:54,619
to go through, you know, and not
only that, like the amount of

881
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:56,554
information that you can get
from somebody saying, you know,

882
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:58,489
I

883
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:01,219
don't think this is the best way
of doing it. I think this is a

884
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:08,179
better way is this is like,
especially when. It's it can

885
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:12,498
potentially be difficult or just
hard to, to, to, to get

886
00:43:12,498 --> 00:43:15,559
information and to be able to
leverage it immediately. Like,

887
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:18,978
you know, you can go to a
tutorial and you can learn a

888
00:43:18,978 --> 00:43:20,718
bunch of things, but a lot of
the times, if it doesn't apply

889
00:43:20,718 --> 00:43:22,458
to

890
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:24,318
whatever you're doing right now,
you know, it doesn't stick

891
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:26,178
unless

892
00:43:26,184 --> 00:43:31,128
you keep doing it over and over.
But like getting that feedback.

893
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:34,804
You know, on something that
you're working on and then

894
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:36,859
leveraging it and then, you
know, like saying, okay, I've

895
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:38,914
applied

896
00:43:38,914 --> 00:43:41,853
it or I don't, I don't
necessarily agree with your

897
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:45,903
feedback. Like that is such an
important thing. Even if you

898
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:48,634
don't agree with it, it might be
something, whereas, you know,

899
00:43:48,634 --> 00:43:51,123
might be another tool in your
toolbox. You know what I mean?

900
00:43:51,123 --> 00:43:54,250
So, It's it's kind, it's still
kind of sticky because again,

901
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,377
you

902
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,958
know, some people are a little
bit more harsh with their

903
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:03,259
feedback or it's not even
necessarily harsh, but their

904
00:44:03,259 --> 00:44:08,539
feedback doesn't kind of mesh
with how your culturally kind of

905
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:11,343
built to accept feedback, you
know, but like for the most

906
00:44:11,343 --> 00:44:13,877
part,

907
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:16,009
All of that stuff can
potentially be gold to you,

908
00:44:16,009 --> 00:44:17,509
especially as a,

909
00:44:17,778 --> 00:44:21,528
as a new person, still learning,
you know, if like them telling

910
00:44:21,528 --> 00:44:24,168
you, Hey, I don't think this is
necessarily the best way, you

911
00:44:24,168 --> 00:44:26,426
know? All of that is great
stuff. You know, that stuff that

912
00:44:26,426 --> 00:44:28,684
you

913
00:44:28,684 --> 00:44:32,943
can, you can put, you can put
away and then like potentially

914
00:44:32,943 --> 00:44:36,273
work on later. Like even if say
your contribution doesn't get

915
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,163
accepted for whatever reason,
you know, like that information

916
00:44:38,163 --> 00:44:40,053
for

917
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:42,258
you is really, really good when
you're learning, you know? And

918
00:44:42,258 --> 00:44:44,462
it

919
00:44:44,463 --> 00:44:48,454
really just kind like, I would
say in terms of navigating code

920
00:44:48,514 --> 00:44:52,773
code, uh, I don't wanna say well
getting feedback. It really just

921
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:56,789
kinda understanding. The person
and how they're giving feedback.

922
00:44:57,148 --> 00:44:59,233
And if they're giving like
feedback that is not

923
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:01,318
particularly

924
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:03,133
great or is demeaning, you know,
let's get up and walk away

925
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,948
again,

926
00:45:05,128 --> 00:45:08,668
you're not committed, you know,
like if they're going to be that

927
00:45:08,668 --> 00:45:11,699
person, you know, that's not
somebody you want to be

928
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:16,534
associated with. In any form of
kind of long term anything, you

929
00:45:16,534 --> 00:45:19,864
know, but generally like, you
know, people are very friendly.

930
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:22,474
Like people want you to come
back. Like some people

931
00:45:22,474 --> 00:45:25,023
desperately want you to come
back. You know, it's like, you

932
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:28,503
know, I'm working on this by
myself or I'm working on this

933
00:45:28,503 --> 00:45:30,138
with a small group of people,
you know, more people who are

934
00:45:30,138 --> 00:45:31,773
working

935
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:34,773
with me, you know, the better,
you know what I mean? So it's in

936
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:41,298
their it's, they're incentivized
to. To, to kind of keep you

937
00:45:41,298 --> 00:45:45,289
coming back, you know what I
mean? That's and there's also

938
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:48,708
like, this is a part of, kind of
the community aspect of, of open

939
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:52,759
source or a particular open
source project, like how to kind

940
00:45:52,759 --> 00:46:00,168
of contribute and like having a,
having a system kind of around

941
00:46:00,168 --> 00:46:02,530
contribution in the sense of,
you know, code style, you know,

942
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:04,892
Tools

943
00:46:04,893 --> 00:46:08,134
that you, you, you are using and
stuff like that, being very

944
00:46:08,134 --> 00:46:10,608
structured in that way, it
really kind of lets people know

945
00:46:10,608 --> 00:46:13,082
how to,

946
00:46:13,594 --> 00:46:17,583
how to approach the project. You
know what I mean? So that's also

947
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:21,634
a good thing to kind of look
for. It doesn't necessarily, it

948
00:46:21,634 --> 00:46:24,813
doesn't necessarily address
feedback directly, you know, but

949
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:26,614
it kind of addressed what, what
your expectations of the

950
00:46:26,614 --> 00:46:28,114
feedback

951
00:46:28,114 --> 00:46:32,704
will, will, will be, you know,
but yeah. I

952
00:46:32,898 --> 00:46:34,773
Dan: So as a, as a contributor,
like a potential contributor to

953
00:46:34,773 --> 00:46:36,648
a

954
00:46:36,648 --> 00:46:39,108
project, what, what are your
steps? Like, what do you do

955
00:46:39,108 --> 00:46:41,553
before, uh, before you like file
a poll request? Like, what do

956
00:46:41,553 --> 00:46:43,998
you

957
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:45,393
like, I assume you maybe read
the readme. What, what, what

958
00:46:45,393 --> 00:46:46,727
other

959
00:46:46,728 --> 00:46:48,756
kinda steps do you take? Like to
make sure that you're. Doing

960
00:46:48,756 --> 00:46:50,784
what

961
00:46:50,784 --> 00:46:52,563
the maintainers want you to do,
uh, you know,

962
00:46:53,253 --> 00:46:55,218
Chad: To be fair. So I've mostly
been working with open source

963
00:46:55,218 --> 00:46:57,183
and

964
00:46:57,184 --> 00:46:59,208
they've had, they have a very
good, you know, kind

965
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:01,232
contributors

966
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:06,603
doc, you know? And so they kind
of put the systems in place so

967
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:08,403
that you don't necessarily, so
that you don't mess up, you

968
00:47:08,403 --> 00:47:10,203
know,

969
00:47:10,264 --> 00:47:13,293
in a sense, right. So there's
like a lot of kind of guardrails

970
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:15,588
and handholding that the, that
the system will do, you know,

971
00:47:15,588 --> 00:47:17,883
but

972
00:47:18,244 --> 00:47:22,083
like, Again, you know, you can
say for instance, there isn't

973
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:25,053
really any Contra, uh, any. Docs
on contributing generally.

974
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:28,023
That's

975
00:47:28,023 --> 00:47:31,173
the first place you start, you
know, docs on contribute just

976
00:47:31,173 --> 00:47:35,313
the, the, the kind docs on the
infrastructure, right? Like on

977
00:47:35,494 --> 00:47:39,333
how you contribute. Just start
there, you know, before, before

978
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:40,970
anything else, because, uh, a
good, well maintained open

979
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:42,602
source

980
00:47:42,603 --> 00:47:46,668
project will at least have docs
docs to, to tell you. How to

981
00:47:46,673 --> 00:47:49,699
contribute if they don't
necessarily have docs, you may,

982
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:51,544
you know, may reach out to the
maintainer and ask questions.

983
00:47:51,544 --> 00:47:53,119
You

984
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,599
may file an issue, ask questions
by the way, if they don't have

985
00:47:56,869 --> 00:48:01,699
docs on contributing, that's a
really good contribution. you

986
00:48:01,704 --> 00:48:04,341
know, like, but. It's just
really just getting

987
00:48:04,341 --> 00:48:06,978
clarification, how

988
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:09,378
however you can, like, that
doesn't necessarily mean you

989
00:48:09,378 --> 00:48:12,978
don't, you can't just work on
the, on the poll request

990
00:48:12,983 --> 00:48:14,916
immediately, but you know, like
just getting clarification on

991
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:16,849
how

992
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:21,349
they kind of want the, the poll
request set up, like, and like I

993
00:48:21,353 --> 00:48:24,318
said, get that clarification.
However you can either they have

994
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:29,043
dots written or. Reach out to
people directly, you know, you

995
00:48:29,043 --> 00:48:32,523
may even kind of go back to, to,
to previous pull requests and,

996
00:48:32,793 --> 00:48:36,543
and take a look at that. But I
would definitely say if they

997
00:48:36,543 --> 00:48:40,023
don't have docs, just reach out
to the maintainer and, and start

998
00:48:40,023 --> 00:48:44,043
there. Um, I don't have the most
amount of experience here

999
00:48:44,043 --> 00:48:47,704
because. You know, like my open
source, the project that I work

1000
00:48:47,704 --> 00:48:50,059
with, mostly have a lot of these
kind of things in place, but,

1001
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:52,414
you

1002
00:48:52,414 --> 00:48:54,393
know, just getting that
clarification, like that's,

1003
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:56,074
that's the best way I would
submit them. Just get that

1004
00:48:56,074 --> 00:48:58,443
clarification first, because it
would kind, it would kind of

1005
00:48:58,443 --> 00:49:00,812
suck

1006
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:02,118
where you do all of this work.
It may even take you like a

1007
00:49:02,118 --> 00:49:03,423
couple

1008
00:49:03,423 --> 00:49:06,123
of days, you do all of this work
and then you make a poll request

1009
00:49:06,423 --> 00:49:10,324
and then they, they, they, they
deny the poll request for

1010
00:49:10,324 --> 00:49:13,474
something simple that you could
have easily sorted out day one,

1011
00:49:13,923 --> 00:49:17,628
you know? And, you know, nobody
wants their full request,

1012
00:49:17,628 --> 00:49:20,778
rejected, you know what I mean?
So it's like, it it's just like

1013
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:23,059
at the bar least you can just do
those things if you don't, if

1014
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:26,358
you're not necessarily a hundred
percent clear, you know,

1015
00:49:27,693 --> 00:49:32,134
Bekah: I love that. And I mean,
so you've said you contribute to

1016
00:49:32,134 --> 00:49:34,864
opensource and they've got a
great process. So if you wanna

1017
00:49:34,864 --> 00:49:37,384
get started and you wanna know
what a good project looks like,

1018
00:49:37,384 --> 00:49:39,034
so you can identify other ones,
then go to opensource and look

1019
00:49:39,034 --> 00:49:40,684
at

1020
00:49:40,893 --> 00:49:42,566
what they have there, because.
That's a good way to start. And

1021
00:49:42,566 --> 00:49:44,239
I

1022
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:45,919
know, you know, we've got a
pretty thorough, uh,

1023
00:49:45,919 --> 00:49:47,599
contributing

1024
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,438
guidelines doc on our Virtual
Coffee site as well. And you

1025
00:49:51,438 --> 00:49:53,568
know, sometimes there's
discussions, not everybody has

1026
00:49:53,568 --> 00:49:55,353
discussions enabled, but I
really like discussions for

1027
00:49:55,353 --> 00:49:57,138
being able

1028
00:49:57,139 --> 00:50:00,378
to have community members ask
questions about things and to

1029
00:50:00,384 --> 00:50:03,978
learn more. And then also
discussions allows us to see,

1030
00:50:04,188 --> 00:50:07,429
okay, yeah, maybe we're missing
something here or we could add

1031
00:50:07,429 --> 00:50:10,554
this now here's an issue. Hey,
since you brought it up, do you

1032
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:14,693
want to be the one to make the
pool request, um, for that

1033
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:17,183
project? So it is, it is step
one is, well, maybe it's not

1034
00:50:17,183 --> 00:50:19,673
step

1035
00:50:19,673 --> 00:50:23,333
one, but a good step is
identifying what good projects

1036
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:26,693
look like. So you can see them
other places

1037
00:50:27,768 --> 00:50:28,548
Chad: definitely agree.

1038
00:50:29,184 --> 00:50:32,764
Bekah: I kind of wanna pivot a
little bit before we end the

1039
00:50:32,793 --> 00:50:35,974
podcast episode and talk more
about Tech is Hiring because you

1040
00:50:35,974 --> 00:50:38,583
know, all the things that we've
talked about along with open

1041
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:42,184
source, I think contribute to
this idea of Tech is Hiring the

1042
00:50:42,184 --> 00:50:44,853
idea of community, of
connection, of navigating

1043
00:50:44,853 --> 00:50:47,522
through a problem

1044
00:50:47,528 --> 00:50:50,180
that you identified. So what
kind of started your inspiration

1045
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,832
for

1046
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:53,704
Tech is Hiring.

1047
00:50:54,893 --> 00:51:00,114
Chad: Well, it started really
with my own job search. Um, I, I

1048
00:51:00,114 --> 00:51:01,659
don't even know how I came
across this, but I realized

1049
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:03,204
that, you

1050
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:04,526
know, you could just make a
tweet and say, Hey, I'm looking

1051
00:51:04,526 --> 00:51:05,844
for a

1052
00:51:05,844 --> 00:51:09,204
role. And people retweeted, like
people are very, at the very

1053
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:12,963
least in, in the tech industry,
uh, or on tech, Twitter, people

1054
00:51:13,074 --> 00:51:19,518
are very open about you. Helping
people find new roles. And so,

1055
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:21,244
you know, I was doing that a few
times, like in my own job

1056
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,849
search.

1057
00:51:23,148 --> 00:51:26,268
And then I think one day I was
retweeting and I was just

1058
00:51:26,268 --> 00:51:30,498
realized, you know, if you don't
have a good network and yeah, if

1059
00:51:30,498 --> 00:51:33,798
you don't have a good network,
you know, L likelihood of you,

1060
00:51:33,878 --> 00:51:36,605
you, um, The likelihood of your
tweet going viral in a sense,

1061
00:51:36,605 --> 00:51:39,332
it,

1062
00:51:39,393 --> 00:51:43,833
that would help you is, is, is
pretty low. And so, you know, my

1063
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:46,384
first thought was like, Hey, do
we have like a hashtag or

1064
00:51:46,384 --> 00:51:52,143
something that we can, you know,
that we can, um, like post our

1065
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:53,553
tweet to. So at the very least,
you know, it's in one

1066
00:51:53,553 --> 00:51:54,963
centralized

1067
00:51:54,963 --> 00:51:58,759
place and people are like, no,
and I was just. Okay. And

1068
00:51:58,759 --> 00:51:59,973
somebody had reached out and
they were little like, oh, so

1069
00:51:59,973 --> 00:52:01,187
you're

1070
00:52:01,188 --> 00:52:03,619
gonna make a hashtag. Right. And
I was like, I guess I am now. So

1071
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:09,498
ended up like taking a yeah.
Ended up taking like a couple of

1072
00:52:09,498 --> 00:52:11,328
days, just kind of trying to
come up with a name. And then,

1073
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,158
you

1074
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:16,458
know, I just made a quick post
and I was just like, Hey, this

1075
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:20,239
hashtag, you know, post to it.
If you, if you wanted to, if you

1076
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:23,006
want to, to, to, to share your
tweet and. Like I pretty much

1077
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:25,773
did

1078
00:52:25,773 --> 00:52:28,173
that. And initially when I, when
I made the first tweet, I

1079
00:52:28,173 --> 00:52:30,573
didn't,

1080
00:52:30,574 --> 00:52:32,883
I obviously didn't expect
anybody to like be jumping, you

1081
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:35,192
know, out

1082
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:38,344
to the woodwork to kind of tweet
to it. So I just went out my way

1083
00:52:38,349 --> 00:52:40,498
to go find tweets. You know, so
for people to share, to just

1084
00:52:40,498 --> 00:52:42,647
kind

1085
00:52:42,653 --> 00:52:46,998
of encourage and to build that
kind of backlog right. Of places

1086
00:52:47,028 --> 00:52:51,199
of, of, of resources and, you
know, it just kind of grew from

1087
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:56,719
there. So like, uh, I started
adding tweets every day, you

1088
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:58,413
know, every weekday I should
say, I started adding tweets

1089
00:52:58,413 --> 00:53:00,107
every

1090
00:53:00,108 --> 00:53:01,488
day, you know, just took, took a
couple of minutes onto my day.

1091
00:53:01,488 --> 00:53:02,868
In

1092
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:05,088
fact, I'm probably gonna do that
right after I get off of this,

1093
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:10,338
but, uh, took a couple of
minutes. Went through all, you

1094
00:53:10,338 --> 00:53:14,659
know, went and looked for, for
people looking for jobs or had

1095
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:17,358
jobs to share. And I would just
ask them if I could add it to

1096
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:19,548
Tech is Hiring and I've just
been doing that. And, you know,

1097
00:53:19,548 --> 00:53:21,738
at the

1098
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:24,108
end of last year, I started
doing spaces around, around Tech

1099
00:53:24,108 --> 00:53:26,477
is

1100
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:29,958
Hiring. When, when spaces, you
know, became a feature that was

1101
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:35,298
open to the public, I started
doing that. Um, and. There's a,

1102
00:53:35,304 --> 00:53:38,728
there's definitely a lot of
people who just kind of like,

1103
00:53:39,028 --> 00:53:42,239
there's a lot of, kind of, I
don't wanna say there's a lot of

1104
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:46,079
information that people tend to
lack, you know, like even,

1105
00:53:46,168 --> 00:53:49,409
especially there's a lot of job
changes, right? So they may have

1106
00:53:49,414 --> 00:53:54,418
existed in an industry for
periods of time, maybe years,

1107
00:53:54,418 --> 00:53:57,719
decades. Right. And they're
transitioning into the tech

1108
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:02,338
industry and like a simple thing
as how to structure your resume.

1109
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:04,504
Is is something that they may
not necessarily know. You know

1110
00:54:04,504 --> 00:54:06,289
what I

1111
00:54:06,295 --> 00:54:09,918
mean? And it's actually fairly
difficult. It's not as difficult

1112
00:54:09,918 --> 00:54:11,598
now because there's
significantly more resources,

1113
00:54:11,598 --> 00:54:13,278
but it's fairly

1114
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:15,276
different, difficult to find out
how to structure your resume in

1115
00:54:15,276 --> 00:54:17,268
a

1116
00:54:17,268 --> 00:54:19,503
good way. And so, you know, I
was just like, you know, that's

1117
00:54:19,503 --> 00:54:21,738
also

1118
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:24,251
resources that people could
have, you know, People have, you

1119
00:54:24,251 --> 00:54:26,763
know,

1120
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:30,213
hiring or just kind of job
search or just those kind of

1121
00:54:30,213 --> 00:54:35,583
conversations on, on spaces. And
I'll share that, you know, when,

1122
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:38,103
whenever I can, it's like, Hey
mind if I add this to tech to

1123
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:42,244
hiring, you know, and I guess it
just kind of evolved from there.

1124
00:54:42,244 --> 00:54:44,163
I eventually started a
newsletter to kind of do the

1125
00:54:44,163 --> 00:54:46,082
same thing,

1126
00:54:46,414 --> 00:54:50,103
whereas like I have I'll
effectively curate the tweets

1127
00:54:50,103 --> 00:54:53,440
that I see. And then I'll. Take
five of the five people. Who

1128
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,777
were

1129
00:54:56,778 --> 00:54:59,103
looking for jobs and then 10
jobs during that week, and then

1130
00:54:59,103 --> 00:55:01,428
any

1131
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:05,389
additional, like additional
information, like, say for

1132
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:06,768
instance, there was like a
really good thread about, you

1133
00:55:06,768 --> 00:55:08,147
know,

1134
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:13,128
again, let's keep it in context.
Um, talking about resume. You

1135
00:55:13,128 --> 00:55:14,838
know, like I'll, I'll, I'll
share that anything that's a

1136
00:55:14,838 --> 00:55:16,548
part of

1137
00:55:16,548 --> 00:55:18,633
the hashtag I won't like go
searching for stuff, but

1138
00:55:18,633 --> 00:55:20,718
anything

1139
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:22,129
that's a part of the hashtag,
you know, that got retweeted by

1140
00:55:22,129 --> 00:55:23,539
with

1141
00:55:23,543 --> 00:55:27,378
the hashtag I'll, I'll add that
to the newsletter and so on and

1142
00:55:27,378 --> 00:55:32,119
so forth. And, you know, it's
really just kind of been about.

1143
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:37,773
Just trying to be like, uh, make
it, make that, make the whole

1144
00:55:37,773 --> 00:55:41,704
thing about either job searching
or transitioning, just job

1145
00:55:41,704 --> 00:55:44,478
related stuff, make it easier,
you know, especially, um, so

1146
00:55:44,478 --> 00:55:47,252
like

1147
00:55:47,259 --> 00:55:49,919
the, the, the thing about
Twitter is like, When you go on

1148
00:55:49,919 --> 00:55:52,579
LinkedIn

1149
00:55:52,608 --> 00:55:57,289
or when you apply for a job in
any, in any, in any, I guess,

1150
00:55:57,318 --> 00:56:02,358
standard way, right? You, you
upload your, your, your resume

1151
00:56:02,364 --> 00:56:04,041
and so on and so forth. It's
very likely that you won't

1152
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:05,718
necessarily

1153
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:08,358
get seen by a human for whatever
reason. I'm not even gonna get

1154
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:10,969
into that. But for whatever
reason, you may not necessarily

1155
00:56:10,974 --> 00:56:12,951
get seen by a human, you know,
or I don't wanna say that. Uh,

1156
00:56:12,951 --> 00:56:14,928
for

1157
00:56:14,929 --> 00:56:17,719
whatever reason, you won't
interact with a human, I should.

1158
00:56:18,123 --> 00:56:21,333
You know, you may get some
automated email saying you were

1159
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:26,884
rejected or you may not even get
to reply at all. Right. But you

1160
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:30,994
know, for Tech is Hiring because
most of the times I'm retweeting

1161
00:56:30,994 --> 00:56:32,839
tweets that somebody else made,
you know, a lot of the times

1162
00:56:32,839 --> 00:56:34,684
that

1163
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:37,925
person, and a lot of the times
it's a person. This is a

1164
00:56:38,014 --> 00:56:42,244
legitimate person. That person
is no kind of your, your

1165
00:56:42,244 --> 00:56:44,403
interaction, your point of
contact. For that company. So

1166
00:56:44,403 --> 00:56:46,562
say

1167
00:56:46,563 --> 00:56:49,563
for instance, let's, let's go
with AWS. A lot of people

1168
00:56:49,563 --> 00:56:52,204
actually, when they, when
they're, when they're sharing

1169
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:53,809
jobs, they'll say, Hey, you
know, like it's in particular

1170
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:55,414
cases,

1171
00:56:55,414 --> 00:56:57,783
they'll say I'll, I'll
definitely not, what's not

1172
00:56:57,783 --> 00:57:00,152
sponsors the

1173
00:57:00,273 --> 00:57:04,369
what's the phrase. When they,
they recommend you, they they'll

1174
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:10,219
recommend you, you know? And so
you have that, excuse me, you

1175
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:15,648
have that, um, point of contact
with the organization, you know,

1176
00:57:15,648 --> 00:57:20,418
and like, for, for, for getting
hired, like having somebody

1177
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:24,164
recommend you, you know,
especially. A big person

1178
00:57:24,193 --> 00:57:28,603
recommending you is a huge deal.
You know, and for like,

1179
00:57:28,603 --> 00:57:30,448
especially for, for younger
engineers, they don't

1180
00:57:30,448 --> 00:57:32,293
necessarily

1181
00:57:32,293 --> 00:57:35,173
have that network to have
somebody recommend them for a

1182
00:57:35,173 --> 00:57:37,423
job. You know what I mean? And
so, you know, when somebody

1183
00:57:37,423 --> 00:57:39,673
posts

1184
00:57:39,673 --> 00:57:43,873
that, you know, their job is
looking for a opposition and

1185
00:57:44,304 --> 00:57:47,384
somebody sees that they can go
and just reach out to them, they

1186
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:53,028
can send them a DM or they can
send them a reply. And. That,

1187
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:55,233
that interaction is
significantly better. That even

1188
00:57:55,233 --> 00:57:57,108
if you're qual,

1189
00:57:57,168 --> 00:57:59,418
I mean, to be fair, if you're
qualified for the job, you're

1190
00:57:59,418 --> 00:58:02,869
qualified for the job, but just
having that kind of point of

1191
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:04,339
contact, you know, maybe it's
not the job for you, but you

1192
00:58:04,339 --> 00:58:05,809
don't

1193
00:58:05,809 --> 00:58:07,489
know that, you know, you're not
gonna know that until you

1194
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:10,728
interview, so you can sit down
and talk with them. You know,

1195
00:58:10,733 --> 00:58:15,259
like just having that point of
contact is so important. You

1196
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:19,338
know, so like that's kind of,
the real value of Tech is Hiring

1197
00:58:19,338 --> 00:58:22,909
currently is, is not even
necessarily the resources that

1198
00:58:22,914 --> 00:58:27,858
get shared is the resources and
the people who actually share

1199
00:58:27,864 --> 00:58:29,496
them and your ability to
interact with them. You know,

1200
00:58:29,496 --> 00:58:31,128
that's

1201
00:58:31,128 --> 00:58:34,398
really the, the, the main thing
about Tech is Hiring.
