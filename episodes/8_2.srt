00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,639

what they've learned here with

7
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:26,312
me today is my co-host, Dan.

8
00:00:27,753 --> 00:00:28,533
Dan: What up Bek?

9
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:29,672
Bekah: what's up?

10
00:00:30,557 --> 00:00:38,027
Dan: Yo.Um, not much.
Um, today we have another great

11
00:00:33,107 --> 00:00:41,177
as usual episode for y'all.
Um, we have Alex Curtis-Slep,

12
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:45,584
uh, here with us.
Alex is a self-taught software

13
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:47,683
developer, and a long time,
you know, Virtual Coffee

14
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:49,033
member, Virtual Coffee
volunteer, and uh, really.

15
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:52,539
All around great person.
He's one of our, you

16
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:53,798
know, I think most
common, uh, room leaders.

17
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:58,418
He does an amazing job at that.
And, um, is, uh, you

18
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:00,819
know, I don't know.
He's a great, he's a great,

19
00:00:58,418 --> 00:01:03,848
uh, member of our community,
so, uh, we're very happy to

20
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:03,848
have him on the podcast today.

21
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:06,224
Bekah: Yeah.
And one of the things that

22
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:10,453
I really like from this
episode is Alex talking a

23
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:13,513
lot about balancing learning
as a developer, but also

24
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:16,573
there's other hobbies and
passions that you bring

25
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,103
as a human person, right?
Like we're not just developers.

26
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:20,954
We have these other things
that we do, and I think that.

27
00:01:21,778 --> 00:01:24,478
It's really important to
acknowledge all of the different

28
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,009
pieces of us, and I appreciate
Alex, uh, tolerating maybe,

29
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:34,468
uh, encouraging our questions
to, um, dive into some of

30
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:37,649
those other parts of us that
become really important to

31
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:41,679
understand who we are as people
and by extension developers.

32
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:47,504
Dan: Yeah, I totally agree.
I, I mean, I, I think he had

33
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:49,694
a, a really awesome outlook
on, on all that stuff.

34
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:52,394
How to, how to stay healthy
and, you know, in general

35
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:56,444
happy as as a developer.
And, um, he had a lot of

36
00:01:53,924 --> 00:01:58,125
good ideas to sort of help
you do that, uh, in a.

37
00:01:58,676 --> 00:02:04,256
manageable way, right?
As, uh, we still have to

38
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:06,926
work, you know, uh, sometimes
even, even sometimes when

39
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:09,265
we're not feeling great.
And there's, there's a lot

40
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,895
of, there's a lot of ways to
help you get through that.

41
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:12,656
And I think Alex had some, some
great ideas for that process.

42
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:18,086
Bekah: Absolutely.
We start every episode of the

43
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:22,135
podcast, like we start every
Virtual Coffee with introducing

44
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:25,015
ourselves with our name, where
we're from, what we do in

45
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:27,086
a random check-in question.
We hope you enjoy this episode.

46
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:39,474
today's question is, would
you rather go on road trips

47
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:44,965
or fly to a different country?
My name is Bekah.

48
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:56,814
I am a person in tech from
a small town in Ohio, and I

49
00:02:56,814 --> 00:03:02,185
think that it has to do with
who you're taking a trip with.

50
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:08,860
I think road trips can be really
fun, but if it's like road trip

51
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,949
with my kids where we're driving
in a car for a long amount

52
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:16,000
of time, they are not going
to be happy and then that's

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,729
not going to be super fun.
So maybe I would fly with them

54
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,199
to a different country, but I
would not road trip with them.

55
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:29,080
Although I think road
tripping would be very fun.

56
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:41,159
Dan: Nice.Uh.Hi, I'm Dan.
I am also a person in tech

57
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:43,590
and I live in Cleveland.
And, uh, yeah, I love road trips.

58
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,379
I mean, I, I don't mind flying
places or whatever, but, um, I'm

59
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,789
a big, big fan of road tripping
and I would, I have road

60
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:53,879
tripped in two other countries,
you know, well, I guess one,

61
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,310
but, you know, I've done it.
I'm gonna do it again.

62
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,060
Uh, it's good times.
Um, it would be cool to.

63
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,770
Go to Europe and drive around.
I suppose they have like all the

64
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:05,099
trains and stuff like that too.
But you

65
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:06,270
Bekah: I feel like
you're cheating.

66
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,909
You're like, I'm going to
fly to a different country

67
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:11,219
and road trip there.
That's not the question

68
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:19,230
Dan: gosh, uh, can you drive to,
can you drive to South America?

69
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,060
Like from North America?
Is there a bridge over

70
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,060
like the canal and stuff?

71
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:26,415
Alex: I dunno one.

72
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,535
Bekah: feel like you're
pushing it there.

73
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,920
Dan: I've driven to of
times and I'm gonna do

74
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,189
it again this summer.
So, yeah, I, I'm with road trips.

75
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:37,410
Road trips are fun.I like them.
That's my answer.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,480
Alex: Cool.

77
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:40,495
Bekah: Welcome, Alex.Go ahead.

78
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,209
Alex: Thanks for having me.
I'm Alex.

79
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:47,987
I'm a software developer  in
the Tampa Bay, Florida area and.

80
00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:51,242
My choice would be to
fly to my destination.

81
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:54,781
As much as I also love
road trips, I think flying

82
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:56,221
is, is my number one.

83
00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:59,317
Bekah: Nice.Sounds good.

84
00:05:00,322 --> 00:05:01,971
Dan: I'm not a big
fan of airports or

85
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:06,291
like being in planes.
I mean, like, I I like being

86
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:09,141
in the air, but it's just
like the, these planes with

87
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:10,341
all the, you know, you're all
packed in together and stuff.

88
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:11,591
Alex: Yeah,

89
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,101
Dan: I think that's
my main thing.

90
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,851
Bekah: I took my girls to
Houston last week, Texas.

91
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:19,851
And so we had to fly and it
was their first time on a plane

92
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:23,872
and I some of it, but it was so
funny, like they were so loud

93
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:26,122
because they were so excited.
They're like, did you feel that?

94
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:32,422
What?Look at that.
And I was just like, the,

95
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:34,012
joy that they had flying for
the first time was so fun.

96
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:36,853
Alex: Yeah, that's cool.

97
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:41,478
Bekah: So welcome Alex.
We are very, very

98
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:45,588
happy to have you here.
Alex is a longtime member and

99
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:49,278
volunteer at Virtual Coffee,
and we wanna get started

100
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:53,598
with your origin story.
So before we jump into that,

101
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:55,249
what is one word that describes
your developer journey?

102
00:05:56,894 --> 00:05:59,774
Alex: Well, I think at this
point, I'll say gratifying.

103
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:03,283
I think that so many people
have welcomed me with open

104
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:06,884
arms and given me great
support and allowed me to be.

105
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:10,934
Who I am and really just try to
cater to what I'm trying to do.

106
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:14,684
And I just think that that's
been so moving for me on

107
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:18,853
a lot of different levels.
And so I would just say

108
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:18,853
gratifying ultimately.

109
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,629
Bekah: I love that.
That's really great.

110
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:22,579
So talk to us a little bit
about what that journey

111
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:23,298
looked like for you.

112
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:30,745
Alex: Yeah.so.
I'd always been interested in

113
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:36,024
I've had a blog since early
2002, and so my first exposure

114
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:38,785
to coding was customizing
HTML and CSS on, on that site.

115
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:43,345
And I didn't think too much, uh,
about coding at the time as far

116
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:48,324
as, uh, the importance or the
frequency that I would do it.

117
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,834
I was just trying to make my
site look how I wanted it, Later

118
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:56,334
on 2019, um, I was following
Madison Cannon's, uh, YouTube

119
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:59,365
channel and email list, and,
uh, she made a course about.

120
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:04,584
Creating a developer roadmap.
And I thought, okay, you

121
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:08,918
know, I'll give this a shot,
um, just one time fee and

122
00:07:04,764 --> 00:07:11,949
you know, just 50 bucks and
I'll get this a shot and

123
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:14,889
see, see what I think of it.
Um, got nothing to lose

124
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:17,918
and I really liked it.
Um, I took a course from

125
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:22,172
Treehouse on, on front end
development and that was kind

126
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:26,101
of my, my aha so to speak,
about coding and, and this

127
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:30,107
software development stuff,
and went from there and,

128
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:33,166
Did react and open source,
and of course jumped into VC

129
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:37,367
and got to meet more people.
Um, so it just really kind of

130
00:07:33,257 --> 00:07:40,456
brought light to the whole,
uh, the whole scene and,

131
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:44,319
and now I'm meeting more of
these people in person and

132
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:45,613
it's just been an uh, uphill
climb, I guess you could say.

133
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:51,004
And, uh, it's been fun.
So there's a lot of great

134
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:52,624
people here and we're all just
supporting each other and, and.

135
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:57,629
Enjoying enjoying it.
So I think that's ultimately

136
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:57,629
what life's about.

137
00:07:58,793 --> 00:08:02,184
Bekah: Yeah, I love that.
Okay, and I wanna take

138
00:07:59,843 --> 00:08:04,613
a step back for a second
because I think you're

139
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:05,903
the only person I've ever
heard talk about Madison.

140
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:09,444
And can's course.
So, uh, how did you

141
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:14,153
first discover it?
Was it through Twitter and

142
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:14,153
then you started the course?

143
00:08:15,358 --> 00:08:18,048
Alex: Um, so I don't know if
the course is currently still

144
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:24,394
active, but, um, at the time I.
Initially found her YouTube

145
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:27,394
channel just looking different
random stuff on YouTube,

146
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:29,524
and I was on her email list
and then she subsequently.

147
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:33,408
Notified us about the course
and uh, now I think that

148
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:35,928
we're still running the code
book club there on Discord.

149
00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:40,068
And uh, so that's still
a weekly active thing and

150
00:08:40,073 --> 00:08:43,519
uh, I tend to be there.
I've missed the last couple

151
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:45,948
weeks, but I love that group.
And there's a core group of

152
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,749
people that have been around,
uh, since around the same time.

153
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:52,038
VC started in 2020, and
that's a great group of

154
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:56,754
people and we always really.
Like, just like if you do

155
00:08:54,594 --> 00:08:59,724
in vc, we grow together
and we really work on our

156
00:08:56,754 --> 00:08:59,724
skills and it's fantastic.

157
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:02,413
Bekah: That's great.
So what was that course like?

158
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:06,894
Alex: That course,
um, was more about.

159
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,528
Exploring different options.
Okay, you can take courses on

160
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:15,649
this platform or that platform,
and here's the comparison

161
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:17,448
of maybe a self-directed
path to a bootcamp path.

162
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:22,219
And it was more about exploring
the options you have to, to

163
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:25,428
become a developer and, and then
just trying to encourage people

164
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:29,328
to jump into the option that
they felt was best for them.

165
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:31,813
Bekah: I love that.
I think that's really important.

166
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:35,744
And a lot of the challenges
that new folks have coming

167
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:38,024
into tech is figuring out
that exact thing, right?

168
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,423
Especially like there's
so much out there that you

169
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:45,474
could be doing or learning.
And I know at one point

170
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:48,724
I was doing a Udacity
Nanodegree program and it

171
00:09:45,474 --> 00:09:51,244
was like, Soul crushing it
wanted me to die inside and

172
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:52,219
Alex: Oh wow.

173
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:55,714
Bekah: you know, I, I'm, I'm
not cut out for this because

174
00:09:56,283 --> 00:09:59,254
I can't sit here and watch
these videos and finish it.

175
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:02,703
And then I found Flatiron
School and that ended up

176
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:06,183
working way better for me.
And it was a, it

177
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:08,823
was a game changer.
But when you're first exploring

178
00:10:06,183 --> 00:10:11,884
that thing, especially if you
don't have a group of people

179
00:10:08,823 --> 00:10:14,524
there to kind of advise you
or to ask questions to, it

180
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:15,693
can be really hard to figure
out what works for you.

181
00:10:16,854 --> 00:10:20,274
Alex: For sure.
And, um, you know, Madison

182
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:23,124
definitely helped me in a lot
in the beginning, like taking

183
00:10:20,274 --> 00:10:26,020
time to just do one-on-ones
and just see where I was,

184
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:28,900
going and progressing and
having that support and,

185
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,640
and that community, whether
it be virtual or in person.

186
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:35,591
Uh, Like we cultivate here at
VC is, is critical and it really

187
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:39,160
just enables people to level up
and it allows people to, to get

188
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,760
the feedback that they need to,
to change courses they need.

189
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,880
And I think that really
just helps people so much.

190
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,000
And it's something that
really is, uh, a chord of

191
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,071
how I try to live my life.
And it's been inspiring

192
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:55,691
to see how we do that on
a, on an everyday basis.

193
00:10:56,826 --> 00:11:00,485
Bekah: Yeah, I think that's
great AVO advice and I wanna,

194
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:04,235
um, turn to one of you.
Your tweets and we'll link

195
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:06,515
it in the show notes, but it
was from February, I think,

196
00:11:04,235 --> 00:11:09,546
of this year, and it says,
take care of yourself to

197
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:12,426
bring your best each day.
Stay active, well rested,

198
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:14,796
eat fresh foods, hydrate, and
maintain great relationships

199
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:17,676
as much as possible.
You'll write better code and

200
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:20,346
have a lot better day today.
And I just love that

201
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:22,206
so much because I feel
like we often get lost.

202
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:26,155
Um, in all the heaviness of the
stuff that's going on around us

203
00:11:26,155 --> 00:11:29,755
or the stress of learning or the
stress of getting a promotion

204
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:34,105
and all of those things.
And it can be really hard to

205
00:11:30,865 --> 00:11:37,046
stay well-rounded and balanced.
And I think one of the things

206
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:41,875
I've always been most impressed
with you about is that you seem

207
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:45,775
to do a really good job of that.
So, so can you talk a little

208
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:47,005
bit about how you kind
of maintain that balance?

209
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:48,355
Cause it can be really hard.

210
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,755
Alex: Well, thanks,
uh, for, for thinking.

211
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:55,086
I do a great job of it.
It's definitely a volatile thing.

212
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:56,796
There's no, there's
no doubt about it.

213
00:11:57,186 --> 00:12:00,186
I actually got to, uh, my
office 10 minutes before this

214
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:07,041
podcast, so, uh, there we go.
Um, but.You know, I think it's

215
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,711
just important to, to
acknowledge our humanity,

216
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:13,520
but then try to do our best.
Um, I think if we're prepared,

217
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:15,051
then we're just so much,
everything's so much easier.

218
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:19,520
So, um, just, uh, trying to
do your best to know what your

219
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,100
goals are and try to attack them
and have fun doing it and, and,

220
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:29,600
uh, and bring your best to that.
You know, I think sleep

221
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:31,010
is such a underrated,
under talked about thing.

222
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:36,801
It just.
Of course makes us so much

223
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:39,561
better and people cut corners.
And I think we all do

224
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:40,910
that at times and that's,
that's perfectly fine.

225
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,311
But there's certain things
that we really just need

226
00:12:43,316 --> 00:12:48,921
to do on a regular basis.
And, um, your performance is

227
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:50,480
ultimately what should inspire
you and help you remember that.

228
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,480
That's true.I mean, and that's,
that's how it is for me.

229
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,811
Like, cause when I, you know,
go through my day and I'm able

230
00:12:56,816 --> 00:13:00,650
to do all the different things
I try to do and, and then.

231
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,780
Do it pretty well, do it with
a decent amount of smoothness.

232
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,010
It just, it just shows me the,
the importance of why I do what

233
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,211
I do and, uh, how important
I can, the impact I can have.

234
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:15,931
Like, ultimately we do the
things that make us our best

235
00:13:15,931 --> 00:13:21,870
to have an impact, right?
So when my impact is strongest,

236
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:24,331
I feel my best and I feel
like I'm, uh, I'm giving

237
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:28,250
something that really just.
Adds more value to people's

238
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:31,520
lives and, uh, my own.
So ultimately that's what

239
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,870
I wanna to, that's where I
wanna be as much as I can.

240
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,500
And I think when you can
align your goals with that

241
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,221
idea or whatever that is for
you, it can really help you

242
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,640
take care of yourself to,
to bring that and be that.

243
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:48,941
Bekah: I love that and I know
that we have a lot of people

244
00:13:48,946 --> 00:13:51,760
who are looking for jobs,
especially now, um, because

245
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,041
there have been so many
layoffs, so many new folks

246
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:59,155
coming into tech, and so what.
Advice would you give them

247
00:13:56,755 --> 00:14:02,456
when they're kind of on that
part of the journey that

248
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:06,056
feels really frustrating.
They're overwhelmed, they're,

249
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:09,446
you know, putting out tons
of resumes or they're working

250
00:14:06,056 --> 00:14:12,086
really hard and they feel
like they're not making any

251
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:14,275
progress, like they're stuck.
Uh, what would you say to them?

252
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:20,466
Alex: Yeah, I think it's
important to document

253
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:25,056
the small wins, right?
Just let's say you get an

254
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:26,495
open source contribution
merged into a project.

255
00:14:26,495 --> 00:14:29,755
It could be a big one.
It could be a small

256
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:34,461
one, ultimately.
Even though some things are

257
00:14:30,831 --> 00:14:38,660
less, they seem less tangible.
There are wins, there are things

258
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:42,500
that are probably happening.
I remember initially, of course

259
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:45,260
in my tech journey wanting to
get interviews and then, you

260
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,841
know, not getting them and
then finally getting them and

261
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,561
I was thinking, oh yes, great.
I've got interviews.

262
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:54,051
So that's the first step.
So you have to, you have to take

263
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:56,916
it in steps and realize that.
No one just got to

264
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:58,745
the top of the ladder.
They, they climbed up each step.

265
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:01,956
They didn't skip steps to
get to the top of the ladder.

266
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:05,346
I mean, in, in a real
life situation, right?

267
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,166
So maybe, maybe they can
skip steps in tech or, or in

268
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,946
some parts of their lives.
But on a real ladder,

269
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:14,316
no one skips steps.
And ultimately that's where

270
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:16,505
we all are in the, especially
in the beginning of our tech

271
00:15:14,316 --> 00:15:19,895
journey, we're on a ladder.
And so you gotta just, Do

272
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:23,916
what you need to do and stay
positive and, and find that

273
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:25,566
balance, get that rest and, and
do something outside of tech.

274
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:28,326
I think we're always
so focused on tech.

275
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:31,745
We're always so focused on code
and this tool and that tool and

276
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:35,255
all these different things that
are the new hotness, right?

277
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:37,956
So getting a, getting
away from that can help

278
00:15:37,956 --> 00:15:41,451
you get better into that.
As odd as that sounds.

279
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,510
Um, so it's, it's
really important.

280
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:47,091
It's, it's really
how we avoid burnout.

281
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:51,321
It's how we persist.
It's how we bring our best.

282
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,841
I, I know I, we've
talked about that.

283
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:58,791
So it's, uh, just stay positive.
Try to try to get

284
00:15:57,025 --> 00:16:02,211
outside of tech.
Try to do something that gives

285
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:06,350
you that smile, gives you joy.
And then go back to tech with

286
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:11,301
that feeling, with that, um,
greater sense of appreciation

287
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,301
and then see how you go.

288
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,969
Bekah: I was laid off,
as you know, about five

289
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:20,879
weeks ago, and the.
I, I've been trying to

290
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:24,119
rediscover all of those things
that you're talking about, Alex,

291
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:28,048
because I think at some point
I just kind of started letting

292
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:33,538
the weight of things crush me
and I like physically, I feel so

293
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:35,099
much better now and I'm trying
to also build in good habits.

294
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:37,859
We've mentioned Arthur Doer's
talk a couple of times on

295
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:42,839
the podcast about burnout.
Uh, and he was a guest a

296
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:43,769
couple of weeks ago, or this
will be a different season.

297
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:51,239
Uh, he was a guest last season.
Um, But one of the tips that

298
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:54,538
he either said in the talk
or we had in a conversation

299
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:57,568
after the talk was, um, to
avoid burnout, you have to

300
00:16:54,538 --> 00:16:59,399
prepare good habits before
going into the next thing.

301
00:16:59,788 --> 00:17:03,688
And so before I move on
to the next role that I'm

302
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:07,019
taking, I'm trying to like
reinforce those good habits.

303
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:09,959
What are the good things that
I could be doing every day?

304
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,578
And building on that.
So then when I do get into

305
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,199
another role, I don't,
I don't let myself fall.

306
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:19,269
Slide back into these things
that were just really stressing

307
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:22,179
me out and like literally
felt heavy on my shoulders.

308
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:24,638
And so, you know, part
of that is, you know,

309
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:27,999
finding those hobbies.
Somebody asked me, oh, is

310
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:29,108
my son Like, well, what are
your, what are your hobbies?

311
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:29,888
What do you do?
I'm like, I don't know.

312
00:17:29,888 --> 00:17:32,378
I got four kids.
Like, you are my hobby.

313
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:36,278
But even like taking a
10 minute walk outside

314
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:39,919
every morning, that's been
something that I found to be.

315
00:17:40,114 --> 00:17:45,124
Really impactful.
And during my day, and it's,

316
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:47,104
it's 10 minutes, you know,
it's not a huge bit of time.

317
00:17:47,554 --> 00:17:49,983
And some days, some
days it's really cold.

318
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:56,044
It's getting warmer now in Ohio.
But, but um, I think like

319
00:17:51,594 --> 00:18:00,304
that idea of making sure
that you have those things

320
00:17:56,044 --> 00:18:02,374
and building time into
that is really important.

321
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:03,993
And I think that's
also something that

322
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:07,324
you do really well.
And one of the things that

323
00:18:04,743 --> 00:18:09,564
I find refreshing about,
You're like following

324
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:12,894
your Instagram, right?
Like you're posting exotic

325
00:18:09,564 --> 00:18:16,856
fruits and I love to see it,
you know, cuz so much of our

326
00:18:12,894 --> 00:18:19,166
community on social media
and tech is so tech focused.

327
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:23,037
And to be able to see, hey,
there's other cool things

328
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:25,136
out there that we can talk
about and it doesn't have to

329
00:18:25,136 --> 00:18:29,186
be tech all the time actually
like is really refreshing.

330
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:33,586
Alex: Yeah, I really like it
because I love other things.

331
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:37,217
I mean, we all don't just
love tech, at least I think.

332
00:18:37,636 --> 00:18:41,267
And um, you know, it's great
to love tech and we can

333
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:44,237
always dig into tech, but
there's other things to life.

334
00:18:44,237 --> 00:18:46,606
There's, I like fruit,
I like basketball.

335
00:18:46,606 --> 00:18:50,027
I like taking care of myself.
I like my friends and family.

336
00:18:50,027 --> 00:18:51,707
I like traveling.
I like languages.

337
00:18:51,707 --> 00:18:55,757
I mean, everyone has, has their
handful or, or more of things

338
00:18:55,757 --> 00:18:59,537
and, and that's what we need to.
To have fun with.

339
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:01,336
I mean, we're not always
just gonna be working.

340
00:19:01,336 --> 00:19:04,156
We're not always just gonna
be coding, and we should be

341
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:08,446
coding and we should be enjoying
that whole process, but we.

342
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:13,787
Be well-rounded people.
We wanna be more

343
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:16,396
than just developers.
And, uh, I think it's important.

344
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:18,586
One thing you, you mentioned
the 10 minute walk.

345
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:20,596
It doesn't have to be
a big time investment.

346
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:23,656
Five or 10 minutes can,
can really do a lot.

347
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,997
It could be stretching, it
could be meditating, it could

348
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:29,507
be going for that walk or going
for a quick run, quick sprints.

349
00:19:30,076 --> 00:19:32,957
Something that really
resonates with you, that

350
00:19:32,957 --> 00:19:35,416
doesn't necessarily take a
lot of time, can make a big

351
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:37,787
impact on your daily reality.

352
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:40,517
Bekah: I think I have to draw
the line at sprints we can.

353
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:46,642
Sprints are hard.
I did sprints the other day

354
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:54,231
and my lungs hated me for the
rest of the day, so, um, Yeah,

355
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:57,501
I, I think that that idea is
really important and I like

356
00:19:54,231 --> 00:19:58,912
the idea of being able to
celebrate your little wins.

357
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:02,211
And I was talking to somebody
recently who's been searching

358
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:04,791
for a job for a while, and
they were kind of getting, they

359
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:08,372
were really discouraged, right?
But they had an

360
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:10,892
interview and I said, I.
Having an interview

361
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:15,511
is a win, right?
And celebrating each of those

362
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:18,422
tiny things becomes important
because you can't, you're

363
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:21,092
right, like you're not going to
skip to the top of the thing.And

364
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:24,781
when you're going through
that process, the interview

365
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:28,561
process can be really grueling,
especially for your first job.

366
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:29,866
Alex: Mm-hmm.

367
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:33,061
Bekah: celebrate those, it's
going to become really hard to.

368
00:20:34,656 --> 00:20:37,856
Bring your best self to the
interviews that you are doing.

369
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:41,791
Alex: It's very true, and the
interview process I think is.

370
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:45,076
Maybe the most grueling part
of the process, even more

371
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:50,737
than learning all this stuff.
I think, um, just sometimes

372
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:53,567
we make it more personal
than just business, because

373
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:56,237
ultimately it's just business.
And if a company makes a

374
00:20:53,567 --> 00:21:00,257
decision, it's not necessarily
a reflection on you, but of

375
00:20:56,237 --> 00:21:01,517
course you have control over how
you perform in the interviews.

376
00:21:01,757 --> 00:21:04,217
So, uh, that's a thing where
I think you really wanna

377
00:21:04,217 --> 00:21:06,817
be gentle with yourself.
You wanna just understand that.

378
00:21:07,186 --> 00:21:11,146
It's a business decision.
It's not a personal,

379
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:12,676
like you're a bad person.
I'm not gonna hire you decision.

380
00:21:12,676 --> 00:21:15,886
It's just a decision based on
what's best for the business.

381
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:20,626
And I think removing that
personal aspect is will allow

382
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:24,227
you to really just move with
so much more brevity and,

383
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:27,196
and get the result you're
looking for a lot faster.

384
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:32,092
Bekah: Yeah, and I, I've heard
circumstances of, you know,

385
00:21:32,096 --> 00:21:34,701
people putting out hundreds
of job applications and

386
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:37,942
getting really discouraged by
that, but I recently heard.

387
00:21:38,451 --> 00:21:42,862
Listen to an audiobook.
I can't remember who it was

388
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:46,432
by, but they said they look
at resumes for 30 seconds and

389
00:21:42,862 --> 00:21:50,211
then if you're interesting,
they'll Google you and

390
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:52,221
look at your, like, what?
How you show up in the

391
00:21:50,211 --> 00:21:54,561
search results for a minute.
So you have a minute and a half.

392
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:57,442
And so I, I think, I know
that it's really hard when

393
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,692
you're putting out so many
resumes and cover letters to

394
00:21:59,692 --> 00:22:02,751
get down on yourself or to
be constantly tweaking it.

395
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:07,491
But, but the fact is like,
30 seconds is not a whole

396
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:11,031
lot of time to really get to
know and understand someone.

397
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:13,612
And so, you know,
finding those ways to be

398
00:22:14,122 --> 00:22:17,182
positive is important.
So, you know, what are

399
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:19,251
some of the ways that you
were able to do that as

400
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:19,251
you were interviewing?

401
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:25,811
Alex: That's a good question.
I think, I think there was a

402
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:29,382
lot going on in my life when I
was trying to, the, the majority

403
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:33,221
of this journey getting into
tech, you know, COVID was going

404
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:35,172
on and, uh, living at this
apartment that I no longer live.

405
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:40,082
It just, you know, I think it
was, uh, Just trying to fit in

406
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:45,481
the time to, to, to do this.
And, uh, as far as staying

407
00:22:42,122 --> 00:22:46,412
positive with that man, I
think it was up and down.

408
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,451
I think there were times
when I really just felt,

409
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:53,221
what am I doing here?
Am I gonna be able to get

410
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:56,251
this thing I'm looking for?
And there were times when

411
00:22:53,642 --> 00:22:58,592
I would code and do stuff
and I just thought, you

412
00:22:56,251 --> 00:23:02,372
know, this is so cool.
And I'm really just, I'm making

413
00:22:58,592 --> 00:23:04,412
contributions to open source.
I'm, I'm building

414
00:23:02,372 --> 00:23:05,971
this React project.
I've built this Madlibs game.

415
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:09,916
I think it was really, All
over the place, in all honesty.

416
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:13,487
But I think what kept me
positive was just the fact that

417
00:23:13,487 --> 00:23:16,547
I, just thinking back to when
I started thinking back to when

418
00:23:16,547 --> 00:23:20,027
I found the joy for front end
and just development in general,

419
00:23:20,477 --> 00:23:24,227
um, and just also remembering,
like, I remember for some

420
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:26,807
reason when I was really young
and I was reading something,

421
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:29,146
I, I remember I learned about
what APIs are and for some

422
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:33,136
reason that stands out for me.
And that just something is, that

423
00:23:30,886 --> 00:23:34,247
I think is cool and something
that I always remember.

424
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:39,451
And so I just know like.
Where I come from with this

425
00:23:36,571 --> 00:23:40,592
and why I'm here and why
I'm doing what I'm doing.

426
00:23:41,102 --> 00:23:42,902
That ultimately
is what guides me.

427
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:46,172
But, um, I think it
was really up and down.

428
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:48,811
There were times I felt really
great about my resume and

429
00:23:48,817 --> 00:23:53,102
what I was putting out there.
And there were times when

430
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:56,971
I felt like I'm just going
through the motions and this

431
00:23:53,102 --> 00:23:58,832
thing is just spinning around
and not not going anywhere.

432
00:23:58,832 --> 00:24:03,001
And um, so I think just sticking
with it overall, despite how you

433
00:24:03,001 --> 00:24:05,491
feel is, is the way to do it.

434
00:24:08,376 --> 00:24:13,821
Bekah: There's, um, A like
trending audio on Instagram

435
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:16,551
reels, that's on a bunch
of, I think it's like,

436
00:24:16,882 --> 00:24:19,731
well, I've got like the
weightlifting algorithm, right?

437
00:24:19,731 --> 00:24:22,372
So those are the majority
of the videos that,

438
00:24:22,372 --> 00:24:26,932
the reels that I get.
But, um, it, it, it kind of

439
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:30,321
talks about the same thing
like, Nobody else is gonna

440
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:31,551
show up for you if you don't
show up for yourself, right?

441
00:24:31,942 --> 00:24:34,281
And sometimes it's going to
be easy and sometimes you're

442
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:37,231
going to see that progress,
and other times it's gonna

443
00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:39,832
be months and you are not
going to see that progress.

444
00:24:39,832 --> 00:24:43,971
And so it's not about the
gains, it's not, it's about you

445
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:47,511
get up and you have to do it.
And that's really,

446
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:51,142
really hard sometimes.
And that's why I think like

447
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:54,531
forming those good habits and
trying to stay, have a positive

448
00:24:51,142 --> 00:24:58,916
mindset is really important.
And then, In those times where

449
00:24:54,892 --> 00:25:01,106
it feels impossible to do that.
That's why having a good

450
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:04,586
supportive community around
you is so important because

451
00:25:01,106 --> 00:25:06,297
there are times that you feel
like, Hey, I can't do this.

452
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:10,047
I cannot submit one more
resume or do one more rep or

453
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:12,817
whatever, and then someone.
Someone come.

454
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:15,547
There's the, okay, so I'll
tell a weightlifting story

455
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:19,747
about, I don't remember.
One time I was deadlifting

456
00:25:16,537 --> 00:25:21,067
and like couldn't move
it off the ground, right?

457
00:25:21,457 --> 00:25:24,307
And then one of the
guys from the gym came.

458
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:26,047
He's like, come on,
you got this right?

459
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:27,666
And I was like, all
right, I got this.

460
00:25:27,672 --> 00:25:29,017
And then I did it, right?Like

461
00:25:29,507 --> 00:25:30,106
Alex: Yeah.

462
00:25:30,156 --> 00:25:33,186
Bekah: there was, I was the
same amount of strong that

463
00:25:33,426 --> 00:25:40,011
I was three seconds ago.
But having somebody cheer me

464
00:25:35,662 --> 00:25:43,701
on give me that little bit
of confidence that I didn't

465
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:46,402
have in myself was enough
for me to lift that very

466
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:48,922
heavy thing off the ground.
And I feel like that's a

467
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:50,182
really good metaphor for
why community matters.

468
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:53,957
Alex: Yeah, I mean, I think
that our own self-confidence is

469
00:25:53,957 --> 00:25:57,376
our biggest catalyst, and what
that person did was instilled

470
00:25:57,376 --> 00:26:03,406
self-confidence within you.
So, um, falling in love with

471
00:25:59,356 --> 00:26:08,082
the process is, is important.
And I think that's, A big

472
00:26:03,406 --> 00:26:11,741
part of my, uh, my reality.
But, uh, if you are

473
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:14,352
self-confident, then like
you could be not even the

474
00:26:12,102 --> 00:26:17,531
best developer you could
be, not even the best

475
00:26:14,352 --> 00:26:19,392
weightlifter, whatever, but
that confidence and that that.

476
00:26:20,237 --> 00:26:23,267
If you have it, people will
know, and it, you'll exude that

477
00:26:23,267 --> 00:26:26,477
confidence and you'll be able
to be that much better off.

478
00:26:26,477 --> 00:26:30,527
You'll really just stand out and
you'll, uh, you'll be, you'll

479
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:33,136
be that much better because
you're believing in yourself.

480
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:35,567
And that's, that's a big
part of, I think, getting

481
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:38,777
into this, uh, software
development is just remembering

482
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:42,586
that you're worth it.
You're here for a reason,

483
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:45,586
you have a place here.
And, uh, just standing

484
00:26:42,592 --> 00:26:46,727
that ground and, and
making cementing it.

485
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:52,259
Dan: I love that so much.
I was actually like, I wanted

486
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,490
to go back a little bit to some
of the stuff we were talking

487
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:56,130
about when you were talking
about, um, how important

488
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:58,470
sleep is right to your,
your outlook and everything.

489
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,390
And, and I totally agree with
it, but I, I was wondering as

490
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,849
a person who sometimes maybe
struggles with some of that

491
00:27:02,849 --> 00:27:07,200
balance and some of the sleep
stuff, if you have any specific.

492
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,519
I don't know, habits or
whatever, you know, to, to

493
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:13,700
help yourself get the right
amount of sleep and get, you

494
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,460
know, and like figure out
that cycle and get it, you

495
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,930
know, like in good shape.

496
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:21,954
Alex: Yeah, so it certainly
goes up and down for me as well.

497
00:27:21,954 --> 00:27:24,265
Uh, one thing that I think
is helpful is kind of

498
00:27:24,265 --> 00:27:27,805
turning off all your screens,
uh, as early as possible.

499
00:27:28,464 --> 00:27:31,045
Our screens are very
stimulating, lots of different,

500
00:27:31,164 --> 00:27:34,194
uh, blue light and all
that fun stuff, dopamine.

501
00:27:34,832 --> 00:27:37,382
so the sooner we can get away
from that and kind of start

502
00:27:37,382 --> 00:27:42,602
to chill and, uh, you know,
Get into maybe a self-care

503
00:27:42,602 --> 00:27:45,211
routine, like turning off your
screens and then, you know,

504
00:27:45,241 --> 00:27:48,571
cleaning your teeth or, um,
sometimes that's what I'm doing.

505
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:52,412
Or I read my, I read a book, um,
like, you know, certain people,

506
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:55,531
sometimes books wake them up.
Sometimes books

507
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,432
will chill you down.
Depends on the topic.

508
00:27:56,432 --> 00:28:00,182
Depends on the person.
Um, maybe it could be

509
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:03,362
a stretching routine.
I just, one of the big things

510
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:04,711
I would say, like I said, is
turning those screens off.

511
00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:08,942
Um, finding that centered space,
um, getting away from what you

512
00:28:08,946 --> 00:28:11,582
were doing on those screens,
the topics like just kind

513
00:28:11,582 --> 00:28:17,551
of mellowing out in any way.
Uh, that, you know, for

514
00:28:14,102 --> 00:28:18,662
me, I like to clean my
teeth and read a book.

515
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:21,122
Um, I know everyone's
a little different.

516
00:28:21,126 --> 00:28:23,192
It could be a nice little
stretching routine.

517
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:25,981
Um, maybe some kind of
like hot compress on

518
00:28:25,981 --> 00:28:31,862
your eyes with a towel.
Could be a nice way to

519
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:34,112
chill and, uh, mellow out.
But, uh, those are

520
00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:34,112
my preferred ones.

521
00:28:35,136 --> 00:28:39,156
Dan: Nice.
I like the idea of like

522
00:28:36,727 --> 00:28:40,176
doing the hot compress just
at, at night every day.

523
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,207
That's, that sounds really nice.
It sounds pleasant.

524
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:47,386
Alex: Yes.
Um, I don't go for that

525
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:49,517
one at night too often,
but it's a good one.I like that.

526
00:28:50,136 --> 00:28:51,876
Dan: uh, I wanted to
echo what you said about

527
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:55,057
stretching before bed.
Actually, advice my therapist

528
00:28:53,017 --> 00:28:57,906
gave me when I was having
some trouble, like falling

529
00:28:55,057 --> 00:28:59,076
asleep was like just a
simple stretching routine.

530
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:04,926
Um, and.And it helped so much.
And it was, it was so weird cuz

531
00:29:02,436 --> 00:29:07,326
it wasn't like I was laying in
bed like, oh, my muscles are

532
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:07,866
sore, or something like that.
You know what I mean?

533
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,777
It, it wasn't really like
directly related, but it's just

534
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:13,807
like, well, we all know our mind
and our bodies are obviously

535
00:29:13,807 --> 00:29:16,686
very much connected and uh, it
made a big difference for me.

536
00:29:16,747 --> 00:29:18,277
Uh, so I think that's
good advice too.

537
00:29:18,277 --> 00:29:20,557
And that's, that's all
I had to say about that.

538
00:29:22,172 --> 00:29:26,041
Bekah: Yeah, and exploring just
different ways to wind down

539
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:30,152
to get your mind and your body
prepared to go to sleep, I think

540
00:29:30,152 --> 00:29:33,241
can be, can be really hard.
That's a skill, right?

541
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:36,541
It it can be really challenging
to be able to do that.

542
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:39,821
Alex: Well, I think it,
it's a habit and it's

543
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:42,701
built by consistency.
I think consistency.

544
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:45,116
Is discipline, if
that makes sense.

545
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,946
People talk about
discipline, but I think

546
00:29:47,487 --> 00:29:51,567
ultimately consistency
makes discipline so easy.

547
00:29:51,987 --> 00:29:56,126
So just make it a habit and
try to stick with it and it'll,

548
00:29:56,126 --> 00:29:57,537
it'll get easier over time.

549
00:29:58,382 --> 00:30:00,721
Bekah: Yeah, I find that I'm
really good at things like that

550
00:30:00,727 --> 00:30:05,162
until I, uh, fall off track
and then it becomes really

551
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:10,832
hard to get started again.
Like, you know, I'll, I'll

552
00:30:07,021 --> 00:30:13,122
eat super healthy for like six
months straight and then I.

553
00:30:13,122 --> 00:30:17,307
I go visit a friend and
get totally off track, and

554
00:30:17,307 --> 00:30:20,217
then it takes me like two
months to get back on track.

555
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:26,517
Alex: Yep.It's, it's real.
Um, depends on your

556
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:29,126
level of commitment.
I think that's where you

557
00:30:26,517 --> 00:30:32,426
realign with your why.
And then boom, it's,

558
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:34,017
you get back on track.
You, you jump back on the train.

559
00:30:34,047 --> 00:30:37,467
Um, but you really gotta
resonate with your why

560
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:41,636
and, and connect with it.
Reconnect with it as you

561
00:30:38,787 --> 00:30:41,636
need to, to get you back.

562
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:45,092
Bekah: Yeah, I like that idea
of reconnect with your why,

563
00:30:45,092 --> 00:30:47,882
and I think that's part of,
you know, the issues that I

564
00:30:47,882 --> 00:30:53,291
was really facing in the last.
Six months with stress is like

565
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:57,011
not knowing what the why was.
At some point I lost that,

566
00:30:53,291 --> 00:31:01,481
and then it became really hard
to get back on track and then

567
00:30:57,011 --> 00:31:04,241
doing just like a lot of, I
would say, self-destructive

568
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:05,981
things, not just like low
key, right, bad habits.

569
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:09,971
Not sleeping well, not
doing things that I know

570
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:13,932
enrich my life and lead to
good decisions, you know?

571
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:17,771
Um, and then just kind of going
with it because it lost that

572
00:31:17,777 --> 00:31:21,162
idea and didn't know how to,
kind of like, first of all, I

573
00:31:21,162 --> 00:31:25,571
didn't realize that I lost it.
And second of all,

574
00:31:23,021 --> 00:31:30,102
once I did kind of.
See, I wasn't really sure how

575
00:31:25,692 --> 00:31:33,912
to recalibrate after that.
So do you have any thoughts on,

576
00:31:30,102 --> 00:31:38,501
you know, if people are in that
situation, how to kind of like

577
00:31:33,912 --> 00:31:40,991
figure out what that why is?
If they're feeling like, I

578
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:40,991
don't know what it is right now.

579
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:52,872
Alex: That's a good question.
Um, I think just, uh,

580
00:31:45,912 --> 00:31:55,662
consider what drives you.
Consider what makes you

581
00:31:52,902 --> 00:32:01,422
wanna wake up in the morning.
Try to try to see where your

582
00:31:56,291 --> 00:32:07,196
passion, your fire comes from,
and then, Define and align your

583
00:32:01,932 --> 00:32:12,477
goals in parallel with that?
I am, you know, cause I'm gonna

584
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:15,926
get up every day and, and dig in
and love and, uh, go crazy about

585
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:18,596
the things I love all the time.
Like, that's just, I feel

586
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:20,727
like my life in a sense, like
the things I love are the

587
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:24,326
things that drive me and the
things that keep me going

588
00:32:20,727 --> 00:32:27,987
and, uh, keep me engaged.
And so if you fall

589
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:30,416
off, think about.
Why, what do I love?

590
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,967
What do I, what do
I wanna always do?

591
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:39,656
What am I always keen for?Right?
And then just

592
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:42,311
redefine your goals.
To bring your best for that.

593
00:32:43,122 --> 00:32:46,571
You know, like could be, you
know, I love running every day.

594
00:32:46,571 --> 00:32:51,162
I'm gonna, you know, train to do
this 5K, or, you know, anything.

595
00:32:51,162 --> 00:32:55,092
I love writing.
I'm going to write a hundred

596
00:32:51,942 --> 00:32:57,791
words, 300 words that are
really solid and really verbose.

597
00:32:57,797 --> 00:33:01,451
In a, in a, they,they say a lot.
These 300 words are

598
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:07,001
really meaningful.
Um, so developing tangible,

599
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:11,682
small, doable things
that, Uh, you know, go

600
00:33:07,481 --> 00:33:14,951
along with your passion.
Uh, really can, can

601
00:33:11,832 --> 00:33:14,951
get you back over time.

602
00:33:16,616 --> 00:33:19,707
Bekah: I like that.
I found one of the

603
00:33:17,277 --> 00:33:21,386
things too that's been
helpful for me recently.

604
00:33:21,686 --> 00:33:23,997
You know, when you're in tech,
everything moves so quickly.

605
00:33:23,997 --> 00:33:25,737
There's always
something new to learn.

606
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,537
There's always.
Always a different way to grow.

607
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:30,356
There's a new podcast or
there's a new audio book

608
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:32,666
that everybody should read to
help you improve your life.

609
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:35,666
Right.And I felt like probably
at some point I was on

610
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:39,747
information overload, like
constantly learning, and

611
00:33:39,747 --> 00:33:44,906
sometimes it's just too much.
And so now if I take a walk in

612
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:46,136
the morning, or if I run, I'm
usually listening to music.

613
00:33:46,646 --> 00:33:50,606
And before I wouldn't do that.
I'm like, this is a good time

614
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:51,326
for me to learn something new.
I'm like, you know what?

615
00:33:51,717 --> 00:33:54,866
My brain just needs to
chill out for a little bit.

616
00:33:54,866 --> 00:34:00,116
And, and that's okay.
You don't always have to

617
00:33:56,366 --> 00:34:03,777
be doing something to that
seemingly improves your life

618
00:34:00,836 --> 00:34:08,396
because the simple things
sitting down and enjoying life,

619
00:34:04,047 --> 00:34:11,577
you know, listening to my kids
laugh or, you know, walking

620
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:15,061
around the neighborhood without.
Like having a secondary

621
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:20,161
mission for learning or
whatever is important,

622
00:34:15,061 --> 00:34:21,271
maybe just as important
as learning something new.

623
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:26,786
Alex: Oh yeah.
I mean, finding the times to

624
00:34:22,797 --> 00:34:29,097
relax and, uh, bring more levity
and just, uh, have fun laugh.

625
00:34:29,097 --> 00:34:31,737
I think it's, it's just
as important as the work

626
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:35,882
and the consistency.
Um, So definitely

627
00:34:33,056 --> 00:34:39,541
make space for that.
Hopefully you've got family,

628
00:34:35,882 --> 00:34:42,871
friends, uh, around you.
Um, if you don't, then

629
00:34:39,692 --> 00:34:45,481
just try to seek them out.
You know, my sister and

630
00:34:42,931 --> 00:34:48,391
I started doing fruit lux
because, uh, we wanted people

631
00:34:45,481 --> 00:34:51,452
that were interested in fruit
to come together and build

632
00:34:48,396 --> 00:34:52,842
a community of, you know,
vegan and fruit loving people.

633
00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:57,871
And so that's what we did.
And, um, we've, you know, made

634
00:34:54,601 --> 00:35:02,972
tons of friends from that.
So, uh, make it, if it's not

635
00:34:57,871 --> 00:35:03,842
there and just, uh, create
what you're looking for.

636
00:35:04,472 --> 00:35:06,331
Bekah: I love that.
Make it if it's not there.

637
00:35:06,391 --> 00:35:10,141
I think that that is
really, really great advice.

638
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:13,501
And sometimes it can be
scary, sometimes it can be

639
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:17,192
an accident, but like finding
those things that enrich your

640
00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:21,152
life are really important.
And if you see something that

641
00:35:18,811 --> 00:35:22,501
you wanna do, then find a
way to put it into action.

642
00:35:23,726 --> 00:35:24,447
Alex: Exactly.

643
00:35:25,322 --> 00:35:28,382
Bekah: I remember once I was
talking to, this is kind of

644
00:35:28,382 --> 00:35:31,981
circling back a little bit.
I was talking to a mom who was

645
00:35:29,342 --> 00:35:35,161
learning how to code and she
was saying how hard it was for

646
00:35:31,981 --> 00:35:37,411
her to retain the information.
She's like, I'm going over

647
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:40,351
the same stuff all the time.
And so he said, okay, well,

648
00:35:37,922 --> 00:35:41,791
like what is your process?
Walk me through how

649
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:44,641
you're learning.
And it was something like,

650
00:35:42,092 --> 00:35:47,521
well, you know, after my kids
go to bed, I will code from.

651
00:35:47,867 --> 00:35:53,746
10: 00 PM until midnight.
And then I wanna get some

652
00:35:49,876 --> 00:35:56,206
coding in before they wake up.
So I'll get up at four and

653
00:35:53,746 --> 00:35:58,847
then I do it from four to six.
I'm like, you're getting

654
00:35:56,206 --> 00:36:01,652
four hours of sleep.
That's why you're not

655
00:35:59,342 --> 00:36:05,641
retaining anything.
And it, it often feels like

656
00:36:02,132 --> 00:36:06,061
there's this race to get ahead.
Right.

657
00:36:06,422 --> 00:36:09,931
And I even felt coming outta
my bootcamp, I remember

658
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:12,722
very naively thinking like,
oh, once I land a job now

659
00:36:12,722 --> 00:36:16,981
I'll be able to breathe.
Like, no, you are, you are not

660
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:19,112
going to be able to breathe.
It's g it's about

661
00:36:17,132 --> 00:36:22,181
to get even harder.
Um, and so again, back to

662
00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:25,561
that idea of building good
habits, but like, don't

663
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:27,552
undervalue that there's a
process and it takes time.

664
00:36:27,612 --> 00:36:30,791
And for every person it's
going to be a different path

665
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:33,342
and it's going to take a
different amount of time.

666
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:37,661
Crushing your, your body and
your spirit is not going to

667
00:36:37,902 --> 00:36:39,942
help you get there any faster.

668
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:46,282
Alex: Yeah, I mean, I think.
I can echo the same thing

669
00:36:43,552 --> 00:36:49,702
from my own experience.
I mean, just being about four

670
00:36:46,282 --> 00:36:53,181
months into my, my first job
here, I feel like it's taken

671
00:36:49,702 --> 00:36:58,282
me up to this point to get
into the flow and into the,

672
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:59,871
um, ways to really optimize
my schedule and my week.

673
00:37:00,244 --> 00:37:03,260
Um, you know, soon after I
started it was the holidays.

674
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,681
So, um, that took me away for
a couple weeks and, uh, outta.

675
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:10,076
You know, building up the flow
and, uh, understanding how

676
00:37:10,076 --> 00:37:14,456
to be my best and knowing,
you know, how much to take on

677
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:17,846
work-wise outside of work and,
you know, all that good stuff.

678
00:37:17,846 --> 00:37:21,746
And, um, you know, it does
take time and you really wanna

679
00:37:21,746 --> 00:37:24,655
respect that process and you
wanna just know that you're

680
00:37:24,655 --> 00:37:30,025
gonna get to a better place.
You're gonna level out, you're

681
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:33,851
gonna find that balance and,
uh, It does take a good amount

682
00:37:30,025 --> 00:37:35,201
of time, but that's what
good things take is time.

683
00:37:35,201 --> 00:37:39,130
And just remember that cliche
and you'll be much better off.

684
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,920
Bekah: And what does that
adjustment look like for

685
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,001
you, going from not having
this job to starting it

686
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:46,990
to where you are now?

687
00:37:48,596 --> 00:37:52,045
Alex: Um, well, I think a lot
of it was just understanding

688
00:37:52,045 --> 00:37:55,826
how much to do in the evening.
Cause I think that,

689
00:37:53,576 --> 00:37:58,346
like I was doing a lot.
I would jump on the Virtual

690
00:37:55,826 --> 00:38:01,286
Coffee co-working room.
I would really try to go to the

691
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:03,206
meetups and stuff that happened
virtually, uh, a lot and.

692
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,521
Like, that's great and there's
a time and place for that.

693
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:08,951
But when you're working,
you need to kinda give

694
00:38:08,951 --> 00:38:12,911
yourself some time to chill.
Give yourself some time away

695
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:14,291
from the screen and make
sure your, your body's right.

696
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,880
Make sure you're getting
that rest that we,

697
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:19,641
that we talked about.
Um, so I think that

698
00:38:17,351 --> 00:38:22,931
it was really just.
The first couple months still

699
00:38:20,141 --> 00:38:25,661
trying to engage and still
trying to really kind of do

700
00:38:22,931 --> 00:38:29,710
what I used to do, but then
realizing and pivoting and

701
00:38:25,661 --> 00:38:31,181
saying, okay, now I need to take
a little bit off my shoulders.

702
00:38:31,181 --> 00:38:34,090
I need to just do a little
bit less, but uh, still show

703
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,690
up, still have my presence,
be known, and, um, just bring

704
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,050
it more for when I'm working.
And then that's

705
00:38:39,195 --> 00:38:43,510
the most important.
And it also helped me because

706
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:46,121
when I was initially working,
I was a lot in, I was in the

707
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:49,990
office all the time, but now
I'm hybrid, so, I'm in the

708
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:51,460
office today, but I'm only
in the office twice a week.

709
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,161
So I think that really helped
me kind of give myself more

710
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:57,460
time, let myself do other
things to make my, like,

711
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,190
get my workouts in in the
morning and stuff like that.

712
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,920
And, um, so I think it's
just been a progression.

713
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,561
And luckily where I work,
they're really open-minded.

714
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:08,291
They're really, uh,
receptive to, to what I

715
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:11,530
have to say and, and what
I know will help me and.

716
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:15,311
So we're just working on it
together and it's getting better

717
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:19,110
over time, which is fantastic.
It's been, it's

718
00:39:17,536 --> 00:39:19,110
been a fun process.

719
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,050
Bekah: Yeah.
That's really great to hear.

720
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,731
I, I know that, um, one
of the things that I've.

721
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:31,411
Done to kind of help with that
balance too, is when, when

722
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:34,170
you are working remotely, you
are in front of a screen all

723
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:38,581
the time and then meetings are
in front of a screen, right?

724
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,860
You're talking.
So it's just never ending.

725
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,340
So I do have the under the
desk treadmill, but I started

726
00:39:44,346 --> 00:39:49,860
taking, um, meetings with my
camera off and going for a walk.

727
00:39:49,981 --> 00:39:53,521
So I'll just use my
cell phone network.

728
00:39:53,815 --> 00:39:56,576
Put in my earbuds and
then I'll listen to the

729
00:39:56,576 --> 00:40:00,746
call and be outside.
And for me, that's kind

730
00:39:58,405 --> 00:40:03,146
of like a compromise.
You know, I'm getting away

731
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:07,135
from the computer, I'm still
doing what I need to be doing

732
00:40:03,146 --> 00:40:10,615
for work, but this is better
than me sitting in front of

733
00:40:07,135 --> 00:40:14,096
the computer all day long.
Um, I still need to figure

734
00:40:11,065 --> 00:40:17,306
out a good outside setup
because the glare on my

735
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:19,650
computer screen is really bad.
And then my umbrella

736
00:40:17,306 --> 00:40:22,590
always like, Flies away.
So one of these days

737
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:22,590
I'll figure that out.

738
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:26,740
Alex: Yeah, that'll be good.
That is a smart way

739
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:28,570
to take meetings.
Um, I would like to try that too.

740
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:31,300
I'm sure that's a nice way
to, to get away from the

741
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,860
screen, but still be working.

742
00:40:34,311 --> 00:40:36,030
Dan: Yeah, it could be.
I used to do that.A lot.

743
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,490
Uh, now, now there's
too much screen sharing.

744
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:41,371
I feel like it's hard.
You know, I, I have to

745
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,351
have my, pull my phone out
and like, look at my phone

746
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:45,210
and it's really small or
whatever, you know, every,

747
00:40:43,351 --> 00:40:47,101
every time I try to do it.
But I used to do that a lot.

748
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,811
Uh, I would actually
go in the backyard.

749
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:52,050
I, I played disc golf.
I would go and practice, like

750
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:53,400
practice putting and stuff
while my, while I was on calls.

751
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,818
Um, one of my problems with
that is I start not paying

752
00:40:56,818 --> 00:41:00,028
attention to the call when
I'm, when I'm not, when

753
00:41:00,028 --> 00:41:04,349
I'm doing other things.
So that's, you know, it, uh,

754
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:06,958
it has, it's something you,
I, I would encourage people

755
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:08,128
to try, try different things
though, and see if it works.

756
00:41:08,128 --> 00:41:10,588
You know, sometimes it
might not, might not end up

757
00:41:10,588 --> 00:41:13,108
working, but, uh, sometimes
it, you know, it can.

758
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,688
Um, but I think
that's good advice.

759
00:41:15,688 --> 00:41:17,668
And like, yeah, getting
outside is like just the

760
00:41:17,668 --> 00:41:23,188
best thing every time I.
I'm working long and I'm

761
00:41:19,798 --> 00:41:25,418
like, why do I feel like crap?
You know?And then I go out, I

762
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:31,228
walk outside, I'm like,
oh, you know, like, I'm

763
00:41:26,148 --> 00:41:33,449
like, oh yeah, the sun.
Like I don't, I don't have any

764
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:37,139
windows in my office, you know,
so it can like turn into this

765
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:41,938
weird, you know, cave situation.
And, um, sometimes it's hard

766
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:42,809
to like notice that thing
while it's happening, you know?

767
00:41:42,809 --> 00:41:45,099
It's like that.Um, what is it?
Like the, the frog?

768
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:48,148
Boiling in water slowly, or
what, I forget what, like

769
00:41:48,148 --> 00:41:49,438
how does that metaphor go?
But like, yeah.

770
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:51,179
Where, where you don't
really notice it, you know?

771
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:53,969
It's like, and, and I think,
I feel like that kind of thing

772
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,719
can creep up on you in lots
of different ways, not just if

773
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:00,478
you're in a boiling cauldron.
Um, you know?

774
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:02,199
Alex: Yeah.Yes, certainly.

775
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:03,239
Bekah: cauldron.

776
00:42:03,278 --> 00:42:07,559
Dan: Right, right.Uh, yeah.
And like getting outside

777
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:09,719
is just like, for me
especially, it is just always.

778
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,688
It always improves
my, like, everything,

779
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:16,438
you know what I mean?
It improves my, my like my

780
00:42:13,228 --> 00:42:18,509
mental whatever capacity
and my mood and my energy.

781
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:21,179
I don't know, like it's
good advice, you know?

782
00:42:21,628 --> 00:42:24,719
I also, I'm always trying to
figure out something to work

783
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:28,978
outside and yeah, there's like
glare and, you know, whatever.

784
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:29,429
I don't know.

785
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:30,608
Alex: Yeah,

786
00:42:30,688 --> 00:42:32,746
Dan: It's tough, I'm sorry,
I'm just rambling now.

787
00:42:32,746 --> 00:42:35,925
But like, there is, there's
a, a disc golf course in

788
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:39,556
Ashtabula, Ohio that's like,
I like playing there, but they

789
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:42,226
have like, in one of their
pavilions wifi, like there's

790
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:44,925
a sign that's like free wifi,
you know, it's just like in the

791
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:47,476
middle of this park, you know?
I'm like, whoa,

792
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:49,936
that is really cool.
I'm not gonna like drive

793
00:42:47,476 --> 00:42:52,576
to Ashtabula to work, but,
uh, You know, I don't know.

794
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:54,885
Um, I could see that, you
know, maybe I'll, maybe I'll

795
00:42:54,885 --> 00:42:57,106
try to push for that, you
know, in Lakewood somewhere,

796
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,181
Alex: Yeah,

797
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,056
Dan: you know, get a picnic
bench under, uh, a tree and

798
00:43:02,056 --> 00:43:04,246
I feel like then you're, then
you're in good shape because

799
00:43:05,056 --> 00:43:06,735
you don't have the glare, but
you don't have to worry about

800
00:43:06,735 --> 00:43:10,335
your umbrella flying away.
You know, it's the best,

801
00:43:08,175 --> 00:43:10,335
best of both worlds.

802
00:43:10,376 --> 00:43:11,126
Bekah: just plant a

803
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:11,621
Alex: go.

804
00:43:13,186 --> 00:43:15,916
Dan: Just gotta watch out for,
uh, mean squirrels, I guess.

805
00:43:16,286 --> 00:43:16,735
Alex: Yeah,

806
00:43:18,286 --> 00:43:19,666
Bekah: I will befriend
the squirrels.

807
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:20,490
Dan: Sure.Yeah.

808
00:43:20,545 --> 00:43:20,936
Alex: they'll try.

809
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,021
Dan: right, that's
the right call, you

810
00:43:22,126 --> 00:43:22,876
Bekah: of the squirrels, I

811
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:23,521
Dan: Ooh,

812
00:43:24,445 --> 00:43:26,065
Alex: Don't let 'em
take your food though,

813
00:43:26,155 --> 00:43:27,085
then you'll be okay.

814
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,510
Bekah: I, I think along the
lines with all the stuff

815
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,971
we've been talking about,
one of the other issues

816
00:43:32,971 --> 00:43:36,811
that's challenging is to turn
work off when work is done.

817
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,541
And I think it all comes
back to this idea of forming

818
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:42,570
good habits and finding those
things that enrich your life.

819
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:46,431
And I was even thinking
recently with remote work.

820
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:50,115
Most people are not
doing a commute, right?

821
00:43:50,115 --> 00:43:52,606
I mean, maybe they'll go to
a coworking space or coffee

822
00:43:52,606 --> 00:43:56,985
shop or something like that.
But in some ways a commute

823
00:43:54,076 --> 00:44:00,735
is a really good time to like
detox from work and then move

824
00:43:57,405 --> 00:44:04,155
on to that next thing, right?
Like, I'm going home

825
00:44:00,735 --> 00:44:07,005
and now I am home Bekah.
I'm not like developer

826
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:11,445
Bekah or whatever, you know?
Um, cuz I can't like, My

827
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:15,465
office is in my house,
and so it's nearly, it's,

828
00:44:11,925 --> 00:44:19,485
it's always there, right?
I can always step back

829
00:44:15,465 --> 00:44:22,335
into work, and I am
frequently guilty of.

830
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:29,431
Working beyond my hours or up
until the point I have to pick

831
00:44:29,431 --> 00:44:32,340
up my kids like to the minute
and then I'll just jump in the

832
00:44:32,346 --> 00:44:35,161
car and then doesn't really
give me time to turn off.

833
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:39,121
And I was talking to my old
manager yesterday, maybe,

834
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:43,231
uh, about different w work
options that I have right now.

835
00:44:43,231 --> 00:44:46,291
And um, one of them
would be contract work.

836
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:48,331
And he said, well, you
know, one of the issues

837
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:53,436
for you is going to be.
Turning, turning off like

838
00:44:49,806 --> 00:44:56,076
you're, you are going to want
to do more, so you really

839
00:44:53,436 --> 00:44:58,505
need to guard your hours and
make sure that you're not

840
00:44:56,076 --> 00:45:01,925
working beyond that amount
of time because it doesn't

841
00:44:58,505 --> 00:45:04,266
serve you to, to do that.
And it's true, like

842
00:45:02,076 --> 00:45:08,016
that is for sure.
One of my weaknesses and one of

843
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:11,496
the, the things that I, I need
to put into have it now is maybe

844
00:45:08,021 --> 00:45:15,371
like before I go pick up my
kids, Go take a 10 minute walk

845
00:45:11,496 --> 00:45:18,521
and then that, that becomes my,
my kind of commute time, right?

846
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:22,481
To clear my mind, be done
with work, and be ready to

847
00:45:22,481 --> 00:45:26,650
move on to you know, who I am
outside of work because work

848
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,271
should not be defining me.

849
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,826
Dan: Yeah, I.
I agree with that a lot.

850
00:45:33,826 --> 00:45:37,726
And that's, I think that's some,
I mean, I've been independent

851
00:45:37,755 --> 00:45:40,576
sort of work from home ish for
a very long time, you know, but

852
00:45:40,846 --> 00:45:43,516
a lot of people started doing
this when the pandemic happened.

853
00:45:43,606 --> 00:45:45,646
Uh, and I've, I've,
you know, I think it's

854
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:52,005
a pretty common thing.Um, the.
There's this, there's this

855
00:45:49,186 --> 00:45:54,585
concept of like, uh, going
through a threshold, like

856
00:45:52,005 --> 00:45:59,565
actually like spiritually,
um, can, can have a, have a

857
00:45:55,215 --> 00:46:01,365
make a, make a difference.
Make a transition in your,

858
00:45:59,565 --> 00:46:05,146
in your mind, you know?
And, um, that's like, I feel

859
00:46:01,371 --> 00:46:08,505
like that's a big part of this
is, is when you have a separate

860
00:46:05,146 --> 00:46:10,996
workplace and a separate living
space, it's, he's, it's like

861
00:46:08,505 --> 00:46:11,775
a lot easier to turn it off.
And you're like, well, okay.

862
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:14,596
And you can even like, leave
your computer at work, you

863
00:46:14,596 --> 00:46:18,385
know, and then there's no, no
temptation, but, uh, It's hard.

864
00:46:18,385 --> 00:46:19,766
It's hard when you're,
when you're home and it's

865
00:46:19,996 --> 00:46:22,675
all, it's all there and
it's, it's, you know, plus

866
00:46:22,826 --> 00:46:24,956
phones and everything.
You have your emails.I dunno.

867
00:46:25,045 --> 00:46:29,576
Yeah.It, it can be really hard.
Um, we were just talking about

868
00:46:26,786 --> 00:46:32,186
that in Virtual Coffee, um, in
my breakout room on, on Tuesday.

869
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:37,181
Alex: on that note, I think, you
know, sometimes even designating

870
00:46:37,186 --> 00:46:40,360
a part of your house, like
this is the workplace.

871
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,090
This is my desk,
this is my office.

872
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:46,811
And then just, you know, I.
Zoning it out like that.

873
00:46:46,811 --> 00:46:49,871
Like this, this is the,
the small space where I do

874
00:46:49,871 --> 00:46:53,231
my work and I'm gonna shut
this computer down and then,

875
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,690
you know, I'm only gonna
use my personal computer

876
00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:02,710
or phone or what have you.
Uh, having that separation, um,

877
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:06,610
can also sometimes help with,
with getting away from work and

878
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:06,610
then just being you, the person.

879
00:47:08,255 --> 00:47:10,266
Bekah: That's one thing I never
do is shut down my computer.

880
00:47:10,271 --> 00:47:14,195
So that's, that's probably
a good thing I should try

881
00:47:14,195 --> 00:47:15,306
every once in a while.

882
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,231
Alex: I've been pretty
consistent about it

883
00:47:19,101 --> 00:47:19,791
Bekah: Nice.

884
00:47:20,365 --> 00:47:23,465
Alex: yeah, it's, it's helps
like when I'm, when I'm done, I.

885
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:28,541
Close it down.
I might use my second screen

886
00:47:25,121 --> 00:47:30,760
from work for my personal
computer, but that's about it.

887
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:36,360
Bekah: That's great.
Uh, I love this idea,

888
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:39,760
all the things that we
talked through today about

889
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:42,615
forming these good habits.
Because it enriches us as people.

890
00:47:42,615 --> 00:47:45,226
And like you said in that tweet,
being able to take care of

891
00:47:45,226 --> 00:47:50,655
yourself is really important
to being able to, um, you

892
00:47:50,655 --> 00:47:53,505
know, like be a human being
that you wanna be, but also to

893
00:47:53,505 --> 00:47:59,476
be a good performer at work.
Because when you feel

894
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:04,036
healthy and positive and
happy, that kind of goes

895
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:07,840
everywhere in your life.
So, um, it's not something

896
00:48:04,036 --> 00:48:09,101
that's, Just like, well,
it's just good for this part.

897
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:10,960
Like, no, it's, it's
good for all of you.

898
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:17,081
So as we move to the end of
this podcast episode, what

899
00:48:17,081 --> 00:48:19,960
is one word that you would
use to describe yourself?

900
00:48:21,172 --> 00:48:22,592
Alex: I'd say inquisitive.

901
00:48:23,302 --> 00:48:24,463
Bekah: Can you tell
us a little bit more?

902
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,103
Alex: Yeah, I think that
I really just have a great

903
00:48:28,103 --> 00:48:34,253
hunger for knowledge.
Um, so I have my interests

904
00:48:29,512 --> 00:48:37,103
and like I just dive so
deep, you know, whether

905
00:48:34,253 --> 00:48:39,713
it be fruit, basketball,
languages, um, traveling.

906
00:48:40,523 --> 00:48:43,282
I just think that like,
I try to find parallels

907
00:48:43,282 --> 00:48:46,762
with those interests.
So, you know, uh, for

908
00:48:44,123 --> 00:48:49,523
example, fruit, you have
a lot of different, um,

909
00:48:46,972 --> 00:48:52,313
culture and language.
Uh, Uh, sprinkled into that.

910
00:48:52,552 --> 00:48:55,702
For example, like my sister's
favorite Mango is a Burmese

911
00:48:55,702 --> 00:48:58,583
mango and has a Burmese name
like it, and you know, it has a

912
00:48:58,583 --> 00:49:03,862
different name here in the us.
Uh, so just being able to

913
00:49:00,143 --> 00:49:08,422
find, uh, to find those
parallels, dig deep, um, on

914
00:49:03,862 --> 00:49:09,503
those types of things, I think
is really something that.

915
00:49:10,478 --> 00:49:14,438
That just brings me so much joy.
It brings more of a more

916
00:49:11,677 --> 00:49:16,327
depth and more of a story
to, to what it to my life.

917
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:20,047
And, uh, I don't just want
my life to be just simplistic

918
00:49:20,047 --> 00:49:25,177
and, uh, face value.
I like to kind of give it, give

919
00:49:21,637 --> 00:49:29,617
it a story and say, you know,
this person, uh, dude did this

920
00:49:25,177 --> 00:49:33,518
and uh, um, then now I'm eating
a product of that based on this

921
00:49:29,617 --> 00:49:37,927
story, you know, for example.
Um, and, you know,

922
00:49:34,088 --> 00:49:40,838
I just think that.
I'm always interested in

923
00:49:38,918 --> 00:49:43,657
new things and I think
I always have so much to

924
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:48,757
grow and learn in my life.
Uh, so just loving that

925
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:50,137
process and, uh, continuing
that process over time.

926
00:49:50,768 --> 00:49:53,918
And then just trying to share
that I think is just why I

927
00:49:53,918 --> 00:49:57,038
would say that I'm inquisitive
and that's just, that's just

928
00:49:57,097 --> 00:50:00,128
a big part of my myself.Yeah.

929
00:50:00,807 --> 00:50:02,737
Bekah: I love that.
That was a really

930
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:06,038
beautiful way to put that.
Well, thanks Alex for joining

931
00:50:03,188 --> 00:50:07,447
us today and for talking
through all of this with us.

932
00:50:07,447 --> 00:50:10,927
I know that I.
I feel, uh, in a happy

933
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:13,057
place right now after having
this conversation, and I

934
00:50:10,927 --> 00:50:14,318
hope that everybody else
who listens does as well.

935
00:50:14,724 --> 00:50:18,443
Alex: Yes.Thank you guys.
It was fantastic.

936
00:50:18,443 --> 00:50:21,684
I love this community, so
it's so great that we can have

937
00:50:21,684 --> 00:50:25,523
these conversations and, and
share the amazingness that

938
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:26,994
we're cultivating together.

939
00:50:27,744 --> 00:50:28,954
Dan: All right.Thanks Alex.

940
00:50:29,418 --> 00:50:29,838
