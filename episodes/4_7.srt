00:00:05,758 --> 00:00:09,146
Bekah: Hello and welcome to
Season 4, Episode 7 of the

2
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:11,537
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

3
00:00:11,537 --> 00:00:13,927
that

4
00:00:13,928 --> 00:00:17,437
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:17,437 --> 00:00:18,757
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:20,077
their coding

7
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:22,987
journey. And they're here, on
this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:24,502
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

9
00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:26,017
it with

10
00:00:26,018 --> 00:00:29,047
you. Here with me today is my
co-host, Dan.

11
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:32,445
Dan: Thanks, Bekah. Today, we
had a great time hanging out

12
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:33,794
with

13
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:37,426
Jessica Wilkins. Jessica is a
self-taught developer and staff

14
00:00:37,426 --> 00:00:39,345
author for the freeCodeCamp News
Publication. Jessica talked

15
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:41,264
about

16
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:44,115
how to get started with tech
writing, how to differentiate

17
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:46,635
between constructive criticism
and negative feedback, and how

18
00:00:46,635 --> 00:00:49,155
to

19
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:53,716
avoid things like gatekeeping in
your tech writing by eliminating

20
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:57,886
assumptions about your audience.
And avoiding terms like,

21
00:00:58,305 --> 00:01:01,786
"It's so easy," and, "just do
this!" She gave some tips

22
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:04,695
like adding a prerequisites to
your posts or other resources

23
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:10,635
and, basically, outlined her
entire process for

24
00:01:10,665 --> 00:01:13,846
all of her tech writing that she
does. And she does a lot of

25
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:16,995
it. And it's all pretty awesome.
It was a really great

26
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:19,906
conversation and I know you are
going to enjoy it.

27
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:22,867
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast like we start every

28
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:25,987
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

29
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:27,832
we're from, what we do, and a
random check-in question. We

30
00:01:27,832 --> 00:01:29,677
hope

31
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:40,533
you enjoy this episode. My name
is Bekah. I am a front-end

32
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:44,222
developer from a small town in
Ohio, and my favorite childhood

33
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:45,722
movie was "Beauty and the
Beast".

34
00:01:47,322 --> 00:01:51,343
Dan: That's a good one. Hi, my
name is Dan. I am a front-end

35
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:56,143
developer from Cleveland, Ohio.
And-- yeah, my- my favorite

36
00:01:56,143 --> 00:01:57,658
movie was s- "Star Wars". I
think if I had to pick one, it

37
00:01:57,658 --> 00:01:59,173
would--

38
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:02,352
it would be "Return of the
Jedi". Yeah, as- as a child, I

39
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:06,000
watched that-- well, just- just
a lot [chuckles]. So it's

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,798
easy choice for me.

41
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:07,668
Bekah: It's a solid choice.

42
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:08,897
Dan: Yeah.

43
00:02:08,897 --> 00:02:11,267
Jessica: Sounds pretty good. Hi,
I am Jessica Wilkins

44
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:13,637
and I am a

45
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:17,418
musician learning how to code. I
am also a technical writer for

46
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:19,683
freeCodeCamp News. And my
favorite movie was actually the

47
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:21,948
"Toy Story"

48
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:23,868
movies. And so, the original
one-- but all four of them are

49
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:25,788
amazing there.

50
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:28,457
Dan: Nice. Those are on big
rotation at our house with- with

51
00:02:28,457 --> 00:02:29,922
our kids.

52
00:02:29,923 --> 00:02:32,103
We also enjoy them. They're
[crosstalk] pretty solid.

53
00:02:32,103 --> 00:02:35,818
Jessica: I totally cried when
Andy went to college. I bawled

54
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:37,362
like a little baby. I'm like,
"Oh, my gosh. He can't leave.

55
00:02:37,362 --> 00:02:38,876
And

56
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:42,000
then he was giving his toys to
the little girl. I'm like-

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,200
Dan: Yeah.

58
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,700
Jessica: -I mean-

59
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,000
Dan: I--

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,728
Jessica: -getting teary-eyed
down-

61
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:43,948
Dan: Yes.

62
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:44,518
Jessica: -ya know? [Laughs]

63
00:02:44,927 --> 00:02:45,897
Dan: Yeah. I actually tried to
discourage that- that's

64
00:02:45,897 --> 00:02:46,867
"Toy Story 3".

65
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,048
I tried to actually discourage
"Toy Story 3" just

66
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:52,298
because it-- it's very good.
It's-- well, it is emotionally

67
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:52,867
affecting [chuckles].

68
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:53,747
Jessica: Right [laughs].

69
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,397
Dan: Absolutely.

70
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:57,752
Bekah: My- my oldest is 12, and
he'll look at me, and be like,

71
00:02:57,752 --> 00:03:00,272
"Are you crying?" "That's ..."

72
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:02,700
Jessica: Like, it's very sad. We
grew up-

73
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:02,500
Bekah: It's very sad.

74
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:02,902
Jessica: -with Andy [laughs].

75
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,812
Dan: Dude, I-- entertainment,
like, it takes on a whole new

76
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:07,491
slant

77
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:10,402
when-- especially when you have
kids cuz, like, I just find

78
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:13,223
myself being, you know, affected
by this stuff in- in

79
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:16,342
different ways, you know? And-
and it's like, I don't-- it's

80
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:16,733
matter. It's cool. it's good
stuff.

81
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:23,117
Bekah: It's been wild rereading
novels I read. As, like, a young

82
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:26,492
adult to my kids. I-- because I
always loved young adult fiction

83
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:29,867
and I

84
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:35,027
always loved the young adult
character, right? And now, as a

85
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:39,200
parent, when I read it, I
identify with the parents and

86
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,068
the novels, and

87
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:42,707
I'm like, "Oh, they don't
understand what they're doing to

88
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:47,000
their parents." [Jessica laughs]
So, yeah, it's very different.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,358
Lots of crying in young adult
novel reading too.

90
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:53,043
Dan: Yeah. At some point, I
realized it with "Calvin and

91
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:56,342
Hobbes". I was a big "Calvin and
Hobbes" fan, growing up, and

92
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:59,492
found myself recently, you know,
identifying much more [laughs]

93
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:02,962
with the parents. Anyway--

94
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:06,872
Bekah: Welcome, Jessica. It's so
great to have you here with us

95
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:11,200
today, especially because we did
a Lunch and Learn recently with

96
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,002
Jessica and

97
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,822
we'll put the link to that in
the show notes. And she did such

98
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:17,298
a good job about talking us
through writing and writing

99
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,773
career. And

100
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:23,072
it is our monthly challenge this
month. Every month, we hold a

101
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:26,492
monthly challenge. Everybody in
the community is welcome to do

102
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:30,468
it. And this is the one-year
anniversary of when we started

103
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:34,098
monthly challenges. And so it's
one of my favorites. It's the

104
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:36,123
blog writing challenge and it's
based off of NaNoWriMo â€”

105
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:38,148
National

106
00:04:38,148 --> 00:04:44,867
Novel Writing Month. And so,
Jessica is just an amazing

107
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:51,017
writer. And we kicked off the
blogging challenge. And our goal

108
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:55,757
was hit 50,000 words. That's
what's-- as a community. That's

109
00:04:55,757 --> 00:04:58,000
what it was last year. We didn't
quite make it. We almost made

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,158
it. But this year, in-- today is
Tuesday, November 9th. We have

111
00:05:01,158 --> 00:05:03,348
already--

112
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:06,408
have we-- where are we at? We're
past halfway.

113
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:10,367
Jessica: We're at 27,000, I
think? Yeah.

114
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:13,307
Bekah: And largely, in part, due
to Jessica [laughs]--

115
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:15,452
Dan: Yep. Over-- well, over
28,000. Yeah.

116
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:16,208
Jessica: Oh, cool. Cool
[chuckles].

117
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:18,857
Bekah: So, extra happy to have
you here to talk about this

118
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:20,566
challenge

119
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:24,197
with us. But before we jump into
that, we always like to get your

120
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:28,487
origin story and you have a
awesome one. So tell us a little

121
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:32,517
bit about how you got to this
point in your career.

122
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:36,000
Jessica: Yeah. it's definitely
unique there [laughs]. So, I

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,603
grew up in

124
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,147
Southern California. I grew up
in a town called Palm Springs,

125
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:39,691
which

126
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:42,212
is, like, two hours south of Los
Angeles in- in California there.

127
00:05:42,212 --> 00:05:44,732
And I

128
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:49,801
grew up with a single mom who
was a teacher. And so, I got

129
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:54,213
into music pretty early at
seven, and then just kind of

130
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:56,822
stuck with it. And it pretty
early on, I decided I'm gonna

131
00:05:56,822 --> 00:06:00,632
be a professional musician. And
so, I started with piano, and

132
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:02,597
then, I, at 11, started learning
the oboe, which is like a

133
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:04,562
woodwind

134
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:08,642
instrument. And I-- at first I
didn't really like it cuz I

135
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:09,752
didn't sound that good at it
[laughs].

136
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:10,757
Dan: Yeah.

137
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:12,182
Jessica: But then I started to
kinda get into it. I was like,

138
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:13,441
"Okay,

139
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:15,723
cool." So then, I started doing,
like, festivals, and private

140
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:19,202
lessons, and all that fun stuff.
And I decided, like, 15, I'm

141
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:23,000
gonna go-- try to go to music
school or conservatory. And go

142
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,762
down that

143
00:06:23,762 --> 00:06:27,273
route and be a classical
professional musician. And so,

144
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:31,142
when I graduated from college--
or from high school, I went on

145
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:33,348
to Eastman School of Music,
which is in Rochester, New York,

146
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:35,343
and

147
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:39,002
study there for four years on
oboe performance. And then I

148
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:42,093
graduated and went on to a
Master's at University of

149
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:44,683
Michigan, which is in Ann Arbor.
And then after that, I decided

150
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:47,273
to come back to

151
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:50,478
Southern California because the
cold was just not agreeing with

152
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,353
me. So after six years of really
cold weather, I was like, "No,

153
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:54,228
hard

154
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:58,517
pass. Let's go back to Southern
California." So, I came back and

155
00:06:58,608 --> 00:07:00,828
decided that I wanted to start
my own sheet music company and

156
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:03,500
run that-

157
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:03,500
Dan: That's cool.

158
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,362
Jessica: -and then also perform
and freelance. And so, for--

159
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:14,723
from 2015 to 2020, all I did was
perform, and record, and run my

160
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:18,413
sheet music company, and teach.
And so I was kind of busy with

161
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:22,200
all that fun stuff. And then,
2020 happened [Jessica and Dan

162
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,723
chuckles] and everything
changed.

163
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:28,200
So-- for everybody. But for me,
it was just, "Okay, go home. And

164
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,642
there's

165
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:32,028
no work for you." And I'm like,
"Great. So what am I supposed to

166
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:35,500
do now?" [Chuckles] So, I just
worked on the business and try

167
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,317
to keep that

168
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,612
going and afloat and changing
there for a few months. But

169
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:40,667
then

170
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:45,617
in June of 2020, you know, US
was going through a lot with

171
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:48,012
COVID and then race relations
with the George Floyd murder.

172
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:50,376
And

173
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:54,093
so, a lot of people were talking
about diversity issues within

174
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:56,913
many industries, including
myself, right? My industry with

175
00:07:56,913 --> 00:07:58,547
the classical world of operas
and orchestras, cuz there's a

176
00:07:58,547 --> 00:08:00,181
huge

177
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:04,382
diversity problem with black
representation, especially.

178
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:06,427
And so, people were asking me
like, "Yo, can you give me

179
00:08:06,427 --> 00:08:08,472
information

180
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:09,635
about composers I can learn
about so we can start to

181
00:08:09,635 --> 00:08:10,797
change?"

182
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:13,121
And I

183
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:15,103
decided there should be a
website. Like, there should just

184
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,888
be one place where people can
find all this stuff. And I- I

185
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:18,673
was

186
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:20,443
like, "Well, maybe I could build
it." I've never built anything,

187
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:22,213
I've

188
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:25,000
never coded before, but hey,
we've got all this time. So

189
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,717
maybe we'll learn and see what
happens. So that's how I got

190
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:29,891
into

191
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,942
programming and been doing this
for about a year and a half now.

192
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:39,300
And-- yeah. So that's kind of my
origin story and how I got into

193
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,182
where I'm at now.

194
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:44,023
Bekah: That's so awesome. Does
that site still exist out there?

195
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:46,987
Jessica: Yes. So I created
version one about six months

196
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:49,132
into

197
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:52,432
my learning and it's called the
Black Excellence Music Project.

198
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:58,222
And I built that with HTML, CSS,
and vanilla JavaScript. and then

199
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:02,898
I revisited it a few months ago,
over the summer of 2021 and

200
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:07,067
created version two, which was
built with React and Tailwind

201
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:11,597
CSS, and has more artists, and
more games, and all of this fun

202
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:13,487
stuff. And-- yeah, so this was
always like a passion project.

203
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,377
And so I

204
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:17,443
got into tech not because I
wanted to switch careers. I

205
00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:19,508
thought, initially, in June,

206
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:22,187
I was like, "Oh, this thing will
just blow over, eventually.

207
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,158
And I go back to my old life."
And that's obviously not what

208
00:09:25,158 --> 00:09:29,000
happened [laughs]. I wildly
misunderstood how, like, COVID

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,957
works. I totally-

210
00:09:29,957 --> 00:09:31,005
Bekah: Same.

211
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,700
Jessica: -thought this was just
gonna be-

212
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,388
Dan: I-- everyone did.

213
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,500
Jessica: -like a couple of
months there [laughs].

214
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,200
And I was completely wrong. So--
but-- and then I ended up--

215
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,963
yeah, I starting to get
developer work, and that was

216
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:40,726
kinda

217
00:09:40,758 --> 00:09:44,238
cool. And then I started writing
for freeCodeCamp, which was also

218
00:09:44,238 --> 00:09:47,000
kinda cool. So-- and I was like,
"Well, maybe I could have a

219
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,128
career there." So- [chuckles]
so, yeah.

220
00:09:49,648 --> 00:09:55,148
Bekah: That is so awesome. So,
that project is an open

221
00:09:55,148 --> 00:09:56,018
source project, right?

222
00:09:56,548 --> 00:10:00,268
Jessica: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And so
it's available on my personal

223
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:03,148
GitHub but it's completely open
source. It's a-- anybody could,

224
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:07,000
like, dive in there and- and if
they, you know, wanna contribute

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,957
there, I'm- I'm pretty open to
that. So, yeah.

226
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:12,847
Bekah: That is really awesome.
And, again, those links will

227
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:17,045
be in the show notes. And I just
think you seem like I-- so

228
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:21,243
driven

229
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:25,773
and motivated from everything
that you've talked about. Your

230
00:10:25,982 --> 00:10:27,902
career as a musician, you know,
at 15 years old, you decided

231
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:31,700
that you were gonna do this
thing.

232
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,743
And it-- that's not an easy
thing! [Jessica chuckles] So

233
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:38,192
you have this-- I don't know.
Tenacity or- or something. How

234
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:40,457
would you kind of describe that-
that drivenness that's allowed

235
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:42,722
you to go

236
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:45,373
through these different things
and accomplish so much.

237
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:50,253
Jessica: I think that's in large
part to both my mom and my

238
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:54,302
grandmother. And so both of them
were single parents. And so, one

239
00:10:54,302 --> 00:10:58,742
was by choice. My mom worked as
a teacher for many years. And

240
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:01,442
then, in her 40s, decided that
she wanted to adopt and have a

241
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:07,982
child. And so, she had me when
she was, like, 44 or 45. And

242
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:12,452
then, with my grandmother, she
was married, but it was

243
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:13,892
unfortunately an abusive
situation. So she had to get

244
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:15,332
out,

245
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:19,263
and get to safety, and raise two
kids by herself, and was also a

246
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:24,841
teacher. But then, went on to,
you know, own land in certain

247
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:27,107
parts of California and just be
fiercely independent. And so I

248
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:29,372
just

249
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:31,952
kinda picked up on that, where
if they decided they were gonna

250
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:34,500
do something, they just went for
it. It's-- I just

251
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,852
growing up with that type

252
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:38,500
of mindset and energy. It's,
like-- well, I guess that's just

253
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,700
what we do here [laughs]

254
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,312
if you just wanna go do
something. So when I

255
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:46,863
discovered my love for operas,
and orchestra, and this weird,

256
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:48,438
beautiful instrument of the
oboe, I was like, "I wanna go

257
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:50,013
do that." And- and, "I wanna

258
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:54,633
go achieve that." And so I just
went for it. And I- I definitely

259
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,943
didn't think I was gonna get
into the conservatory I was,

260
00:11:56,943 --> 00:11:59,253
but it ended

261
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:04,173
up working out, thankfully, but
leading up to it cuz I got

262
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:06,643
four rejections and then the
last one was an acception into

263
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,903
[chuckles] my dream

264
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:11,673
school. So at first, I was like,
"Well, maybe I'm just not

265
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:14,000
going to college." [Laughs]
And-- cuz I have four rejections

266
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,423
from other schools.

267
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:19,232
But then, at the very end, I was
accepted to Eastman. And

268
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:21,423
that was the last school I heard
back from. And I was like,

269
00:12:21,423 --> 00:12:22,500
"Okay, cool. I guess we're
going. And we're going to my

270
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,633
dream school." So that worked
out.

271
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:29,300
Dan: That's awesome. Oh, the
oboe is an interesting choice.

272
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,000
What-- wha- wha- [chuckles] do
you have any reason why-- like,

273
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,500
what made you, like, lean
towards the oboe?

274
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,427
I- I know from-- you know, I- I
know it's very

275
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:37,587
hard to learn and all of that
stuff. I was just curious about

276
00:12:37,587 --> 00:12:37,768
that.

277
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:40,638
Jessica: Yeah. So I didn't
actually choose it [laughs].

278
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:41,388
Dan: [Laughs] Sure. What happens
to it then?

279
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:44,700
Jessica: My-- [laughs] I didn't
choose it. Yeah. So, I was

280
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,217
learning piano in

281
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:48,134
elementary school. And then I
tried to pick up trumpet but

282
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,051
that

283
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:52,993
definitely was not the right fit
for me. I couldn't really make

284
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:56,000
any type of sounds and all. But
I wanted to be in band because

285
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,562
all of my

286
00:12:56,562 --> 00:13:00,913
friends were in band and I loved
music. And so I asked the band

287
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,102
director at the middle school
and I told him, I said, "Hey,

288
00:13:03,102 --> 00:13:05,800
I'm really passionate. I wanna
learn something." And his answer

289
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,300
was, "You should learn the
oboe." And I'm like, "Okay. What

290
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,300
is that?" And [laughs] he was
like, "Here." And so, he got

291
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,143
out an oboe, and he got out a
reed, and

292
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:17,000
he put it together for me, and
put it-- and he said, "Okay,

293
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,567
this is how you, you know,

294
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:21,300
blow, and this is how you make
an embouchure." And I did that,

295
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:21,657
and it

296
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:23,998
squeaked. He's like, "Perfect.
You should be our new oboe

297
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:26,500
player." [Dan laughs] I was
like, "Okay, cool." And I'm,

298
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,158
like, 11 years old. So

299
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:32,000
I've just game for anything. And
he probably totally planned

300
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,878
that. Like, "Yes! We got another
one." Cuz oboe's so rare in

301
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:39,500
schools, along with, like,
bassoon. And so that's- that's

302
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,000
probably when he heard that I
was-- I just wanna to join. And

303
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,300
he's like, "Cool. Let's just
talk her into playing this

304
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,408
thing, and- and we're all taken
care of." But I- I

305
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:49,998
guess I have to thank him for it
cuz I ended up falling in

306
00:13:49,998 --> 00:13:50,957
love with it [chuckles]. So--

307
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:53,700
Dan: Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah,
I'm-- I imagine there was--

308
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,400
there was no oboe player, you
know, before you started?

309
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,508
[Chuckles]

310
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:57,832
Jessica: Yeah, there was
actually just one.

311
00:13:57,832 --> 00:13:58,300
Dan: Oh, there was it?

312
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,000
Jessica: But then, he was like,
"We really need one other one."

313
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
[Laughs] And so it was easy to
talk at 11 year old.

314
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,148
It cuz at that age, you're just
like, "I just wanna do

315
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:09,908
anything." And you're not gonna,
like, fight it there. So--

316
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:12,932
Bekah: My oldest is learning the
trombone because someone gave us

317
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:13,773
a free trombone. So [chuckles]--

318
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:15,477
Jessica: See? There you go.
Yeah, exactly. That's how, like,

319
00:14:15,477 --> 00:14:16,617
most

320
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:18,717
kids fall into it. They're like,
"I don't know. Just give me an

321
00:14:18,717 --> 00:14:20,187
instrument. I'll figure it out."
[Chuckles]

322
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:24,567
Bekah: Yeah, that is awesome.
And-- so, it's great to hear to

323
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:27,221
your--

324
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:31,602
you've had this history of
teaching in your family. And it

325
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:35,052
sounds like you also taught
music. But you're also teaching

326
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:37,393
now through what you're doing,
you know? You did the Lunch and

327
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:41,300
Learn for us and taught us all
about writing. But also, as

328
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,000
you're writing, you're teaching.
So, you know, how much of that

329
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,301
do you think that

330
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:51,557
you're able to lean on what
you've learned from your mom and

331
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:56,447
your grandmother? Or is it
something that you thought you

332
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:59,238
really had to work hard to
acquire that skill?

333
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:03,500
Jessica: Yeah. I- I really-- you
know, when I was teaching

334
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,301
beginners-- there's a

335
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:09,113
lot of patience required when
you're teaching beginner

336
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:12,232
students, especially beginner
oboist. Because it's, like, a

337
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:15,748
really weird instrument and
there's not a lot of unnatural

338
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,807
things with it. And so it
requires a lot of patience and

339
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:21,658
just saying, "Okay, let's just
take it one step at a time." And

340
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:25,498
so I think that translates a lot
into the articles I write now. I

341
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:27,597
write a lot of beginner articles
on HTML, and CSS, and

342
00:15:27,597 --> 00:15:29,696
JavaScript,

343
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:34,018
and tutorials, and all that fun
stuff. And so I know what it's

344
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:37,607
like to just first start out in
programming. And I think a lot

345
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:40,500
of writers just skip over stuff
[chuckles] and they'll skip,

346
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,807
like, 20 steps when they're

347
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,118
writing about something. And
they'll go, "Oh, yeah. First,

348
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:47,057
you do this. And then when you
log in, just take care of this,

349
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:48,032
and then go over here," and I'm
like, "Wait, wait, wait a

350
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:49,007
minute."

351
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:51,500
Like, "How is a beginner
[chuckles] supposed to kind of

352
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,638
fill in those gaps?"

353
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:55,248
And so I really try to be
conscious about explaining

354
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:59,000
things, not assuming anything,
being patient there, as I think

355
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
that goes into my writing. Cuz
I- I just wanna help people as

356
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,293
best as I can.

357
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:09,589
Bekah: That's so important.
Because the-- it- it really

358
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:12,076
helps

359
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:17,658
to create a more welcoming and
inclusive space in tech to have

360
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:23,000
... tutorials, or guides, or
articles that don't make

361
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,077
assumptions about

362
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:27,700
the people who are reading them.
Because I can't tell you how

363
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,727
many times I

364
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:33,288
started reading something and
got very frustrated because I

365
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:35,550
was following the steps. But it
wasn't working. And I didn't

366
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,812
know

367
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:41,863
what to do or what to look for.
And that can be really hard to

368
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:45,582
navigate through, especially if
you're self-taught or you don't

369
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:50,173
have a good support system. So I
really appreciate hearing you

370
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:53,592
talk about making sure that
that's part of your process.

371
00:16:54,753 --> 00:16:58,038
Jessica: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz
it's just, like, the person came

372
00:16:58,038 --> 00:16:59,882
to learn. And so, when you're
just skipping steps or saying,

373
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:01,726
"Oh,

374
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:03,032
what odd to takes [??] to ..."
that's a pet peeve is when

375
00:17:03,032 --> 00:17:04,306
people say, "Oh,

376
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:05,417
it's so easy. You just do this."
You can't say that [laughs].

377
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,747
Like, a lot of

378
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:10,788
people do this when they're
setting up, like, GitHub for the

379
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:14,242
first time and they'll say, "Oh,
yeah. You just set this up, and

380
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,500
you just run these commands,
just open up your- your

381
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,800
terminal, it's totally fine.

382
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,252
And- and there you go." And
it's, like-- no, it's not

383
00:17:19,252 --> 00:17:22,000
totally fine [chuckles]. This is
brand new for a lot of people.

384
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,583
So you've

385
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,643
got to walk through those steps
and throw in some screenshots

386
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:28,700
and make sure that people can
follow along. Cuz it might be

387
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,691
easy for

388
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:30,877
somebody that's been doing it
for many, many years. But when

389
00:17:30,877 --> 00:17:32,062
you're

390
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:34,500
first learning it, you're going,
"Wait. Where's my terminal?

391
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,300
Where's my command prompt? How
do I type? Do I type this in

392
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,313
first and then do this?" Or,
"This is very confusing." So--

393
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:41,200
Bekah: Yeah, I'll-

394
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,500
Dan: Do you--

395
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:41,800
Bekah: -never forget-

396
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,228
Dan: Oh, go ahead.

397
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,800
Bekah: -one of the-- first times
I paired with somebody

398
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,701
is somebody that I really, like,
admired in the

399
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:51,542
industry. And I was terrified
because I didn't know. And at

400
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:56,700
that point I hadn't really been
using VS Code or- or anything

401
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,952
like that. And so, they said,
"Okay, can you open up a text

402
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:06,843
editor?" And I had no idea what
that word meant. And so I opened

403
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:09,152
up Google Docs. And they, like,
kind of went with it. And then

404
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:11,461
eventually

405
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:15,313
they were like, "Do you have
something like VS Code or Atom?"

406
00:18:16,232 --> 00:18:19,390
And I was like, "Oh, that's a
text editor." I mean, like,

407
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,718
things like that, you know, I- I
didn't know.

408
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:22,807
Jessica: Right. Right.

409
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:27,528
Bekah: I hadn't seen it written
before and I was using built-in

410
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,782
things with the lessons that I
was learning. And I remember

411
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:33,700
just that, like, sense

412
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,278
of shame that didn't belong
there, right? I- I shouldn't

413
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:41,357
be ashamed in that moment, but
when you feel like there are

414
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:45,633
assumptions like, "Oh, I should
have known that." And it's not

415
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:49,623
true. So to have people breaking
things down to avoid that makes

416
00:18:49,623 --> 00:18:52,472
it much easier for people to
keep learning.

417
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:57,442
Jessica: Yeah, exactly. Cuz, I
mean, people want to learn and-

418
00:18:57,442 --> 00:19:00,363
and I think writing is just such
an important skill. I think

419
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:04,000
everybody should write and- and
work on writing. And- and I

420
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,711
think, there's

421
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:07,353
just two levels. There's writing
technical articles and then

422
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:10,113
there's also writing about your
personal story. And so the cool

423
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:13,113
thing about this monthly
challenge is I get to do both,

424
00:19:13,113 --> 00:19:14,417
is I get to focus on some
technical stuff and then I get

425
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:15,721
to

426
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:19,000
talk about, yo some weird
stories. And I have some fun

427
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,012
articles coming up there

428
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:21,782
and just kinda sharing my story
there.

429
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,940
Dan: Yeah, I- I think that's
awesome. That balance of- of

430
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,797
... you

431
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:34,448
know, not making assumptions
about your audience and-- but-

432
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:35,618
but also still kind of getting
your point across for the thing

433
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:36,788
you're

434
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:40,278
trying to learn is- is a-- is a
hard balance to- to strike and I

435
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:43,200
think you- you do it well. Is
there-- is there anything, like,

436
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,387
if somebody was

437
00:19:44,387 --> 00:19:48,500
starting a technical article,
you know-- I mean, w-what advice

438
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
would you give?

439
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,000
Like, if- if-- what-- you know,
say the thing that I wanted to

440
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,727
learn or

441
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:56,657
that I wanted to, you know,
teach had-- required GitHub.

442
00:19:56,657 --> 00:19:59,117
You know, required you to
checkout a repository and all of

443
00:19:59,117 --> 00:20:03,300
that stuff. Would you say,
like-- would you suggest putting

444
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,800
all that stuff step-by-step

445
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,093
in or linking to, you know,
articles about, you know, about

446
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:10,982
how to do that and that kind of
thing? Like, what- what kind of

447
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:13,202
approach, you know, generally
would you-- would you suggest?

448
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:17,438
Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. So I think
it's fine if there's-- like, if

449
00:20:17,438 --> 00:20:18,882
you wanna link an article or if
you wanna have a-- right at the

450
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:20,326
very

451
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:23,778
top of your articles, just say,
prerequisites, must be familiar

452
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:27,768
with Git and GitHub. I mean, I
just wrote an article about

453
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:31,067
how to work with Node and
Nodemailer for emails. And so I

454
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:33,857
had a prerequisite saying,
"Okay, I'm not gonna cover basic

455
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,772
JavaScript [chuckles]. So it's
important that you understand

456
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:37,687
some of the

457
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:40,538
basic concepts and the basics
behind Node so we can dive

458
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:42,623
straight into this." And there
was one section where there's a

459
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,708
different

460
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:48,847
setup with how to do Google with
Nodemailer and set up all the--

461
00:20:49,688 --> 00:20:52,448
off the authentication there.
And so I did link to another

462
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:54,938
freeCodeCamp article and say,
"Okay. Here's a detailed

463
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:57,518
step-by-step process if you're
gonna use Google with

464
00:20:57,518 --> 00:21:00,428
Nodemailer. Otherwise, you could
walk through the steps that I'm

465
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:02,768
gonna show you here." So I think
that's completely fine.

466
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:06,893
There were-- if you feel like
you could write through all of

467
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:09,952
those steps in the article, I
think either approach works

468
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:12,563
there. But I- I think it's
healthy to have like a

469
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:16,222
prerequisites, if necessary,
just to let everybody know,

470
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:19,192
"Hey, if you don't have these
prerequisites, that is gonna

471
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:22,432
be kinda hard to follow." Es-
especially for some of the

472
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:25,853
tutorials. Because I- I see a
lot of people of freeCodeCamp go

473
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:29,482
through a lot of our Python
tutorials, which assume you have

474
00:21:29,482 --> 00:21:32,700
some basic knowledge. But
they're not acknowledging that

475
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,000
you have that pretty-- that

476
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,807
basic knowledge. And so they'll
come to the forum and

477
00:21:36,807 --> 00:21:39,057
they'll go, "How do I do this?"
Or, "Why does it say I have an

478
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:41,518
indentation error?" And so we'll
tell them, like, "You're doing

479
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:43,300
crazy things with your
indentation. You can't do that

480
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:43,708
in Python."

481
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,948
But they won't know that because
they just started coding

482
00:21:46,978 --> 00:21:50,278
Python, like, two days ago. And
they're trying to build, like, a

483
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:54,143
Discord bot. And so just a
properly communicating. Like,

484
00:21:54,143 --> 00:21:56,378
this is not necessarily a
beginner, or if it is, like,

485
00:21:56,378 --> 00:21:58,613
"Here some

486
00:21:58,613 --> 00:22:00,098
walkthrough steps that you can
go through. Here's a great

487
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:01,583
article

488
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,853
that lays it out." So I- I think
that's completely fine there.

489
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,702
Dan: Yeah, I love that. That
prerequisites, you know, it--

490
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,412
it's--

491
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:09,763
I think that's a great-- a great
way to set expectations for

492
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,113
the-- you

493
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:12,388
know, for the article, right?
That way you don't get down

494
00:22:12,388 --> 00:22:13,663
three

495
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:17,000
paragraphs in and become totally
lost, assuming you read

496
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,021
[laughs] the prerequisites, you
know?

497
00:22:19,048 --> 00:22:21,800
Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I- I
try to make it obvious. It-- you

498
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,488
know, a heading like, "Here you
go." [Laughs]

499
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:24,262
Dan: Right, right [laughs].
Yeah.

500
00:22:25,198 --> 00:22:27,700
Jessica: So if someone misses
it, and I was like, "Okay. Well,

501
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,557
I- I did try to warn ya
[laughs]."

502
00:22:28,962 --> 00:22:31,373
Dan: Yeah, yeah,  exactly. I
think that's great advice. Yeah.

503
00:22:33,587 --> 00:22:37,097
Bekah: Yeah, I think, too, it's
almost a really good convention

504
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:42,647
to build into something. So I
could see a software that

505
00:22:42,647 --> 00:22:47,928
hosts tech blogging. Like, tech
blogging platforms. It'd be

506
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:52,800
really nice if that was built-in
So what are the prerequisites?

507
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,200
And then you can

508
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,508
click the thing. Or you can add
the thing. And then that way,

509
00:22:56,508 --> 00:23:01,500
it already-- everybody knows
where they should look for,

510
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,146
"Okay. This

511
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,238
is what I need to know. I don't
know those things." And it also

512
00:23:05,238 --> 00:23:09,887
puts it in the writer's mind
that it makes it obvious to them

513
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:15,657
to think about it- it makes it a
deliberate decision to recognize

514
00:23:15,657 --> 00:23:18,162
who their audience is and what
they should already know coming

515
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:20,667
into this.

516
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:24,178
So I think, like, from both
perspectives, it would be really

517
00:23:24,178 --> 00:23:29,127
useful in helping us to have
these conversations about what

518
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:32,577
content is usab- usable for
different audiences.

519
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:36,000
Jessica: Right. And then there's
some tutorials where people

520
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
label it beginner but it clearly
isn't beginner. I'm like-

521
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,500
Bekah: Absolutely [??].

522
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,300
Jessica: -I don't think
beginners or I wasn't doing that

523
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,303
[laughs] when I was first
starting out.

524
00:23:46,932 --> 00:23:50,952
And so, sometimes people really
mislabel, which hurts beginners.

525
00:23:50,982 --> 00:23:52,062
And then, they're going through
it, they're like, "Well, how do

526
00:23:52,062 --> 00:23:53,142
I

527
00:23:53,143 --> 00:23:55,553
do this?" I'm like, "Well, maybe
we start off with something a

528
00:23:55,553 --> 00:24:00,000
little bit easier if- if that's
okay." [Laughs] So-- yeah. So,

529
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,107
sometimes, people-- I- I

530
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:04,300
think a lot of it has to do with
they forget what it's like

531
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,198
to be a beginner-

532
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:05,288
Dan: Yes.

533
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:06,442
Jessica: -or they rewrite
history and they're like, "Oh, I

534
00:24:06,442 --> 00:24:07,596
was

535
00:24:07,597 --> 00:24:10,928
totally doing this when I was
first learning in six months or

536
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:12,968
a year." And I was like, "No,
you probably weren't [laughs].

537
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:15,008
You probably

538
00:24:15,008 --> 00:24:16,628
just forgot that you weren't
doing those types of things."

539
00:24:16,628 --> 00:24:18,248
Cuz, I

540
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,940
mean, the first few months I was
going through freeCodeCamp and

541
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,632
going

542
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:23,483
through the certifications, but
I didn't understand how HTML,

543
00:24:23,483 --> 00:24:25,323
CSS,

544
00:24:25,323 --> 00:24:27,782
and JavaScript work together. I
was just like, "Okay, there's

545
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:30,992
these things like arrays and
objects, but how do I make a

546
00:24:30,992 --> 00:24:33,452
webpage?" So, like, I just
didn't understand how everything

547
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:38,643
connected. And so, beginners,
it's- it's a lot of information

548
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:42,000
and it's just like fire hose.
And so you just have to make

549
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,621
sure that you're not making
assumptions going, "Oh, yeah.

550
00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:45,242
You

551
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:46,727
could totally do this when
you're a beginner." And I was

552
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:48,212
like, "No. You

553
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:49,870
gotta- gotta break that down
there. That's definitely not a

554
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,528
beginner

555
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:54,468
tutorial. Let's label it
intermediate at- at best there."

556
00:24:55,512 --> 00:24:57,500
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. And you
know, to- to your point about

557
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,772
how people could

558
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:03,172
forget, you know, the-- what it
feels like to be a beginner at

559
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:04,648
it-- from experience. It's very
easy to forget that, you know,

560
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:06,123
i-it

561
00:25:06,123 --> 00:25:08,800
takes effort to remember that in
practice, I'm sure, you know? It

562
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,000
becomes-- it becomes-

563
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
Jessica: Right. Right.

564
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,500
Dan: -easier. But-- yeah. It's-
it's hard to-- it's hard

565
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,752
sometimes to put yourself back
in the-- you know, once you're

566
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,542
a few years into a career,

567
00:25:16,903 --> 00:25:20,863
to put yourself back into that
spot, you know? The-- like,

568
00:25:20,863 --> 00:25:21,792
total utter confusion
[chuckles].

569
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,238
Jessica: Right. Exactly
[laughs].

570
00:25:23,532 --> 00:25:25,500
Dan: Like, I- I- I can't
remember, you know, if I--

571
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,052
if I make my s-

572
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:28,700
like, if I think about it, I can
remember it, you know? It-- and

573
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,000
I was at the same boat. But I'm
like, "Well, I'm already

574
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
familiar [??]." I'm like-- and I
was writing, like, PHP at the

575
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,702
same t- like-- I was,

576
00:25:33,702 --> 00:25:36,000
like, learning it all at the
same time and totally didn't

577
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,038
understand how they

578
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:39,000
all connected and, you know,
somebody sent me a CSS file.

579
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,468
He's like,

580
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:42,798
"Here. Instead of using whatever
use this." And I'm like, "Well,

581
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,928
here's a bunch of black magic.
I'm just gonna drop it into my,

582
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:47,700
like-- into my program [laughs]
and- and apparently it works,"

583
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,316
you know? It--

584
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:53,147
it's-- yeah, it can be a- a hard
thing to- to remember, but

585
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:54,498
an important thing for sure.

586
00:25:55,863 --> 00:25:58,682
Bekah: So I wanna back up a
little bit because I feel like

587
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,442
we miss this very impart--
important part of the story of

588
00:26:01,442 --> 00:26:04,202
you started

589
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:07,482
learning to code and suddenly,
you're writing for freeCodeCamp.

590
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:10,113
Like, that's not something
little, alright? That's-

591
00:26:10,163 --> 00:26:11,573
Jessica: [Laughs] We totally
glossed over that. Yeah.

592
00:26:12,452 --> 00:26:15,700
Bekah: -a major accomplishment.
So I don't wanna lose that.

593
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,853
So, tell us, how did that
happen?

594
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:20,182
Jessica: Yes, it's a crazy
story, but that's kind of my

595
00:26:20,182 --> 00:26:22,041
life. But

596
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:25,942
what end up happening is around
October of 2020-- or actually

597
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:29,663
September of 2020, I decided to
join the freeCodeCamp forum

598
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:32,451
cuz like a lot of self-taught
developers, you kind of bounce

599
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:36,172
around different resources, and
then you try to find one that

600
00:26:36,173 --> 00:26:38,393
works. And so, I did a few
different things before

601
00:26:38,393 --> 00:26:41,482
freeCodeCamp, but then, I landed
on freeCodeCamp. I was like, "I

602
00:26:41,482 --> 00:26:43,147
kinda like this. Okay, cool." So
I started going through the

603
00:26:43,147 --> 00:26:44,812
first

604
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:48,232
certification, which is on HTML,
and CSS, and responsive design.

605
00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:51,847
And so I decided to just sign up
for the forum. I was like,

606
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:54,407
"Maybe I could connect with some
beginners. That be kinda cool,

607
00:26:54,518 --> 00:26:56,153
and some other developers just
talk with them." And so I--

608
00:26:56,153 --> 00:26:57,788
originally,

609
00:26:57,788 --> 00:26:59,917
I just thought I would just
kinda hang in the background and

610
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:03,488
maybe jump in once in a while.
But I ended up jumping in a lot

611
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:06,938
more, and answering questions or
just giving my perspective, and

612
00:27:06,938 --> 00:27:09,817
sharing my story. And so after
about a month of being on the

613
00:27:09,817 --> 00:27:13,667
forum, Quincy reached out to me
and he was like, "Hey, you're

614
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:17,448
super active and what's your
story? Let's talk." And so, we

615
00:27:17,448 --> 00:27:19,083
set up a Google Meet. And we
talked for about, like, 45

616
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:20,718
minutes. And we

617
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:23,897
just talked about his background
coming from a teacher into tech

618
00:27:23,897 --> 00:27:27,617
and then my background with
music. And he decided-- he said,

619
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:32,057
"Well, you should join our Forum
Moderator Team and start writing

620
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:34,000
for freeCodeCamp as a
volunteer." And I was like,

621
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,500
"Okay. I don't know what to
write about. Cuz I've just been

622
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,000
doing

623
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,300
this for, like, two seconds
[laughs]." And he said, "Just

624
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,307
share your story." And I'm like,
"Oh, I- I- I could do that. That

625
00:27:43,307 --> 00:27:46,607
sounds fun." So I decided to
just write a few posts about my

626
00:27:46,607 --> 00:27:49,607
story. So I wrote one-- my first
one was about what I enjoyed

627
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:51,332
about being a beginner. And I
wrote one article about the

628
00:27:51,332 --> 00:27:53,057
parallels

629
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:58,008
between music and ... learning
code, and programming.

630
00:27:58,188 --> 00:28:00,257
And then that was noticed by
Gatsby, and they were like,

631
00:28:00,257 --> 00:28:02,326
"Hey,

632
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:03,932
we have this blog and do you
wanna write? It-- we'll pay you.

633
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,537
And I was

634
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:08,597
like, "Yeah, that sounds fun to
me." So that I wrote about

635
00:28:08,597 --> 00:28:11,800
imposter syndrome and how I
dealt with it as a musician and

636
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,299
how I'd-- yeah, it goes in with
programming. And so now, all of

637
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:14,798
a

638
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:16,927
sudden, I start writing articles
[laughs] and just sharing my

639
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:19,056
story.

640
00:28:19,057 --> 00:28:20,452
And after a few months of doing
that, Quincy comes back to me

641
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:21,847
and says,

642
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:24,817
"Well, I've got another
proposition for you. Do you

643
00:28:24,817 --> 00:28:27,938
wanna start writing technical
articles and we'll pay you per

644
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:32,538
article?" And I was like, "I ...
don't think I could do that." So

645
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:34,293
originally, I actually said no
[chuckles] very politely because

646
00:28:34,293 --> 00:28:36,048
I just

647
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,038
didn't think I could do that.
Cuz at this point this was,

648
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:38,028
like,

649
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:42,468
six months in and around the
same time I had started my first

650
00:28:42,468 --> 00:28:45,258
developer job but I was still
kind of overwhelmed with that. I

651
00:28:45,258 --> 00:28:47,500
was working part-time at this
small company. And so I was

652
00:28:47,968 --> 00:28:50,300
like, "I don't know if I'm
qualified to- [chuckles] to

653
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,300
write technical articles. Like,

654
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,394
who is gonna believe me? Cuz I-
I don't know what I'm doing."

655
00:28:53,394 --> 00:28:55,488
And

656
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:58,768
he said, "Well, I- I think you
can. I think you really good at

657
00:28:58,768 --> 00:29:00,634
just breaking down concepts and-
and you could pick articles

658
00:29:00,634 --> 00:29:02,500
and--

659
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,729
that you feel comfortable with."
And so he had this whole Trello

660
00:29:04,729 --> 00:29:06,958
board of

661
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:10,498
topics and I could just choose
which ones I felt comfortable

662
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,377
with. So I picked all the HTML,
CSS ones. And I think maybe a

663
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:17,127
couple of JavaScript ones, and
just started from there. And

664
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:20,488
so a few months of just writing,
and getting paid per article on

665
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:26,137
my own schedule, and around
July, it was interesting.

666
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:29,887
Because I was deciding if I
actually wanted this to be a

667
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:34,000
full-time career or not. And an
opportunity came up with Disney

668
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,428
for one-- a music job. But I
ended up turning that down to

669
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:39,458
pursue software [laughs].

670
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:40,617
Dan: Oh, wow.

671
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:43,000
Jessica: Yeah [chuckles]. Which
is a whole other story in of

672
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,347
itself, right? Which

673
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:47,300
we could cover. But- but-- yeah.
And so then I was like, "Okay.

674
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,000
Well, I guess we're going into
software now [laughs] since I

675
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,518
turned down that job." And

676
00:29:51,518 --> 00:29:54,087
then Quincy reached out again,
said, "Hey, I've got a job for

677
00:29:54,087 --> 00:29:58,337
you. I want you to join my team
officially and, you know, be

678
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:00,300
writing all the time." I was
like, "Okay, cool." So it's

679
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,217
funny how

680
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:03,333
life works out, where one door
closes and then another one

681
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,448
opens

682
00:30:05,448 --> 00:30:09,988
around-- I started officially in
August of 2021, writing

683
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:13,057
articles and being part of the
author team. And so there's a

684
00:30:13,057 --> 00:30:16,077
total of four of us. And we all
come from very diverse

685
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:17,862
backgrounds and we're located
all around the world. But he'll

686
00:30:17,862 --> 00:30:19,647
now

687
00:30:19,647 --> 00:30:22,647
assign us articles. And so he'll
send us like 10 or 12 different

688
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:26,500
headlines at a time. And then we
just write [chuckles].

689
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,857
Basically, we research

690
00:30:27,857 --> 00:30:31,127
and write. So right now, I have
a whole bunch of SQL

691
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:32,912
articles. And I've been learning
about that, and just writing

692
00:30:32,912 --> 00:30:34,697
about

693
00:30:35,387 --> 00:30:38,837
SQL, basically, as well as a few
more JavaScript articles that I

694
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,798
have leftover that I need to
write about. But-- yeah. That's-

695
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,468
that's kinda my story, how I--
my weird story. How I wind up

696
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,000
at freeCodeCamp.

697
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,303
Bekah: Best story.

698
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,300
Dan: Oh, that- that's great.
Yeah. And you actually answered

699
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:48,691
it at the

700
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:51,032
end, a- a question I was going
to ask was, you know, how to

701
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:54,393
balance, like, if you're-- if
writing is, you know, you-- your

702
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,500
main job, how to balance
actually learning, you know,

703
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,800
whilst writing? But it sounds
like-- that's kinda built into

704
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,462
the job, right? [Chuckles]

705
00:30:59,788 --> 00:31:00,387
Jessica: Exactly. Yeah
[chuckles].

706
00:31:00,522 --> 00:31:01,262
Dan: It's very cool.

707
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:03,557
Jessica: Cuz there's times where
I'll get assigned articles

708
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:05,548
and I'm like, "Okay, I feel
comfortable about this." And

709
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:08,488
then, there's times where I'm
like, "I've never really worked

710
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:12,500
with this. So I guess, I'll have
to learn it [laughs]." It's

711
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,107
because I have to

712
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:16,048
write about it and convince
people that I know what I'm

713
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:18,800
talking about there. But it's-
It's really great because I- I

714
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,076
get to-- we

715
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:22,300
all have that where we are asked
to-- one of the authors was

716
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,353
asked to learn some

717
00:31:23,593 --> 00:31:26,502
PHP and writes a PHP articles.
And another one was asked to

718
00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:30,492
write C and C++, and learn that.
And so we're all down for just

719
00:31:30,492 --> 00:31:32,427
learning whatever we need to
learn and get the job done

720
00:31:32,427 --> 00:31:34,362
there.

721
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:36,893
Bekah: I love that so much.

722
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,000
Dan: That's awesome.

723
00:31:38,018 --> 00:31:38,678
Bekah: Sorry, go ahead.

724
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:41,500
Dan: I just-- that was my whole
thing. That was awesome

725
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,208
[chuckles]. That sounds awesome.

726
00:31:43,538 --> 00:31:45,800
Bekah: Well, I just, like, kind
of want to sum up your whole

727
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,048
timeline here of

728
00:31:47,048 --> 00:31:50,300
everything that's happened
because I- I think that for a

729
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,942
lot of

730
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:54,962
people that we talked to,
especially people who are trying

731
00:31:54,962 --> 00:32:00,000
to transition into a tech
career, it's where to get start?

732
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,373
And first of all, like, get
comfortable with being

733
00:32:02,373 --> 00:32:07,952
uncomfortable. But also, you
finding that spot, you had this

734
00:32:07,952 --> 00:32:11,173
opportunity because you
participated on freeCodeCamp.

735
00:32:11,192 --> 00:32:14,313
Because they reached out to you,
because they saw like, "Look,

736
00:32:14,343 --> 00:32:16,713
Jessica is awesome, and she's
here, and she's contributing."

737
00:32:16,713 --> 00:32:19,083
And that just

738
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,407
progressively led to more, and
bigger, and better things. And

739
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,731
so,

740
00:32:23,883 --> 00:32:27,700
you know, start with telling
your story, and- and writing

741
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,563
those words,

742
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:31,792
and this is, you know, that's
largely been my blogging

743
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:36,442
experience. I rarely write very
technical things because I just

744
00:32:36,442 --> 00:32:41,093
wanna get the words out on paper
or-- it's not on paper, but

745
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:45,500
put- put it out there into the
world. And- and that's a good

746
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,603
place to start.

747
00:32:47,222 --> 00:32:50,012
Jessica: Yeah. I mean, there's--
everybody has a story, and

748
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:53,192
everybody has something to talk
about and share. And so, just-

749
00:32:53,192 --> 00:32:56,163
just share with people and you'd
be surprised who reaches out. I

750
00:32:56,163 --> 00:32:57,783
mean, that's how I got my first
developer job is at-- I wasn't

751
00:32:57,783 --> 00:32:59,403
looking

752
00:32:59,403 --> 00:33:02,282
for a job. I didn't think I was
anywhere close to being ready.

753
00:33:02,492 --> 00:33:04,712
But this guy found me on the
forum. He's like, "Hey, I'm

754
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:07,798
looking for a junior." And I'm
like, "A junior in what?"

755
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:12,000
[Laughs] Like, "You want me to
write code for you?" And so,

756
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
he's like, "Yeah."

757
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,738
And- and I still work with him
to this day, and it's been an

758
00:33:16,738 --> 00:33:20,367
incredible learning experience.
But that came out of just being

759
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:23,548
active on the forum and just,
you know, writing and talking

760
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:24,298
about my story there.

761
00:33:24,729 --> 00:33:27,000
Bekah: Sorry. I was, like-- my-
my brain is split in two

762
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
different directions of- of
where to go here. I dunno. Dan,

763
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,649
do you wanna add something
before I take us off on a

764
00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:34,298
tangent?

765
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:37,023
Dan: Nope. Nope. I would say,
pick the left one.

766
00:33:37,513 --> 00:33:41,473
Bekah: The left one. Okay. My
left one was thinking about

767
00:33:41,473 --> 00:33:43,723
your-- and lit- literally in my
mind, it was-- it was on the

768
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:45,973
left [chuckles]. Your

769
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:48,000
career goals. I don't know if
you have career goals, but

770
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,823
does-- is

771
00:33:48,824 --> 00:33:51,794
writing something that you wanna
continue to do? Do you wanna

772
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:57,344
pursue the writing aspect of
coding, or- or find yourself

773
00:33:57,344 --> 00:34:00,300
somewhere in the middle, or just
see this as, you know, part of

774
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,953
a- a tangent of your journey?

775
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:06,949
Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. I- I would
like to have, at one point, a- a

776
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:10,128
traditional, like, full-time
developer job. But I def- I

777
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:12,300
definitely still want to keep
writing. And so, if there's any

778
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:12,828
way I can still

779
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:16,369
be involved, especially with
freeCodeCamp, and still write

780
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:19,817
articles for them in some sort
of capacity. Cuz I just-- I- I

781
00:34:19,818 --> 00:34:24,500
love to write. It-- I love to
just teach people and- and help

782
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,244
out wherever I can. But

783
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:29,272
I think the bigger career goal
too, is I have all these ideas

784
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:34,043
for music related tech that I
want to build. And some of them

785
00:34:34,043 --> 00:34:35,928
are crazy ideas. And I mean, I
guess all my ideas are crazy,

786
00:34:35,928 --> 00:34:37,813
but [laughs]--

787
00:34:38,054 --> 00:34:39,083
Bekah: Those are my favorite.

788
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:40,453
Jessica: I guess that's the
entrepreneurship in me where

789
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,753
it's,

790
00:34:41,753 --> 00:34:45,003
like, all my ideas are insane
but I just don't wanna let them

791
00:34:45,003 --> 00:34:45,443
go.

792
00:34:45,503 --> 00:34:45,824
Dan: It's the best ones.

793
00:34:45,824 --> 00:34:49,192
Jessica: Exactly [chuckles].
So-- yeah. So that's, like,

794
00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:51,068
the long-term goal is to just
start slowly tackling some of

795
00:34:51,068 --> 00:34:52,943
these

796
00:34:52,943 --> 00:34:57,623
ideas, and just kinda go from
there, and- and work a regular

797
00:34:57,623 --> 00:34:59,498
developer job. But then also
keep writing and- and just have

798
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:01,373
fun with it.

799
00:35:02,753 --> 00:35:05,108
Bekah: Yeah, it-- that gives me
an idea for a monthly challenge

800
00:35:05,108 --> 00:35:07,463
because I

801
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:11,993
think we- we have a big energy
channel in Slack. And a lot of

802
00:35:11,994 --> 00:35:19,494
it is just GIFs to bring us big
energy, but I- I really think

803
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:22,434
that so many of us have these
big ideas that we think are

804
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:24,038
unattainable, or this is too
big, or this is too out there,

805
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,642
right? Or-

806
00:35:25,884 --> 00:35:29,000
or there's just too many of them
to- to, like [chuckles], focus

807
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,494
on one. But if there was a big

808
00:35:31,494 --> 00:35:34,943
idea month, right? Like, we all
write down all of our big ideas

809
00:35:34,943 --> 00:35:37,148
that we wanna share them. And
work together to kind of give

810
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:39,353
feedback

811
00:35:39,353 --> 00:35:40,868
on those big ideas, and figure
out, like, where to focus or how

812
00:35:40,868 --> 00:35:42,383
to

813
00:35:42,384 --> 00:35:45,712
break things down. And then, you
know, that way, like, together,

814
00:35:45,713 --> 00:35:48,893
we have that support, but we're-
we're making progress on the

815
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:51,143
thing that we- we really enjoy
doing.

816
00:35:52,153 --> 00:35:53,728
Jessica: Exactly. I mean, I
think ideas are fun, and playing

817
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,303
around

818
00:35:55,304 --> 00:35:58,184
with them, and then trying to
implement them. And sometimes,

819
00:35:58,184 --> 00:36:00,103
people will call you crazy. I
mean, people thought I was nuts

820
00:36:00,344 --> 00:36:03,000
to- to try to do a publishing
company [chuckles]. I remember

821
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,764
I went to an

822
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:07,523
alumni event. And I was just
started with the business. And

823
00:36:07,523 --> 00:36:08,933
I, you know, you go around in
those events, and you talk to

824
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,343
small

825
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:11,649
groups of people, and it was
some sort of administrator with

826
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:12,954
the

827
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:17,304
university of Rochester. And she
was asking me what my next plans

828
00:36:17,304 --> 00:36:19,268
were. I said, "Well, you know,
I- I just moved here to LA and

829
00:36:19,268 --> 00:36:21,232
looking

830
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:24,353
for freelance work, but I also
have this sheet music business

831
00:36:24,353 --> 00:36:27,000
that I just got started." And
she was like, "Why?" I'm like,

832
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,500
"Oh, okay. Well [Jessica and Dan
laugh], let me tell you why."

833
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,333
That was-- that was a little
taken aback. I was like,

834
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,000
"Okay, great. Well, this

835
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,563
conversation won't last long
[laughs]." But-- so,

836
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:40,324
I had a few people and they're
just like, "Why would you-- why

837
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:43,000
would you do that?" [Chuckles]
But I just had a very specific

838
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,478
vision of what I

839
00:36:44,478 --> 00:36:46,548
wanted with my sheet music
business. And then people were

840
00:36:46,548 --> 00:36:48,800
surprised that it actually
turned into a business. I'm

841
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,000
like, "Well, yeah. I told you I

842
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,639
was gonna do that. And you
didn't believe me [laughs]."

843
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,748
And so-- yeah. I think sometimes
people will just reject it, and

844
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,458
then once they see it, it come
true, and they're like, "Oh,

845
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:00,168
okay. I see

846
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:01,473
it there." I mean, the same
thing happened with- with Disney

847
00:37:01,473 --> 00:37:02,778
where

848
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:05,688
people thought he was nuts to
build a park in Anaheim where

849
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:09,418
all these orange trees were, and
then, obviously, that worked out

850
00:37:09,418 --> 00:37:11,800
for him [laughs]. But initially,
people thought he was just

851
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,808
completely nuts. Like,

852
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:16,378
"Who's gonna go to this park?"
And, "Where is Anaheim?" And,

853
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:17,429
well, people were wrong there
[chuckles].

854
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:20,923
Bekah: Well, I like that
confidence that you talk about

855
00:37:20,923 --> 00:37:21,843
it with,

856
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,534
too. You're like, "Yeah, I'm
gonna do this thing cuz I wanna

857
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,800
to do it. And it's a good idea."
And at some point, people start

858
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,800
to buy into that idea because of
how you present it and the

859
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,000
confidence that you use. And,
oh, you're just, like, I love

860
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,603
how chill

861
00:37:35,603 --> 00:37:37,300
you are when you talk about
things. I'm like, "Oh yeah,

862
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,000
yeah. I would-- I would
definitely work with Jessica on

863
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,824
that," you know? [Chuckles]
Like--

864
00:37:42,068 --> 00:37:44,000
Jessica: [Laughs] I just like
going for things cuz it's like--

865
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,818
it-- yeah. It

866
00:37:44,818 --> 00:37:47,588
either works out, or it doesn't.
And if it doesn't work out, I

867
00:37:47,588 --> 00:37:50,318
learned something. I had plenty
of things that didn't work out.

868
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:53,500
But I'm glad I tried it, so I
could at least learn along the

869
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,548
way. But you--

870
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,759
sometimes, you just gotta go for
it. You can't really play safe

871
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:00,438
and- and, you know, what-- do
too risky. You don't wanna go,

872
00:38:00,438 --> 00:38:03,000
like, bankrupt or anything
crazy. But, like, you- you know,

873
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,488
you just wanna--

874
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:07,583
if you have an idea and you feel
really confident about it,

875
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:09,954
just- just go for it and take it
one step at a time there.

876
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:13,748
Dan: Yeah, it's- it's a theme
that's come up a few times on

877
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:16,200
the podcast that, you know, it
make- makes me think- think of

878
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:16,889
Structured YOLO that

879
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:20,528
Nick Taylor-- which is a phrase
he- he coined, you know?

880
00:38:20,528 --> 00:38:23,000
But it's the same sort of idea,
right? It is-- it is-- you know,

881
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,500
I mean, [chuckles] I-- you know,
I not wanna do-- go full YOLO,

882
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,778
right? But [laughs]-- but the--
but the-

883
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,074
Bekah: Yeah.

884
00:38:28,074 --> 00:38:28,614
Jessica: Exactly. Yeah.

885
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:29,659
Dan: -the Structured YOLO. Yeah.

886
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,800
Jessica: We don't wanna go all
the way out there.

887
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,300
Bekah: Yes [chuckles].

888
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:30,800
Jessica: I mean, like-

889
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,000
Dan: Yeah.

890
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:31,500
Jessica: -my busines--

891
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:32,139
Bekah: A little bit of YOLO
[chuckles].

892
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:32,918
Dan: Yeah.

893
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:34,500
Jessica: Yeah. With my business,
I wasn't like, "Okay, cool.

894
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,213
Let's just

895
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:37,224
raise all this money." No, that
would have been crazy. Cuz I

896
00:38:37,224 --> 00:38:39,000
was, like, young. Twenty
something year old that had--

897
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
didn't know what [chuckles] they

898
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,653
were doing. So I had to take
small little steps to get there.

899
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:46,673
I couldn't go that big, and- and
do some crazy fundraising goal

900
00:38:46,673 --> 00:38:49,284
or whatever when I had no clue
what I was doing. So--

901
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:53,300
Dan: Yeah. Absolutely. The-- but
the-- you know, the willingness

902
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,219
to have an idea

903
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:58,500
that is not-- one of ... normal,
I guess? Whenever, you know,

904
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,048
[chuckles] an idea

905
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:01,028
that you might run into that
conversation of with somebody

906
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:03,039
like, "Well, why? Why you doing
that?" You know? But the

907
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,937
willingness to ... jump into it,
you know, and then push through,

908
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:11,587
I think is- is- is a-- I dunno.
A valuable-- a valuable trait to

909
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:13,498
have, you know? And obviously,
it's served you-- served you

910
00:39:13,498 --> 00:39:14,000
really well.

911
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:22,224
Bekah: So, sometimes, it can be
really challenging to write

912
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:26,139
blog posts, to get started, and
to receive feedback on blog

913
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:29,289
posts,

914
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:33,239
you know? Whether that's from an
editor or somebody who has

915
00:39:33,628 --> 00:39:42,369
commented on your posts in a way
that is not ... kind. So, how do

916
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:45,838
you navigate those challenging
situations while you're writing?

917
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:49,800
Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. It's--
feedback is always interesting,

918
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,373
especially in

919
00:39:50,373 --> 00:39:51,768
the world of the internet
because people can just hide

920
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:53,163
behind their

921
00:39:53,164 --> 00:39:55,800
computers and say virtually
anything to you [chuckles] that

922
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,000
they probably wouldn't say if
you got-- if you were, like,

923
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,923
face-to-face

924
00:39:58,923 --> 00:40:02,824
with them. But I- I try to just
separate them between actual

925
00:40:02,824 --> 00:40:06,893
constructive feedback versus,
ok, this is not helpful. I'm

926
00:40:06,893 --> 00:40:09,983
just gonna move on. And so, I've
had some constructive

927
00:40:09,983 --> 00:40:12,500
feedback, like, "Oh, this is
really good." Or, "Could you,

928
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,500
like, you know, expand on this
part?" Or, "Could you talk more

929
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,213
about this?"

930
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:18,983
And I'm like, "Okay. Yeah, that
makes sense." And then, there's

931
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,500
been times where it's like,
"Well, I think it would be

932
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,193
better if you

933
00:40:22,193 --> 00:40:25,014
went into this. I mean, that's
what real developers do," or

934
00:40:25,014 --> 00:40:27,000
whatever. So I've got, like,
those comments. And I'm like,

935
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
"Okay. Well, you're not--
obviously not helpful [laughs]."

936
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,003
And so, I just learned that,

937
00:40:32,003 --> 00:40:34,500
when I was running my business,
that there's just those

938
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,113
comments that-

939
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:38,923
that people just have to, you
know, just write things and

940
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:40,393
you're just like, "Okay. I'm-
I'm just not gonna waste my

941
00:40:40,393 --> 00:40:41,863
energy on

942
00:40:41,864 --> 00:40:43,933
that. It's a-- luckily, I
haven't had too many just

943
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:46,002
absolutely

944
00:40:46,003 --> 00:40:49,063
horrific things, at least with
my programming writing.

945
00:40:49,094 --> 00:40:52,514
There was only one incident that
I had, when I was running my

946
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:54,254
sheet music company, where there
was this guy that went out of

947
00:40:54,254 --> 00:40:55,934
his

948
00:40:55,934 --> 00:41:01,054
way to make accounts, and post
race- racist memes and stuff on

949
00:41:01,054 --> 00:41:02,689
my page, and on my YouTube
channel. And I have-- of course,

950
00:41:02,689 --> 00:41:04,324
I had

951
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:06,784
to block all that. But he would
keep creating new accounts and

952
00:41:06,793 --> 00:41:09,000
was like, "You've got
threatened, like, by what I'm

953
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,653
doing that you have to spend

954
00:41:10,653 --> 00:41:12,918
time." And so, there are people
out there that just are that

955
00:41:12,918 --> 00:41:15,183
hateful

956
00:41:15,813 --> 00:41:19,563
that you just exist because of
your race or your gender. And

957
00:41:19,653 --> 00:41:22,474
it's just like, okay, you know?
It's a-- it's- it's okay to be

958
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:25,700
human and, like, ya- you know,
feel that and go, "Well, come

959
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,212
on." Yeah.

960
00:41:26,244 --> 00:41:28,500
But at the end of the day, you
just have to remember, like,

961
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:28,622
that's

962
00:41:28,643 --> 00:41:32,000
their issue, right? They--
they're just a hateful person.

963
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,453
And so you just

964
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:36,892
try to block them and- and move
on, and- and just focus on the-

965
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:39,200
the helpful, constructive
feedback as well as the positive

966
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,253
feedback to-

967
00:41:40,403 --> 00:41:42,623
to know that you're on the right
track, you're doing the right

968
00:41:42,623 --> 00:41:42,744
thing there.

969
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,313
Bekah: Yeah, I really liked
that. And that's for a long

970
00:41:46,313 --> 00:41:47,663
time, I

971
00:41:47,693 --> 00:41:52,134
stayed away from blogging on any
platform except my own blog

972
00:41:52,164 --> 00:41:55,929
because I didn't have comments
enabled. I couldn't see how many

973
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:59,000
people liked it, you know? And I
still frequently think about

974
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,917
going back

975
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:02,408
to that rather than cross
posting other places that- that

976
00:42:02,408 --> 00:42:04,898
have

977
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:08,469
those built-in things because
sometimes, it can just-- it can

978
00:42:08,469 --> 00:42:12,000
be hard. Or you put a lot of
time and effort into something,

979
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,969
and maybe two

980
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:17,119
people like it versus the thing
that I- I YOLO'ed on a Saturday

981
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:20,378
night. And then, there's all of
these hits and I'm like, "What-

982
00:42:20,378 --> 00:42:21,248
what is this?"

983
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:23,528
Jessica: Yeah. I-- I've been
there so many times. Both with,

984
00:42:23,528 --> 00:42:25,500
like, writing

985
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,179
technical articles, and then
with sheet music where I'll

986
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,709
release a new product, and I'll
be like, "Oh, this is good.

987
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:31,239
Totally

988
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:33,800
sell through. This is gonna be a
hit." And then, the sales are,

989
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,000
like, nothing. I'm like,

990
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,750
"Okay, wildly misjudged
that."[Laughs] And then I'll

991
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,500
release

992
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,773
another product, then I'm like,
"Okay, this will do okay."

993
00:42:40,773 --> 00:42:42,963
And then it ends up being a- a
breakout. I'm like, "What

994
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:46,000
happened? What did-- why did I
misjudged that?" [Laughs] And

995
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,193
it's the same thing with

996
00:42:47,193 --> 00:42:49,594
writing, where there'll be some
articles. Actually, this just

997
00:42:49,594 --> 00:42:53,253
happened with the CodePen and
Replit articles because-- I

998
00:42:53,253 --> 00:42:56,553
decided to write those because
freeCodeCamp uses both of those

999
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:59,998
tools in their certifications.
And I thought, "There really

1000
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:04,048
should be a guide to help them
since it's based on the course."

1001
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,398
And I just thought, "Okay, well,
a few people will write these.

1002
00:43:05,398 --> 00:43:06,748
Hopefully

1003
00:43:06,748 --> 00:43:08,098
they'll just refer it to them."
But then both of them were

1004
00:43:08,098 --> 00:43:09,448
retweeted

1005
00:43:09,478 --> 00:43:10,800
by the co-founders-

1006
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,000
Bekah: Yes.

1007
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,829
Jessica: -and the CEO. And I'm
like, "Okay, that was

1008
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:15,659
unexpected, but that's kinda
cool."

1009
00:43:17,081 --> 00:43:20,800
Dan: Do you ever find yourself,
like, doing tech support in

1010
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,000
comments, you know, sections
when you're writing technical-

1011
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,409
technical articles?

1012
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:25,988
Jessica: Sometimes I do. Yeah.
Yeah. Sometimes, someone's like,

1013
00:43:25,988 --> 00:43:27,567
"Oh, I

1014
00:43:27,568 --> 00:43:31,259
tried this example from your
article. It's not working." And

1015
00:43:31,259 --> 00:43:32,800
I'm like, "Oh, could you write
the code?" It's-- sometimes it's

1016
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,000
hard. Cuz [unintelligible] like
Twitter and stuff, it's not

1017
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,319
really good for writing code.
But I'm, like, I don't know,

1018
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:39,800
"Just try your best or take a
picture or something." And then

1019
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,429
I'll say, "Oh, you have this
syntax

1020
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:43,739
error right here. If you clean
that up, then you should be good

1021
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:47,829
to go." It-- it's a-- sometimes,
just kind of-- or actually this

1022
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:50,679
just happened to-- with the
NodeMailer article where they're

1023
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:53,588
like, "Oh, could you put this up
on a GitHub repo so we could

1024
00:43:53,588 --> 00:43:55,688
study it?" And I was like, "Oh,
yeah. I should totally do that."

1025
00:43:55,688 --> 00:43:57,773
Cuz I had just posted the final
code in the article. And

1026
00:43:57,773 --> 00:43:59,858
without

1027
00:43:59,858 --> 00:44:03,548
thinking, like, people would
want to study it, and, you know,

1028
00:44:03,548 --> 00:44:06,068
fork it, and all this fun stuff.
I was like, "Oh, yeah. We should

1029
00:44:06,068 --> 00:44:10,088
probably do that." So I created
a GitHub repository, and- and

1030
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:11,768
then, just shared it with them.
But sometimes, I'll kind of

1031
00:44:11,768 --> 00:44:14,018
troubleshoot with them as best
as possible. But sometimes,

1032
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:17,300
they've-- their questions are
vague. I'm like, "I'm not really

1033
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,000
sure what you're working with
[chuckles], unless we, like,

1034
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,500
get together on some sort of
Zoom meet, but I don't know,

1035
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,369
like, how feasible that is.
But-- yeah.

1036
00:44:26,273 --> 00:44:27,833
Bekah: Yeah, that doesn't scale
well, I think [chuckles].

1037
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:32,078
Dan: What about-- so you
mentioned, like, code examples

1038
00:44:32,078 --> 00:44:33,517
and stuff like

1039
00:44:33,518 --> 00:44:35,963
that. What- what kind of-- I
don't know, process or-- I guess

1040
00:44:35,963 --> 00:44:38,408
I'm looking

1041
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,861
for advice generally. But, like,
if-- you know, if you-- if your

1042
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:43,313
article involves a

1043
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,473
lot of code and stuff like that,
do you try to, like, break

1044
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:47,633
things up

1045
00:44:47,634 --> 00:44:49,419
into little bits or- or make a
link to a repository, like-- you

1046
00:44:49,419 --> 00:44:51,204
know, like you

1047
00:44:51,204 --> 00:44:52,389
mentioned? What- what kind of--
what kind of approaches do you

1048
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,574
take

1049
00:44:53,574 --> 00:44:56,213
with- w-wi- with technical
articles and with code examples?

1050
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,568
Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. So for some
of the examples, they're really

1051
00:44:58,568 --> 00:45:00,142
small,

1052
00:45:00,143 --> 00:45:04,494
like, I just wrote one about
JavaScript contains or includes

1053
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:07,704
method. And so those were, like,
really, really small

1054
00:45:07,824 --> 00:45:11,062
code examples in there. But then
one of my other articles was

1055
00:45:11,063 --> 00:45:15,500
of the MVC pattern. And so I
kind of had to struggle with how

1056
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,864
much code am I gonna include in
this? Cuz I built an app

1057
00:45:18,864 --> 00:45:22,518
specifically to talk about that
pattern. But I thought, "Okay.

1058
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:25,969
Is this gonna be a full
walkthrough tutorial or am I

1059
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:27,709
just gonna give out chunks of
it?" So it ended up working

1060
00:45:27,709 --> 00:45:29,449
where

1061
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:33,384
I said, "Okay. It's fine if they
don't work with that particular

1062
00:45:33,384 --> 00:45:35,543
stack that I was working with."
And I was working with the MERN

1063
00:45:35,543 --> 00:45:38,664
stack. But if I could just talk
about the concepts and just have

1064
00:45:38,664 --> 00:45:41,872
a few snippets of code and say,
"This is what this code does."

1065
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:44,994
Even if you're not a JavaScript
developer, at least they can--

1066
00:45:45,023 --> 00:45:48,384
there's some context, and I had
the final project there that

1067
00:45:48,384 --> 00:45:51,503
they could look at and say, "Oh,
okay. That's what she's doing

1068
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:52,838
here." And so, sometimes,
you'll-- you just wanna have,

1069
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:54,173
like, these

1070
00:45:54,173 --> 00:45:56,364
small little code examples,
sometimes, it's totally fine to

1071
00:45:56,364 --> 00:45:58,669
just link to a repository if
it's super, super long. Cuz

1072
00:45:58,669 --> 00:46:00,974
then,

1073
00:46:01,034 --> 00:46:04,034
there's that battle between
length and it's, like, how much

1074
00:46:04,034 --> 00:46:06,103
are people really gonna read
[chuckles] if it's super, super

1075
00:46:06,103 --> 00:46:08,172
long? There's

1076
00:46:08,173 --> 00:46:09,718
not too many really long
articles on freeCodeCamp.

1077
00:46:09,718 --> 00:46:11,263
There's

1078
00:46:11,264 --> 00:46:14,474
a few that are, like, at 7,000
plus words. I personally haven't

1079
00:46:14,474 --> 00:46:18,000
written any of those. Bu- but I
think, my longest was, like,

1080
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,188
twenty-- oh, no. I think my

1081
00:46:20,188 --> 00:46:21,838
longest was 3000. But that ended
up just listing off all the

1082
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:23,488
types

1083
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:28,079
of, like, free courses you could
take. But-- yeah. I try to hit

1084
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,434
that magic mark of, like,
fifteen hundred, a thousand

1085
00:46:30,434 --> 00:46:32,789
words, or less. I mean,

1086
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,009
if-- there's only so much, you
could write about some of these

1087
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:36,929
methods where it's, like, I
don't-- I can't write fifteen

1088
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:38,849
hundred words on the includes

1089
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:41,248
method for JavaScript. They--
there's only so much you could

1090
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:42,449
do there [chuckles]. Yeah.

1091
00:46:43,403 --> 00:46:45,000
Dan: Oh, that's a good note. And
I mean, it-- and that's also an-

1092
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,500
an interesting thing to, like,
keep track of, you know, when-

1093
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:53,000
when you're writing. Do you-- if
you could feel yourself getting,

1094
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,329
like, too long, you know, would
it-- do you try to cut

1095
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:58,000
down or do you think about
splitting it up but, you know,

1096
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,800
I- I suppose it's depends on,
you know, what platform you're

1097
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,800
on or whatever [chuckles]-

1098
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:01,800
Jessica: Yeah.

1099
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,800
Dan: -free ride-- freeCodeCamp
or- or not, or-- you know? But-

1100
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,000
Jessica: Right.

1101
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,268
Dan: -I just-- ge- generally-

1102
00:47:05,548 --> 00:47:05,728
Jessica: Right. Cuz I'm part-

1103
00:47:05,798 --> 00:47:06,159
Dan: -you know?

1104
00:47:06,344 --> 00:47:10,000
Jessica: of-- I just joined
dev.to, like, a week ago

1105
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
[laughs]. And-- or I think I
joined a while ago

1106
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,184
for Nick's VS Code tips, and
then just hadn't used it in--

1107
00:47:16,184 --> 00:47:19,643
for awhile then, like, rejoined,
I guess. And for the NodeMailer

1108
00:47:19,664 --> 00:47:21,248
article, I was like, "Okay.
Well, I have these ideas about

1109
00:47:21,248 --> 00:47:22,832
how to

1110
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:26,943
style the emails and how to
actually, you know, deploy it

1111
00:47:26,943 --> 00:47:29,193
to Heroku. But maybe we could
just break that up, that could

1112
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:32,673
be a separate article." And I
like how in dev.to you can link

1113
00:47:32,673 --> 00:47:35,014
to, like, create your own little
series, and it will link all the

1114
00:47:35,014 --> 00:47:38,224
articles together. So sometimes
when you're writing something,

1115
00:47:38,224 --> 00:47:41,284
you're like, "Huh, I have these
other ideas. Maybe it could be,

1116
00:47:41,284 --> 00:47:42,889
like, this is part one. And then
this is part two, and stick

1117
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:44,494
around for

1118
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,253
part three," or something. I
think that's totally fine. Just

1119
00:47:47,253 --> 00:47:48,708
so it doesn't become this
monster article. It's like, "Ah,

1120
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:50,163
I don't know if

1121
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:52,524
everybody ..." [Chuckles] It's
the same thing with videos, I

1122
00:47:52,524 --> 00:47:54,349
think. Some of the

1123
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:56,224
videos are super long [chuckles]
on some of these- these

1124
00:47:56,224 --> 00:47:58,099
channels-

1125
00:47:58,224 --> 00:47:58,344
Dan: Yeah.

1126
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:00,438
Jessica: -and I'm like, "If
somebody's gonna sit through

1127
00:48:00,438 --> 00:48:03,000
17 hours [laughs] or is that one
of those things where you just

1128
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,119
got to break it up into smaller
bite size videos?" But I guess,

1129
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:10,518
everybody has their own learning
methods. So maybe there are

1130
00:48:10,518 --> 00:48:15,318
people that will go through a 17
hour video or, you know, 7,000.

1131
00:48:15,318 --> 00:48:17,594
Bekah: My husband used to
livestream for freeCodeCamp. And

1132
00:48:17,903 --> 00:48:21,673
sometimes, he would do it for
hours and people would stay the

1133
00:48:21,673 --> 00:48:22,233
whole time.

1134
00:48:22,273 --> 00:48:22,800
Jessica: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1135
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,500
Bekah: And I'm like--

1136
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,099
Jessica: There's some, like--
yeah. I'm just like, "Wow. How?"

1137
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:26,159
[Laughs]

1138
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,028
Bekah: I just live stream for an
hour for the first-time ever,

1139
00:48:30,028 --> 00:48:33,013
probably, by myself. And I was
tired of hearing myself talk,

1140
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:35,998
like, [laughs] I

1141
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:38,159
can't imagine how everybody else
was feeling, you know?

1142
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:38,789
Jessica: Right.

1143
00:48:39,028 --> 00:48:43,500
Bekah: My attention span starts
to die. And then I-- then I

1144
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,500
start YOLO-ing things

1145
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,849
and it's- it's not- not- not the
place I wanna be [chuckles].

1146
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:50,384
Jessica: Right. Right. You know,
actually, that reminds me, Danny

1147
00:48:50,384 --> 00:48:52,169
Thompson is one where he has
these really long Twitter

1148
00:48:52,169 --> 00:48:53,954
spaces,

1149
00:48:53,983 --> 00:48:57,134
but they're really good. So
that's why he kinda-- is able to

1150
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:00,200
get away with it because, like,
for most people, they would

1151
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:00,888
kinda die off

1152
00:49:00,889 --> 00:49:03,139
after, like, at 45 minutes or an
hour, sometimes he's-- he'll go

1153
00:49:03,139 --> 00:49:05,389
for,

1154
00:49:05,389 --> 00:49:06,768
like, three hours or longer. And
then there's still, like,

1155
00:49:06,768 --> 00:49:08,147
hundreds

1156
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:10,113
of people there [laughs]. And
I'm just like, "Wow, that's

1157
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,078
kudos to him there."

1158
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:15,659
Bekah: I feel like you need
voice training for some-- or

1159
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:16,889
something,

1160
00:49:16,918 --> 00:49:19,378
you know? Like, even talking.
Even when I used to teach night

1161
00:49:19,378 --> 00:49:24,208
classes, like, three hours of
having conversation, and by the

1162
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:29,700
end, just-- my throat hurts, you
know? And like, "I am done. I-

1163
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,324
I did know

1164
00:49:30,324 --> 00:49:35,772
a teacher who was taking voice
classes for that reason. Because

1165
00:49:35,784 --> 00:49:36,998
they were saying, "It's- it's
how you're using your voice, and

1166
00:49:36,998 --> 00:49:38,212
you

1167
00:49:38,213 --> 00:49:40,793
have to do it in this different
way, and then, you'll be fine.

1168
00:49:40,793 --> 00:49:44,800
And exercise your muscle." Like
... ugh. I dunno. That's--

1169
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,949
that's a lot. I mean, I

1170
00:49:47,949 --> 00:49:50,619
think it's the same thing for
writing too. It's- it's a muscle

1171
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:53,679
that you have to exercise. So I
imagine-- I mean, you're writing

1172
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:57,517
on a lot of new topics all the
time and learning things, but

1173
00:49:57,518 --> 00:49:59,498
has the writing process gotten
easier?

1174
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,543
Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. I now have
more of like a game plan on how

1175
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:06,573
I'm gonna enter into an article.
And so I usually like to

1176
00:50:06,574 --> 00:50:09,213
start off with just a little
introductory paragraph, knowing

1177
00:50:09,213 --> 00:50:11,914
I'm probably gonna edit it later
on, but I just throw

1178
00:50:11,914 --> 00:50:13,458
something up. And then I get
into the meat of the article and

1179
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:15,002
kind

1180
00:50:15,003 --> 00:50:19,023
of flesh it out. And then, once
I clean up the actual main

1181
00:50:19,023 --> 00:50:21,994
part, then I can go through and
come up with a really good

1182
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:25,384
introductory paragraph and a
conclusion there. I try to focus

1183
00:50:25,384 --> 00:50:29,824
all my intention, you know, just
writing the main parts. And

1184
00:50:29,824 --> 00:50:32,000
sometimes, I just do like a free
write where I'll just throw

1185
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,700
words on the page and some of
them make it, some of them,

1186
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,800
yeah, I cut out sections. And
I'm like, "I don't know what

1187
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,457
this was [laughs]." I mean, that
just happened with an

1188
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:42,168
article a few weeks ago on how
to create tables and SQL. And

1189
00:50:42,168 --> 00:50:43,878
some

1190
00:50:43,878 --> 00:50:47,208
of those sections I'm like, "Why
this doesn't make any sense? I

1191
00:50:47,208 --> 00:50:50,000
don't know why this-- [laughs] I
thought this was relevant." But

1192
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,688
I was just

1193
00:50:50,688 --> 00:50:53,028
throwing words on the page. I'm
like, "Oh, I should talk about

1194
00:50:53,028 --> 00:50:56,300
this." And then I read it back.
I'm like, "No, I shouldn't have

1195
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,000
talked about that."

1196
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,784
But that-- that's an easier for
us to kinda cut things out

1197
00:50:59,784 --> 00:51:02,844
there and then just reshape it
into something acceptable that I

1198
00:51:02,844 --> 00:51:04,268
could send to the editor. And
she doesn't have to look at it

1199
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,773
and go, "What is this?" You
know? [Chuckles]

1200
00:51:08,463 --> 00:51:10,300
Dan: There's one of the benefits
of the writing medium, right?

1201
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:10,863
Is the-- that you have

1202
00:51:10,864 --> 00:51:14,000
the-- it's easier to go back and
[chuckles]- and take things

1203
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,974
out that don't make sense, you
know? Like-

1204
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:16,324
Jessica: Exactly. Yeah.

1205
00:51:16,384 --> 00:51:18,439
Dan: -as opposed to maybe a live
streamer, something like that.

1206
00:51:18,439 --> 00:51:20,914
The things just get out there.

1207
00:51:20,983 --> 00:51:21,800
Bekah: Well I think-- I mean,
like, that's the expectation of-

1208
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,200
of live streaming. So, it's like
the-

1209
00:51:23,474 --> 00:51:23,914
Dan: No, for sure.

1210
00:51:24,974 --> 00:51:31,000
Bekah: -built-in acceptable
thing. [Silence] Oh, I can't

1211
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,626
remember what's to say. Oh, I

1212
00:51:33,626 --> 00:51:38,500
know what I was gonna say
[chuckles]. Rough drafts are so

1213
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,452
important. I--

1214
00:51:39,452 --> 00:51:41,641
and I think that it's worth it
to point out that there's a

1215
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:43,830
process,

1216
00:51:43,862 --> 00:51:46,081
that you get better at that
process, and you have a rough

1217
00:51:46,081 --> 00:51:50,132
draft. No-- nobody puts out a
perfect rough draft, a perfect

1218
00:51:50,132 --> 00:51:54,141
draft, the first time. It is a
process and it does take time.

1219
00:51:55,097 --> 00:51:57,151
But, you know, just listening to
you talk about tech, Jessica,

1220
00:51:57,151 --> 00:51:59,205
you

1221
00:51:59,237 --> 00:52:04,967
communicate it so well that it's
really-- I feel like I learned a

1222
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:08,757
lot just hearing you talk about
these things. And so you can

1223
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:12,286
really appreciate that process
of learning and then-- and how

1224
00:52:12,286 --> 00:52:14,601
it impacts the way that- that
you talk about things. And I

1225
00:52:14,601 --> 00:52:16,916
imagine it--

1226
00:52:16,936 --> 00:52:18,991
that goes into interviewing and-
and stuff like that. Because if

1227
00:52:18,991 --> 00:52:21,046
you talk

1228
00:52:21,047 --> 00:52:24,547
with credibility, then people
are more likely to see you as a

1229
00:52:24,547 --> 00:52:25,536
credible person.

1230
00:52:26,356 --> 00:52:27,826
Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. And that's
the thing is that y-you wanna

1231
00:52:27,826 --> 00:52:29,296
come

1232
00:52:29,297 --> 00:52:31,187
across as how can I add value to
the company or organization.

1233
00:52:31,187 --> 00:52:33,077
If

1234
00:52:33,077 --> 00:52:34,621
you come across as, "I just
really need a job." Well, the

1235
00:52:34,621 --> 00:52:36,165
company's

1236
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:37,546
not really hiring you because
you need a job. Like, they're

1237
00:52:37,546 --> 00:52:38,926
hiring

1238
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:42,527
you because they need people to
join their team and add value.

1239
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:43,951
And so, if you come in and say,
"Here's how I can add value to

1240
00:52:43,951 --> 00:52:45,375
you," then

1241
00:52:45,376 --> 00:52:46,861
they'll listen. And- and so I- I
think, that's just coming in

1242
00:52:46,861 --> 00:52:48,346
with a

1243
00:52:48,347 --> 00:52:51,291
little bit of confidence will go
a long way there.

1244
00:52:53,206 --> 00:52:55,111
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. So
we're at about time here. But

1245
00:52:55,111 --> 00:52:57,016
are there

1246
00:52:57,016 --> 00:53:02,297
any last tips that you have for
our listeners about get this--

1247
00:53:02,297 --> 00:53:04,007
getting started with writing?

1248
00:53:04,967 --> 00:53:09,737
Jessica: I think just the best
tip is just- just get started

1249
00:53:09,737 --> 00:53:10,921
[laughs]. I think a lot of
people procrastinate because

1250
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,105
they're,

1251
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:13,906
like, I don't know what to write
about, I don't know what to do,

1252
00:53:13,907 --> 00:53:15,661
I don't know how to get started.
Just- just get started. And- and

1253
00:53:15,661 --> 00:53:17,415
just start

1254
00:53:17,416 --> 00:53:19,936
working from there. And you can
always ask for feedback within

1255
00:53:19,936 --> 00:53:21,406
your community and say, "Hey,
I'm writing this article. I

1256
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,876
dunno

1257
00:53:22,876 --> 00:53:25,186
how it really works it- it- it--
yet," or, "it needs some help."

1258
00:53:25,186 --> 00:53:27,496
But don't

1259
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,353
wait for the perfect moment to
get started writing. To- to

1260
00:53:29,353 --> 00:53:31,210
start

1261
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:32,666
writing, to start throwing some
words on the page, start

1262
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:34,121
creating

1263
00:53:34,121 --> 00:53:36,041
an outline, and then you can
shape it, and edit it down from

1264
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:37,961
there.

1265
00:53:39,271 --> 00:53:42,000
Bekah: Awesome. Thank you so
much for being here with us

1266
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,652
today. This is really great

1267

to hear you talk about this. And
your journey, you have

1268
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:49,592
so many fascinating things and
I'm- I'm really glad that we got

1269
00:53:49,592 --> 00:53:50,311
to hear them today.

1270
00:53:50,621 --> 00:53:52,181
Jessica: Yeah. Well, thank you
so much for having me.

1271
00:53:52,516 --> 00:53:54,617
Dan: Yeah. Thank you, Jessica.
We- we really appreciate it.

1272
00:53:55,411 --> 00:53:56,132
Bekah: Okay, bye.

1273
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:57,000
Jessica: Bye.
