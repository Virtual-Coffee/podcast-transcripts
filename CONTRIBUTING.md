# Contributors Guide

Welcome to the Virtual Coffee Podcast Transcript contributors guide!

We aim to make our podcast transcripts more accessible and enjoyable to read by all audiences. At the moment, the transcripts are automatically generated, and they contain some mistakes.
We need to edit the transcripts manually by listening to the episode and improving it.

So, thank you so much for considering contributing to this repository. We really appreciate all the contributors who try to make this space better.

We take our [Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct) very seriously, and all contributors must abide by it. If you believe someone has violated the Code of Conduct, please fill out our [CoC Violation Form](https://virtualcoffee.io/report-coc-violation).

---

- If you find an [existing issue](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/podcast-transcripts/issues) you want to work on, comment on it, and a maintainer will respond and assign it to you. It can only be assigned to you if you've commented on the issue.
- Once you've been assigned the issue, fork the repo, create a local copy of that fork, create a new branch. and work on your changes that way.
- In your working directory, install the dependencies by running the command `yarn`.
- After you finish your work, check for the invalid timestamp formatting and fix indexing issues by running `yarn check-srt`. Then fix the incorrect timestamps format manually, if any.

**Feel free to ask for help** in any part of this process if you need clarification. Project maintainers can try and get you through the parts confusing you as soon as they can.
